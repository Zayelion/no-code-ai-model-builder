{"prompt":"JAG: Hello? Hello, Ashley. Hi there. Hi, how's it going?\nASHLEY: Good. How are you?\nJAG: Doing well. Thank you so much. Thanks for joining the call today.\nASHLEY: Hi, thanks bye.\nJAG: Yeah, no worries. My name is Jag. I'm an account executive here at our company. I know you're working with Francesca previously, but I'll be your point of contact going forward. Basically, Ashley, I come from a project management and I was actually doing some linked in stocking and I'm very excited to actually talk to you because you're a fellow, us a few grad.\nASHLEY: Hello. Yeah, that's funny. Are you? Where are you based?\nJAG: It's so funny. I saw that I was like, wait, I should tell her that I'm in theory… that's…\nASHLEY: Wow.\nJAG: Yeah. Where are you based out of?\nASHLEY: I'm in Burnaby in.\nJAG: Burnaby got it. So I'm guessing after the Burnaby campus a lot.\nASHLEY: Yes, yes, I did.\nJAG: Yeah, I did. I went to the, sorry until sciences made me go to the brand to be one. So that was fun always.\nASHLEY: Yeah. The story, when was always interesting being right inside that mall.\nJAG: But we had the food court. It was such a good food court though.\nASHLEY: Sure. It was still, it's still felt weird.\nJAG: Okay. I'll give that to you just because that's but the SF, you Berta, be building had like the worst or around it because the rumors, right? It was built by the prison architect guy. So.\nASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, I know it, it's not a very… I don't well, it's but, yeah, yeah.\nJAG: Well, that's awesome. Good. Super happy to speak with you. And again, I saw that your three months into your new role, congratulations. Yeah. And so, how is everything going on at critical start? You know, I'm guessing you coming in probably want to revamp the enablement culture a bit kind of give it a shot in the arm. So, how is this LMS project kind of falling into your lap? And why are we even looking at some today?\nASHLEY: Yes, certainly. So you're 100 percent correct? So I'm really looking at revamping all of our learning strategy. I'm not only from a sales perspective but also from our channel perspective because right now we do have an LMS that we're utilizing today, which one? So we're using Skilljar… that I'm not 100 percent sure if that is the right tool for us as we continue to grow our business. But we're looking for a more robust tool that will enable us to scale efforts not only internally from a sales perspective but also to our partner community and to our… internal sorry, company wide training as well. So, yeah, so kind of multifaceted approach. Yeah.\nJAG: Yeah, no, absolutely. And especially when we talk about scaling Ashley, you know, things come into play where it's more about Automation and kind of making things talk and making things a bit more streamline. So we're more focused on the value out of whatever we're trying to do rather than all the little nitty gritty stuff. So what are some things that you're finding need to be kind, have that Skilljar isn't really doing for you right now? What are some of those gaps in there for you?\nASHLEY: So I just like a little bit more… integration as it relates to teams. So we use teams for our web conferencing, and we would love to utilize the live training modules that are existing teams today and Skilljar. And from what I understand, it works integrates better with ZoomInfo. But, you know, where 18 shop and I don't necessarily want to switch gears just for… training.\nJAG: Yeah, no, absolutely.\nASHLEY: Yeah. And just in general, I'm just look at exploring other options like our Skilljar licensing is coming up. So this is that opportunity for us to reevaluate where we are at and does it make sense for us to move?\nJAG: No, absolutely. And yeah, thank you so much for keeping us in mind as well. Those are definitely challenges we can start helping you with and kind of showing you how we can start streamlining those things and making some more scaleable. Just a couple of questions regarding your vision when it comes to your enablement program, if you don't mind, Ashley, is that okay? Sure. Yeah, absolutely. So one of my questions that I really want to know is, you know, if I'm a new rep, critical start and it's my first day. How does that look like? You know, how do I go from here's? My first data actually being efficient on my job. How does that?\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They talked about the LMS project that is part of revamping Critical Start's learning strategy from a sales perspective as well as to its partner community and company-wide training initiatives.\n• Ashley mentioned challenges with Skilljar not integrating well with Teams for web conferencing, live training modules, etc., so they are considering other options when it comes time for renewal of licensing agreement.\n• Skilljar license is expiring soon, and Ashley is exploring other options. END"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: Yeah. So right now, we're in the early stages of that model because that's what I'm kinda put in here to build out. But today, what it looks like is that they generally will come on site into our office. We have a dedicated sales trainer that don't spend the day with them, Ashley the week with them going over some core concepts and key pieces. And then they are also assigned content in Skilljar for them to review in addition to looking at resources within high spot as well to supplement some of that knowledge. The going forward, what that's gonna look like is that they're going to be domestically enrolled into Skilljar or whatever LMS, we choose everything that they learned within that first week is going to be course of five. So that we have a way for us to test their retention and knowledge up on a it's subject by subject level. And then we're also doing some level of certification. So actually that is also one of the things that Skilljar is lacking is that I wanted to do some backup pitch certification. So our reps, you know, deliver our corporate message or corporate pitch and then have them uploaded for our leadership team to be able to assess them. That's something that's not really possible. That is something that we'd want to do.\nJAG: Okay. Absolutely. And that's something you can do with our company. Ashley and I'll definitely show you that in our demo. No one question. I also had, you know, especially when you talk about scaling, right? So to certain things like you know, having the trainer sit with the person when they first start of course, when we course, if I everything or are we looking to kinda not have that trainer be there physically and only being used when those certain questions or that haven't been answered previously? Like how do you want to manage their time as well?\nASHLEY: Yeah. So what we would like to do is one have new hires big coming in on monthly, John, so that when we do onboarding, it'd become a lot more programmatic. Yeah, exactly. And then, but yeah, it, how I see it is that it's it Instructor led plus that horse if I can't post content so that sellers have two vehicles to learn. One is to live engagement. And the second one is, hey here's, a short course that kind of talk through exactly what your life presenter reviewed as well. But we're also gonna test your retention of it. So that way we kind of have that multi touch engagement for folks because, you know, if you just do it live session, things go in when you're out that.\nJAG: Got it. So, I like that. It's kinda like a little hybrid approach right there, right? So you're doing asynchronous training by yourself. But the same time even your live trainings have that course element to it that you're still, this is not just some Webinar you're attending but it's part of your onboarding and there's it kind of builds off of that. Is that correct?\nASHLEY: Yes, that's right.\nJAG: That's awesome. I love that. That's fine. I might steal some of that stuff or ours too. Now. Couple of questions for, you know, kind of putting this together is awesome. And you had mentioned as well. You know, we might even do some things where our workflows would be like, hey, you do a pitch for us, you submitted into the LMS that goes to the specific leader who can then provide feedback and things like that. So in terms of scalability, when we were talking about scaling, Ashley, do you want, you know, we don't really want especially when we're trying to scale is to have that one person have all the admin duties. Do you see any value as you're scaling to give managers and things like that? Certain admin duty so they can develop their own teams, kind of manage their own teams? Well, holistically, you have the one admin who kinda controls all what's the vision there.\nASHLEY: Yeah, definitely. And I see that being more applicable for our company wide training, that in our HR team is very interested in building out. So that's certainly a use case that can happen.\nJAG: That's fantastic. And when we're doing all this, right? As we're building out this program, what's your vision for how you're going to communicate its impact, the leadership, Ashley, because I know especially in enablement, there's number metrics, things like that you need to communicate, how are you gonna show the impact that you're learning progress and all kinds of doing for the company?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Ashley is in the early stages of building a model for onboarding new hires into their office.\n• New employees will be given core concepts and key pieces by a dedicated sales trainer, as well as assigned content to review on Skilljar and High Spot.\n• Going forward, they will be enrolled into an LMS where they can test their knowledge subject-by-subject level with certification also being done through this system.\n• Ashley plans to have new hires come in monthly so that onboarding becomes more programmatic while offering both instructor led training and asynchronous courses for sellers to learn from.\n• Managers may have certain administrative duties delegated when scaling which would enable them to develop teams holistically under one admin who controls the vision of it all.\n• Ashley has a plan for communicating impactful metrics of progress made by learning initiatives within her company leadership team going forward. END"}
{"prompt":"ASHLEY: So we're going to be also something that we're missing from a Skilljar perspective. Is that gamification? Okay. So what I would like to be able to do is show a leader board of all the folks that have completed have not anti that to where they are from a performance perspective. So where I see it as like I'd like to create an enablement dashboard that shows them, hey, here, is there training KPI here's their sales tools usage, KPI'S and here's where they are from a sales performance perspective. So that when ours man leadership team is coaching their sellers, they have that one centralized view on what they need to speak to that seller about. So if the sellers not doing so well on a deal perspective or, you know, their wind rates, not that great. Well, hey, look at what they are, where they are on their training perspective or look at where they are from a total utilization?\nJAG: Audits or some sort of engagement data to say, hey, this seller who has come in and is brought in all this revenue. They're using the system actively. They're actively participating in the learning programs are the ones that are in here, their engagement numbers. And that's the reason for their performance tying it. Okay. Got it. That's fantastic. Awesome. And one more question is, you know, engagement becomes interesting here, right? Because you can fill in LMS with a bunch of content engagement numbers. We see go down because I can't find something I want, right? As a seller, if I'm out in the field, do you have field teams by any chance? Ashley?\nASHLEY: You do?\nJAG: Okay. So perfect. So if I'm in the field, things like that, like I'm assuming you're probably gonna have a big mobile need as well for your field teams and please do look for first party out that comes with the LMS. You don't want to get a third party app and have some consistency issues and things like that. But when you fill an LMS, another point comes to personalization on how easy can I find things that are relevant to me in the time that I'm looking for as well? Have you thought about any strategies to have that personalized learning for your different?\nASHLEY: Yes. So how we would likely do that is through high spot. So with high spot, we have them, so we would link that content to high spot. And with high spot, you have the option of within Salesforce highlighting to sellers based on where they are on the sales process journey. So if they're in a competitive, because what I want to be from, to do is like, so the sellers are in a competitive situation and they have their in that field in Salesforce. Hey, here all the high spot documents as well as potential training documents through high spot that would potentially aligned to that, so that it surfaces that up for them.\nJAG: God is high spot. Basically your content kinda like document repository. Yes. Got it. And did you get any stats on engagements and how it to? Okay, perfect. Fantastic. Okay. So possibly some integration there with high spot as well. Any need for that or no?\nASHLEY: I'm interested to see what may offer but yeah.\nJAG: Yeah, I can take a look. I mean, worst case scenario, you can always put your link in the courses as well. So should they want to refer it. But our company also has a full document management system within it. So if you ever wanted to consolidate your systems into one, that's also an option as well. And did you mentioned you're a Microsoft shop or Microsoft?\nASHLEY: Yep. Yep.\nJAG: Fantastic. So your Microsoft teams requirements, we can fulfill that as well. Not an issue there. Now, one of the things I also had a question for you for Ashley as, you know, Notifications when it comes to compliance or certification training, of course, there's a lotta reminders that need to go out, things like that and possibly even using gamification to get the good behavior, finishing it early. Have you thought about strategies or would that be more gamification driven?\nASHLEY: That would be gamification driven at this point.\nJAG: Fantastic. Awesome. And a couple of more questions. If you don't mind one of the things that here at our company, we really strive to do is sharing best practices between the teams and also then sharing that with our enablement team who can then spread it out kind of wider throughout the organization. How was your strategy to collecting best practices? Sharing best practices, all that informal or?\nASHLEY: Sorry, sorry. Do you mean internally amongst our sales organization absolutely. So we do, I do attended a lot of their QB, ours to learn to listen to what deals are working, what deals are not. And we have regular deal review calls as well. So that gives me a good insight into the sales process and insight into where we need for the support from a messaging standpoint. So that's kind of where I'm sourcing a lot of those best practices.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ashley is looking to create an enablement dashboard that shows the performance of sellers from a training, sales tools usage and sales perspective.\n• Jag suggests integrating High Spot into Salesforce to provide personalized learning for different roles as well as possibly utilizing gamification strategies to encourage good behavior in completing tasks early.\n• Ashley sources best practices internally through attending QBs and deal review calls. END"}
{"prompt":"JAG: Got it. And when, you know, when you're creating these roles so to speak, are you assigning any skills to these roles? So for example, if you are a business development rep, you should have great outbound calling skills, communication skills, and are you tracking how people are progressing through the skills at all? Is there any down?\nASHLEY: No, not yet. Where I would say it's that's probably something we'd want to explore further down the road but not at this time.\nJAG: No. Absolutely. Any other things that might be of importance of either this year next year. Ashley. And the reason I ask is, you know, as, you know, an LMS project is, you know, something you want to do every year. So just wanna make sure we cover your requirements now, but also next year and possibly even the year after as well. Any other strategies that might be coming?\nASHLEY: No, I would say that that's definitely the big, the biggest ones that I'm looking to tackle at this time.\nJAG: Yeah, fantastic. And now, what about your content strategy? Ashley? Do you have already make content, you know, with the economy changing with the, all the sales info is coming, how are you keeping your team updated with content?\nASHLEY: So we do have some existing content today that we would be able to plug into our into Skilljar. I'm actually in the process right now of building out all of that content up because a lot of those courses that I talked about doing business today, a lot of it is just being delivered verbally as part of one on one meetings. So that's where our biggest gap is.\nJAG: Are you seeing kind of like a bottleneck in content creation is kind of taking your time away or is that kind of have a process you've got pretty much covered?\nASHLEY: It, yeah, I could always use the help.\nJAG: Absolutely. I ask because we do have an AI tool that takes any website PDF and our AI extracts all the information and kinda create some micro learning video. Yeah. So it should content ever be a bottleneck for you. We were basically a one stop shop, Ashley, like I don't know how much research you've done on our company, but basically content creation, premium content, an LMS deeper reporting, a BI tool like we kinda harder the one stop shop. So a lot of different solutions to not only kind of meet you where you are right now but what you're looking to grow into as well. Right? Yeah. Now, what about your kind of back end support? Ashley, do you have a large team that will be working on the LMS? Is it going to be like a single admin? What, what's the view there?\nASHLEY: So I've got a team of myself and one other person. So we would be the primary admin. And then as I said, our HR team would want to be admins as well as part of that for the company wide learning. And that's going to be about a couple of folks on that side as well.\nJAG: Got it. And for your HR team, Ashley, do they have any requirements themselves that they want to focus on this year? Is it more so streamlining onboarding or is it Professional development to kinda continue and keep that retention go?\nASHLEY: Yeah. So I think it's a little bit of both. So we actually have an open wreck right now for a training and development manager in HR and that will be there charter to build out. But from, you know, my past conversations with our head of HR, what she's looking to have his Professional development, I'm looking to build in and further refine the company wide onboarding. I'm actually one of the things that she was interested in integrating is that LinkedIn learning. So if that is something that you have any integration with that love to kind of hear what that looks like.\nJAG: Yeah, ours is native and it's out of the box. So there would be no charge of bringing that in. And so basically how it works, Ashley is you would bring LinkedIn learning into our company and now that it's an our company, you'll get all the tracking of it as well. So you'll get all the stats but it'll be all LinkedIn learning content as well.\nASHLEY: Got it.\nJAG: Yeah. So that's not an issue. We can make that happen. What HR system do you use by any chance? That way I can ensure that we're integrated with that as well.\nASHLEY: You know what? I'm not 100 percent sure.\nJAG: Okay. No worries. So we can always find that out later. But most all of the major ones we integrate with anyway. So not too concerned about that. Now, kinda taking a view of the project from like a 30,000 foot view, Ashley, what are we talking about when it comes to timelines? You know, have you created a timeline for vendor selection, possibly when we want to be implemented by things like that?\nASHLEY: Yes. So our, I believe our licensing expires at the end of this next month. So it would be a pretty quick turnaround.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Ashley is looking to explore further down the road assigning skills to roles and tracking progress through them, but not at this time.\n• She has some existing content that needs plugging into Skilljar, which she is currently in the process of doing as much of it was previously delivered verbally.\n• Ashley requires back end support from a team consisting of herself and one other person; HR also wants admins for company-wide learning with two people assigned to it.\n• The HR team are looking for Professional Development opportunities as well as streamlining onboarding processes and integrating LinkedIn Learning - natively integrated with no charge.\n• Ashley's licensing expires at the end of next month so there will be a quick turnaround on vendor selection and implementation timelines.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"JAG: Got it. So we gotta move quick. Yeah, awesome. No worries. And if you don't mind me asking, is there a budget already made? I just want to ensure like number one, we meet your requirements, but number two, we meet the commercials as well.\nASHLEY: There, I'll have to check exactly what the cost is of Skilljar. So I wouldn't be able to tell you on.\nJAG: No worries. Now because of the kind of condensed time line here. Ashley… I just want to be very transparent with you with how it would work. Is number one, I'd want to get you in for a demo, Aesop. That way, at least we can show you the system and get any questions answered, things like that. And number two, then it would be, you know, if any other departments kinda wanna get in things like that. But hypothetically even if you were to sign a contract today, it would take about two two, three weeks to get you in the platform, kind of even get your onboarding started. Now with that timing. Is that a red flag by any chance? What are your thoughts there?\nASHLEY: No, I'm okay with that.\nJAG: Okay. Fantastic. Just wanted to kind of be transparent and be very open with you there as well. Thank you for that. Now, one last question for you, Ashley, do you have by any means a list of requirements? I would love to kind of fill that out for you that way, at least you have your requirements filled out and understand what the table can and can't do particularly for your use case.\nASHLEY: No, I don't have one explicitly written now?\nJAG: No worries. No worries. But other than that, I know Mike's pepper you with a lot of questions. I don't have any more, but do you have any questions for me? Ashley? I know we have nine minutes. So we'd love to answer any questions you might have.\nASHLEY: Hello? Nope. No, not at this time.\nJAG: Fantastic. So as I mentioned, would love to get you in for that personalized demo. Do you have your calendar open in front of you by?\nASHLEY: I do.\nJAG: Fantastic. Give me one second here. How about… would next, actually would no, you're Pacific Time, right? Yeah. Would Thursday 11 30 work for you?\nASHLEY: Yes, that's fine.\nJAG: That's fine. Yeah, fantastic. So, I'll send that over as well, Ashley. And what I'll do is I'll send you over a little kind of feature sheet. We have that way you kind of understand what comes out of the box with our company, the more information I can give you the better of course. And then did you want me to send you any kind of like client portals? We might have examples of things like that so you can take a peek?\nASHLEY: Yeah, that would be very helpful.\nJAG: Fantastic. So I'll send that off and any other questions I'm just a couple of clicks away?\nASHLEY: Sounds good.\nJAG: Fantastic. Well, thank you so much for joining. Hope you have a wonderful long weekend. I can finally say to someone on camera that the weather is looking fantastic going into the weekend. So hopefully it stays like that. I don't get people for people from Vancouver on the call. So this is off.\nASHLEY: Yeah. Well, the drought, Philly?\nJAG: I know, right? So I'm hoping to go golfing but we'll see it's quite guy out there.\nASHLEY: It is definitely.\nJAG: Any plans for the weekend for you?\nASHLEY: Yeah, just us, but he sometime a family, it's thanksgiving.\nJAG: That's fantastic.

{"prompt":"NICHOLE’S: People for adults or the company, we're training our customers. We have about 200 different classes that we offer for our customers and they range anywhere they're all industry related, but it can be anywhere from… appliance repair to an HP AC, too soft skills for maintenance tags or even, or the office for property management segment for, you know… fair housing or marketing skills or anything. So our primary segment that we support is the property management segment. I'd say secondary to that would be like hospitality or senior housing. And so we do, we will be expanding to all pros so that'll include like restoration companies, and renovation companies and things like that. We use. James is our platform… for the virtual environment. Everything is live Instructor led. We do not have a prerecorded database. We may have some of that moving forward but it's the majority of it is to stay live Instructor lead. We're also going to have a blended learning environment where we're going to have some in person sessions as well. So we probably 90 percent virtual, our in person will be limited. So what we really need is not so much the front half of, you know, like I said, we utilize the teams were fine with teams. We need more of the back office management. We need the data management and the user for the user to be able to go in and create their own profile. You'll be able to select what classes they wanna take, be able to track their own, you know, any time they could check, I took this class. I didn't take this class or whatever have certificates of completion if we need a central place where we could communicate.

So all of our communication is truly… you know, hey, here, the directions for the class, and then utilizing, you know, teams are calendar outlook, calendar or what happens to be defined creates challenges for us. It's a huge manual lift because then, you know, first of all, we got to create the word document. It's gonna have the correct information on it. We gotta have the correct class, the time Instructor name, the rest of the box stays the same but we often will put a link in there to join the class because people don't know how to except calendar invites. For some reason. It's so we always have multiple, you know, we try to touch them or multiple times, you know, like here's the directions, it's a virtual classrooms.

Yeah, by the way, you're supposed to join class tomorrow. Also, we would like to be able too have… query where they could register for a series instead of an individual session. Okay?

How often are we having discussions? Did I have our customers are usually, you know, maintenance guy or employee on a prop pretty, but that property is under a management company.

What that looks like just so that I know what I might do on my end to support you as you kind of share this information forward?\nNICHOLE’S: So primarily guys, we've been talking about this for quite some time here here's the issue… all mro, which is maintenance repair operators, suppliers offer education for their customers. Everybody. So that's not something. What's new is, you know, COVID, hey, we went 100 percent virtual. We have over 12 months. Wow. Well, you know, that's a good thing. A bad thing is as, you know, I mean, we've definitely capitalized on it, but this department wasn't its own like we weren't a training department. So it's more like the national accounts team. The sales side would say I have customer XYZ, they want training and compliance is, let me go find some guy that I'm in a contract to create this class for this customer. So once it really a regimented academy, right? And this is more of a sales tax benefits that they would or orchestrate. So right now, and I was a contract trainer for them to like tiny here. So three years ago they brought me on, I have to, you know, vision of creating this academy, you know, standing alone, we completely different than our, in our own silo. So, you know, the first year, you know, obviously COVID, everything's crazy. We just started throwing stuff at the moment. You wouldn't stick and we've just been moving pretty one foot front of the other since then. So we don't have a lot of historical data to demonstrate, but an LMS would really do for them. So what we've had is tremendous Growth. So we started tracking basically 2021. Andrea joined us in December of 2020. So January 2020 wide, we actually got started to get, you know, a handle on the data. So on the twentieth 2021 be trained about 2,900 professionals by key one of 2022 we were already and 3,400 where it's 6,000 right now here today, and we haven't even opened this up to all the pro is we are solely at the property management segment and we are only virtual.\nTREVOR: Helpful.\nNICHOLE’S: Really, really growing and we want to continue to grow but there's no way that Andrea and I can manage the data. I mean, we are already at the point where you're over capacity at the point we are right now because the manual lift, we make mistakes were humid, but the manual lift is it's too many mistakes for who we are.\nANDREA: Yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Trevor and Andrea discussed the need for a Learning Management System (LMS) due to their manual lift being overcapacity.\n• Nichole provided an overview of her role as customer training manager, which is part of a department that provides customer facing education.\n• Trevor asked about previous experience with LMS solutions and any compelling events or sponsorship towards moving this project forward internally.\n• Nichole shared that they have experienced tremendous growth since January 2021, having trained approximately 6,000 professionals from the property management segment in virtual settings only thus far.\n END"}
{"prompt":"TREVOR: Hi, gotcha. Yeah. So the compelling event from the sounds of things is really just kind of the exponential Growth that you've had to date and are likely continuing, are likely will continue to have. And therefore, rather than managing everything manually, you're it sounds like you're at a point now where it does make sense to look at the option of automating as much as possible to assist.\nRYLEY: God.\nNICHOLE’S: One of ours kinda dumping or roadblocks. So this has been that LMS systems traditionally are per user basis.\nTREVOR: Yeah.\nNICHOLE’S: With that template chat for our month, that's just a point because we could have somebody who takes the classic January and never ever comes back.\nTREVOR: Hi.\nNICHOLE’S: Can I have only takes three costs here? I can have, somebody has to teach, takes the class three or four times. So, you know, it's a variety. And so that back door, it's just, it's you know, loves that they're going to give me a blank.\nTREVOR: Yeah. Well, good news there. So.\nNICHOLE’S: Have as far as support it sponsorship. We do have the sponsorship support senior management. We're just kinda like the initial like, okay, let's go out there and see what we have. What solutions are possibly there, narrow that down to get them in front of, you know, my boss who can then narrow it down. And then we're going to get it down to. Okay here's. The proposals here's, the dollars and cents. Yeah, this is what we want.\nTREVOR: Yeah, awesome. That's great. And I think just to kind of address I really important point that you called out just a few seconds ago and you're correct? There are a lot of learning management solutions that follow more of that named license model where once that seat has been taken up, it's been taken up for the year, right? But with your business there, it's very rotational in terms of who needs to come into the platform. Is you mentioned they might be, they're taking a couple of courses over a month next month, they might not be there, right? So of course, you don't want to carry that cost forward for the next 11 months. So our company actually follows what we refer to was a monthly active user model. So how that's defined an active user is someone that logs into the platform and actually participate in a course. So we actually won't qualify them as being active unless they open up… the virtual or sorry the web conferencing link or be marked for attendance as part of this having attended and I LT session and in person session. So, but needless to say, the biggest differentiator for us is we've got different tiers. So as you scale, you know, it's a sliding scale model. So the per user cost and getting lower and lower, the higher you go up. Of course, your overall contract increases. But that per user cost comes down now. So we look to identify what you're averaging as far as monthly active users or concern. And then based on that would kind of represent your cap. So let's say you have 500 users that are active month to month, right? That are coming into the system consuming content, those licenses effectively reset at the end of each month, allowing new users to come in and take their place, that those other users are coming back to the system.\nNICHOLE’S: To their profile, correct?\nTREVOR: They could still have access to their profile. Yeah, exactly.\nNICHOLE’S: Okay. Got it.\nTREVOR: Yeah. So, is that, I figured that might be helpful call out to make sooner rather than later. Is that, was that helpful? Are there any questions about?\nNICHOLE’S: Yes, no, I think that's I mean, that's definitely where we want to?\nTREVOR: Yeah, because.\nNICHOLE’S: I do think it's rotational.\nTREVOR: Yeah. Now, are you offering, is all of the content that you're offering? Is it all free? Is it all paid? Is it a combination of the two?\nNICHOLE’S: It's a combination of most of it is free certification classes or what we're charging for. But again then, you know, as part of Growth to build a case to create some sort of have a revenue stream. So the free searches would be available either search to your customers. And if you're not in those tiers that you're going to be paying some sort of.\nTREVOR: Okay. So are you looking for a situation then where if you're associated with a specific partner, you would have access to that free content. But if I wanted to come in and maybe it was interested in of course kind of our cart, it's likely that our cart course would be a page for course. Is that kind of the general idea?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Trevor and Nichole discussed the exponential growth of their business, which has necessitated a need for automation. \n\n END"}
{"prompt":"NICHOLE’S: Yes. Okay. Is that they received certification courses because that's a national certification third party. We have, you know, their speed.\nTREVOR: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, that makes a lotta sense. The reason that I wanted to call that out is of course, you're going to be paying for the LMS and you're gonna be paying for, you know, how many users are coming through, right? So what's the charge back process? How are you going to make that profitable for yourself? Right? So your approach makes a ton of sense at the end of the day, you just kinda have to be careful in and around how you offer free content and who gets access to that free content, right? Because just don't bring it up to everyone, then you're paying and you're not necessarily guaranteed a payback. So your approach makes a lotta sense. I know that we're right at time. The last question that I have is just as far as timelines are concerned. Is there a particular go live date that you have in mind that's been discussed internally… to be up and running with the platform?\nNICHOLE’S: So, the goal is to incorporate this into 2023. The idea being that… kind have just recently kind of been given the thumbs up to get this is where we're in budget season now. So it's okay if we're going to ask for if you need to ask for it. So we're you know, really wanting to, you know, within the next week or so to have a proposal to… someone to say, okay, take the next step or?\nTREVOR: Okay. That makes a lotta sense. Okay. Well, I can help you there for sure. And then… my only other question just from, sorry, I said that I only had one question but I, in fact I had to.\nNICHOLE’S: That's fine.\nTREVOR: I don't I tried to do a little bit of research on line, but I'm very curious, just kinda understand your business and your relationship with Lowe's and specifically how purchasing is done with Lowe's Pro Supply versus just load the umbrella come. So, do you? Yeah.\nNICHOLE’S: Okay. So you have flows within the retail store, you upload pro, which is, you know, where that's within the retail model. Okay? In addition to that, you have Lowe's Pro Supply which is more the maintenance repair operation. So, the warehouses, you know, aren't at a retail store you'll want get applied stuff. Everything is the quarter delivery process. So for all under the Lowe's umbrella in terms of, you know, purchasing when you say… purchasing element?\nTREVOR: Yeah, I know.\nNICHOLE’S: That's true. Yeah, we still, we have to have it approved, the VP level and then it has to go through the procurement and the contract negotiations or procurement.\nTREVOR: And that's held at like the parent Lowe's company level. Is that correct? Or do you have independent purchasing rights as well as your own legal process?\nNICHOLE’S: Yeah, it's kind of a dotted line. Now, it's still gonna fall under gloves.\nTREVOR: Okay. Okay. And yeah, you had mentioned that they don't have an LMS in place. They have Workday but it's not really designed for.\nNICHOLE’S: It's it's they use it for the internal LMS but not, it's not for externally with our customers. It's just, it's the way that work day or?\nTREVOR: Yeah, yeah.\nNICHOLE’S: Already measures are we can't hit?\nANDREA: Yeah.\nTREVOR: Yeah. Yeah. No, exactly. We have a lot of clients that are using Workday for the internal population, but Workday can't support essentially two use cases. They can't support both the internal and external. So we have a lot of clients that are still with Workday for their internal, but then leverage our company to support their external partners and our clients. So, yeah, okay. All of this makes sense. Now, are you hoping to just get your hands on a proposal for now and then start kind of the evaluation process with demos and stuff like that some time into 2003 or are you looking to see presentations as well too and kind of start narrowing down your search to a degree?\nNICHOLE’S: I think a little bit of both. I think that, you know, as long as we're you know, like say the pricing modules. So the idea, so we say, okay, this, there's no way they're gonna agree to this or, yeah, they problem. I mean, like, you know, my senior VP is basically say, you know, if I've gotta go spend this money to support the Growth of this department, I'm gonna champion, I'm going to get behind it, but we're not going to be able to get to say, okay here's, your blank check.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nichole is looking to incorporate a Learning Management System into their business in 2023.\n• They will have to get approval from the VP level and go through procurement and contract negotiations with Lowe's Pro Supply.\n• Workday is used for internal purposes, but not externally with customers.\n• Nichole wants to receive a proposal as well as presentations so they can narrow down their search for an LMS system that fits within budget parameters set by senior leadership.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"TREVOR: Yeah, for sure. Okay?\nNICHOLE’S: That, that we've run into.\nTREVOR: Okay. Yeah. No, for sure. Well, here's what I would suggest. I would suggest that we book an hour. We take you through a very high level demo, will record that session and make that recording available after the fact. So should you want to show it to anyone you're VP, for example, and you can get some support and by in that way, but as well, what we'll do towards the end of that meeting is, will dedicate five, 10 minutes towards the end just to go through the cost and then we can make a determination from there as far as where we wanna take the conversation next, if applicable, does that.\nNICHOLE’S: That's great. Yeah, definitely.\nTREVOR: Okay. Well, I know that you're in the car. So what I'll do is.\nNICHOLE’S: Hello, Andrea said that, does she have access to my calendar? So.\nTREVOR: Okay, perfect.\nNICHOLE’S: I think that, I know I can't do much.\nTREVOR: Sure. Not a problem. Let me just see here.\nNICHOLE’S: Throw, throw out. What do you think? So? Possibilities, I think Tuesday, I'm pretty booked Tuesday, but OpenID.\nTREVOR: Sure.\nNICHOLE’S: Say Thursday, I think.\nTREVOR: Hi, Wednesday wins. Who, that would be right in the middle of two meetings. Well, Wednesday, I have three o'clock eastern, so that would be two PM central.\nANDREA: Doable. Yeah, I don't have my calendar. Yeah, I'm looking it up. I have to log out of the chain.\nTREVOR: Now… between now and when we meet next Wednesday, it sounds like next Wednesday as possible. Would you have any sort of data points that would suggest… how many monthly active users you'd be averaging at this point in time? And just given your Growth, we might be looking to create some sort of scalable model for you. But just to give me kind of an approximation, would you be able to kinda go back through some of the information that you might have on hand as far as attendances concern and be able to just yet and be able to determine roughly how many monthly users would need to?\nNICHOLE’S: I don't know if you can pull that up right now.\nANDREA: Yeah. Let me… in regards to your calendar, it looks like there's a new should be fine on Wednesday because you don't traveling to the 20 fourth. So, yeah, Friday should be fine. You said three?\nNICHOLE’S: Wednesday?\nANDREA: Wednesday?\nTREVOR: Wednesday at three o'clock eastern. So that would be too. Yeah.\nANDREA: To, to, yeah, it doesn't look like she's, it looks like we're both free.\nTREVOR: Okay. Excellent. We'll get that over to you. And then, yeah, if you're able too dig up the statistics in and around where it should be quoting you, that would be excellent at all. Have something prepared for that.\nANDREA: Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry you were looking for?\nTREVOR: Yeah. So.\nNICHOLE’S: I really like about the monthly flow that we're seeing what's the average?\nTREVOR: Yeah.\nNICHOLE’S: Monthly enrolled.\nANDREA: See. And of course, you don't close it. I was working on it now and I think I actually just closed this.\nTREVOR: Yeah, not a problem.\nNICHOLE’S: I mean, I'm gonna say we're in the ballpark of 500.\nANDREA: Yeah… five five, two, 600 a month… or no? Is it a month? Yes. Yeah.\nTREVOR: That makes a lotta sense. Yeah, if you're averaging 6,000 users to date annually just given how your training is offered a 500 probably makes quite a bit of sense. Yeah, it's going to be like it's going to be between 10 and 20 percent of your total number, which I think 500 more or less kinda comes out to 500 or a 1,000 probably be the two tiers that I would look at.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Trevor suggested booking an hour for a high level demo, and recording the session to make it available afterwards.\n• At the end of this meeting, Trevor will dedicate 5-10 minutes to discuss cost and determine where they should take the conversation next.\n• Andrea checked Nicole's calendar and found that Wednesday at 3 PM Eastern would be suitable for both parties.\n• Trevor asked about monthly active users so he can create a scalable model; Nicole estimated 500-1,000 users per month which is 10-20% of their total number\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"NICHOLE’S: Yeah, because like right now, I pay, it will slow down towards the end of the year. We'll be busy or other times a year, but I do think, yeah, yeah, we're looking for Growth next year. So, if we're already at 500, I think that we need to be, look at, you know, 500 plus.\nTREVOR: Yep. I can create to rate cards for you so that you have both 500 and a 1,000. Maybe you start at 500 and then you grow to a 1,000. So.\nANDREA: Yeah. And it looks about the lowest for the month and that's just because that was kind of a crazy month. Los is a little over about five, four or 450 highest being 850. Okay. Somewhere you repeat that number? Okay?\nNICHOLE’S: Those…\nTREVOR: Are pretty.\nNICHOLE’S: One of the things Trevor is that… what we also will need to know like what's the backup plan? Like what if we grow faster that we've and protective, we're going to grow, like how do we prove that without… you know, going back to the well for another, the door every two weeks and the poor buddy.\nTREVOR: Yeah. Yeah. That makes more sense. That makes sense. I guess my question to that would be if you're having more people passed through the, your training academy, I would assume that would probably result in more dollars and cents that's going to be charged back. It, would that be correct?\nNICHOLE’S: Shoot your years, probably not a whole lot right up for it.\nTREVOR: Okay. Yeah. I mean there's a couple of options there. What we could potentially look at is just almost creating like a ramp schedule for you that's kind of preplanned to a degree, basically builds in guide rails in and around supporting your Growth model. So that is a little bit of… how do I put it?\nNICHOLE’S: Okay.\nTREVOR: Yeah. That's the case that you just outlined. I mean, your business model. It's I don't wanna say it's unique, but it just requires some additional thought in around how to, in, around the kind of the pricing and what we make available there. So we can discuss that. Needless to say we'll be able to come up with a creative option that will work and not have you going back all the time asking for more money.\nNICHOLE’S: Well, and I think part of it is to that in the way that we're tracking information right now, we might show that we had 850 people participate and all of the classes that were offered that a lot, but I don't know what percentage of those people attended Portland, one class, so that one user, we can be training them multiple times and multiple classes.\nTREVOR: Yeah, it.\nNICHOLE’S: Only be one user in terms of the element.\nTREVOR: Yeah, exactly. I mean, if those statistics, if those data points that you're looking at don't show you unique users, that would be accessing training. My assumption there would be that perhaps you have repeat users inside of that given month, which wouldn't be added. We don't once a user has enrolled and taking a course inside of the LMS, they're active and can consume that unlimited amount of information over the course of that one last period. So.\nNICHOLE’S: And so we don't we haven't drilled down that far. So we don't really have.\nTREVOR: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing again to kinda keep in mind too is that, you know, if a lot of this is going to be vILT, so offer through teams are Zoom unless they actually physically open up that do more Microsoft teams link… they're not flipped, right? So, even if they are enrolled, it's only one. Yeah, you don't get charged for that. Yeah, essentially.\nANDREA: Okay. Okay.\nNICHOLE’S: Perfect. Sounds great.\nTREVOR: Yeah. Okay. Alright. Well, this is really helpful. Much appreciate it. I'll follow up with that calendar invite shortly. And, yeah, I'm looking forward to the presentation and continuing the conversation further next week.\nNICHOLE’S: Right. Thank you guys for your patients with me. Get on.\nTREVOR: Well, it's not a problem.\nNICHOLE’S: Hey.\nTREVOR: Not a problem.\nRYLEY: No problem.\nANDREA: Thank you.\nTREVOR: Hello?

{"prompt":"LOGAN: Yes, yes. We did. Hi, I'm trying to see if I can change my background a little bit still, not, so you can see better at all. Well as downloading. So, yeah. So I'm Logan renfroe, learning development manager for cec. I've been here for about six months and then because my colleague here, Jonah noble, she just joined our joined the team. She's actually the assistant director for cec university. So we're both new to cec. We are… work now… my screen. Well, we're it's we're kind have… it's like you see like the shadows. So yeah, this is Jonah right here. So cec is a construction company. We've been around for about 13 years now. So we build buildings from a commercial skyscrapers, to hotels, to schools, hospitals, that type of thing. And so we have a workforce of about a 1,000 people. 80 to 90 percent of those people are in the field. So which creates an interesting logistics challenge in terms of trying to do any kind of training, learning development. That type of thing. We are… this learning development initiative for cec is really kicked off. It's gone from one an employee now to six people or not. I should say five people in six months. So we are greatly committed to learning and development. And part of the strategy is to have an LMS. And so we are looking for something that has good tracking abilities that has… is easy to use. So that it's intuitive. I use, I, at a previous company, we were using Paycor and it was kind of… they used it with their HRS system and it really wasn't that good. We switched to pay calm. So that's what we use pay calm was okay. It was fine. I thought it really wasn't is very user friendly as it should be. So we're kind of looking for that. We're also looking for a content library. I know we've looked at different LMS is and we know their specific content library is out there like open sesame and LinkedIn learning, but we're just curious on what you have because we're looking really from our content is more constructions this specific. And so again, it's not like a marketing company doesn't have that because we're that's something that's like culture specific, but we would be interested in that. And then also your content creation tool… you know, content creation means a lot of things to different people and well, for a lot of people who do LMS is are people who think what are the elements should do is basically just load a video onto your LMS, and, or a powerpoint and knowledge check questions and that's content creation and not saying that's not content creation. But I know our company is a little bit more robust than that. So I just wanted to see kind of what y'all are what you all are. You know, I've watched them in your demo videos looks very impressive because that to me, I would like to have kind of all in one tool instead of getting a program like Articulate and which to me is also not user friendly. It's not intuitive. So anyway, so a lot, I hope that is helpful to you.\nSCOTT: Yeah, no, that's great. Logan sounds like, you know, exciting time to what's kinda like driving the shift in L and D, like how you go from zero to six and.\nLOGAN: Yeah, I think this has been a plan all along. They have started out before I got here. They have… individuals in Frederick is actually our boss. He's out on assignment right now, but he was but in the electrical field for, you know, 2025 years, and he really enjoys training people. And so he got involved like they made him the Dean of cec university is his title. And so he would just do a lot of internal training and just on just kind of have written, I wanna say random classes but it wasn't structured. And so they had decided that they wanted to go down the route of creating training profiles for essentially every job role. So they've started with two are most important roles, which is project manager and superintendent. And those two roles on each field project team. And they're the ones that are driving the projects and they're the ones with the project. The buck stops with the kind of an idea. And so they developed a list of classes essentially like 12 or superintendent 10 for project manager to different aspects of their jobs to help train them and make them better. And so it just kind of at that point is sort of dovetailed into a whole learning initiatives. So that an LMS, what's going to be a part of that because we want to be able to not only create our own videos, but we also want to have a content library where we can have people watch videos more than just construction from, you know, excel to leadership to whatever so that they can better themselves and what we're planning to attach that like you have to take so many courses. Are these courses to get promoted to another job?

Is that like an existing platform or is that just like a concept today?\nLOGAN: Hi, this is what we call ours. It's essentially the learning and development team. So, I think of it, we, I mean, we are trying to create a corporate university. So that is what we are trying to. So it will right now maybe sort of concept, but we're bringing structure to the training and learning function. So that is a fully functioning training university but not in the fact that certified by the education.\nSCOTT: Yeah.\nLOGAN: In house type university.\nSCOTT: Of course, the only reason I bring it up is it, it's pretty popular like you for our customers. They rename it to company name university companion academy.

This is like the company's first LMS but.\nLOGAN: Yeah, it is very ground floor.\nYULIYA: They're…\nLOGAN: Like reporting both the foundation for the concrete for the ground floor.\nYULIYA: Yeah.\nSCOTT: Yeah. Well, I think there's a few different ways to kind of take this. I mean, I think there's some conversations around skills around career path and how do we get the right content to the right people at the right time? Ultimately, we do have to really make sure we align with your strategy to. So you talked a little bit about kind of the renew focused on L and D. Obviously that's happening with you. What are your like top priorities? You mentioned a couple of those roles, couple of kind of like courses for them. Is it like onboarding you're focused on for those roles? Is it skill development is a trading folks on?\nLOGAN: It would really be more sort of skill development because we're like one of our courses is like how to do project cost projections so that people like it would we're going to roll it out for the project managers, they already know how to do it sort of, but we're each project team has their own way of doing projections. And so we're trying to say this is kind of a more uniform way of doing it. So it's not, I would say is developing a skill but it's not like they've never done projection before and their lives. So because these people are have per experience. So it's not like we're teaching them from scratch like so far.\nSCOTT: Okay.\nYULIYA: I'm pretty.\nLOGAN: Yeah. It's been brought up and it's right under that because we do a… soft onboarding now, you know, where you rank benefits and we have our safety manager, do couple of, they start training, you know, our hours. And then if there's specific topics Slack with computers, but we weren't meetings. So it's late last week that what's next? Nice. So the CEO, yeah, number the number. Yeah, Nick, our CEO is really wanting to enhance that onboard training to maybe do some actually hands on stuff with our new electrical people.\nYULIYA: Or talk more.\nLOGAN: About the environments that they could… see why they're working with us. That's one of the other big pillars for cec. Currently, it's infrastructure. And so we have big job up in Montana. And so that's another thing we have jobs across the country, Mexico my channel, they'll be switching and tracking their training and that kind of stuff. So onboarding is right behind the kind of it's not going down the track at the same time, maybe lagging a little bit sure.\nSCOTT: Right. I wanted to get a sense of kind of like audiences sort of mentioned like sounds like you're starting with the kind of initial initiative or project manager superintendent, but I was curious if there was an extended Audience beyond that, if it's all company or if it's different roles that are kinda going to come into play too.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Logan is creating a corporate university to bring structure to the learning and development team.\n• The goal of this training program is to develop specific skills, such as project cost projections.\n• Onboarding will also be enhanced with hands-on activities focused on introducing employees to their working environment.\n• Initially, the audience for this program includes project managers, superintendents and other company roles that may come into play later on.\n END"}
{"prompt":"LOGAN: Different roles will come into play. So, this is, this will need, you know, the people who are field staff are the ones going out to do the construction. They do not unless they're like a Foreman or kind of middle to a higher level in the hierarchy. They, the ones below that the helpers, the tradesman, they do not have company email addresses, so it's going to be important that they have that which I assume our company does. Giving your reputation has, you know, a robust app that can go on their phone, so they can do learning or if they need to log in from a computer home, but they, because they're in the field, they do not, they don't set it desks. So they don't have a computer. So, so that's another aspect of it.\nSCOTT: They considered your employees are like, are those sub contractors like external kind of?\nLOGAN: No, there, there are employees. They're seeing as employees. Okay, it's just how it is in the industry as a whole. Like if you're out in the field unless you're kind of in leadership in the field. No one really has a computer or… so different from being in the office.\nSCOTT: Yeah. Well, we've seen it all. You've got the shared iPad, you've got the mobile device is going to be the most popular. We do have a mobile app. We have a custom branded mobile app too. So we'll talk a little bit about that and the best ways to get engagement.\nYULIYA: Hey, did have a.\nSCOTT: Question to you. I'm not sure Jonah maybe heard you the background. Did you say, was there like different sub brands within the cec umbrella or that are maybe not hear that correctly?\nLOGAN: Two…\nSCOTT: Different.\nYULIYA: Infrastructure.\nSCOTT: Is it?\nLOGAN: Yeah, the infrastructure and the electrical or that she divisions that have never focusing on, we do have a smaller MVP mechanical?\nYULIYA: I cannot footprint.\nLOGAN: And then all the employees across the whole thing they want to eventually have it.\nYULIYA: For…\nLOGAN: You know, so… so they can see where they are, what's required now and then in the future, if you want to become this type employees, then what you need to do. So.\nSCOTT: But everything's under the CC brands. There's no like acquisitions you've had or anything like that.\nLOGAN: Right. Hi there. This is such a new thing. They're even talk to him today. They still.\nYULIYA: Really determine.\nLOGAN: If cec university will be its own entity within the group or if it's gonna be.\nYULIYA: Part…\nLOGAN: Of that company, we are first of January moved into a new building but HR results so though and stuff like that. So they're kicking off with that somebody's pocket. It's very infancy stages of building that we're like this. So.\nSCOTT: Okay, perfect. Well, thanks for sharing that. I just always like to make sure I got a good lay of the land and who are educating, you know, it helps us at the end of the day. I think we're probably gonna end up agreeing to go to a demo here. It just kinda helps us Shape and kind of give you more of an idea like what are these past gonna look like for different roles? Like just to kind of make it a little bit more real. One of the next questions was around content. So you kind of talked about content building, content creation, content libraries, sort of what's your plan with like I guess I'm assuming you're starting fresh or are you going to be creating a bunch of content?\nLOGAN: So we are doing, is going to start out pretty basic where it's like we have, we actually just created a video where it's a voice over and one of our trainers doing having a powerpoint and doing the training. That way. I think we'd like to just sort of the Power of our company in terms of the content creation side, because our needs maybe a little bit more basic. At least starting out. I don't know if it's going to ramp up, but I think at this point, is we're looking at LMS, is we're just trying to look at all possibilities at this point?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Logan discussed the need for a Learning Management System (LMS) to provide employees with access to learning resources, even when they are in the field and do not have company email addresses or computers.\n• Scott mentioned that mobile devices would be the most popular option, as their company has a custom branded mobile app.\n• Yuliya asked if there were any sub-brands within CEC's umbrella. Logan confirmed that there were divisions focusing on infrastructure, electrical and mechanical work but all of them fell under one brand name - CEC University.\n• The team discussed content creation - starting out basic with voice over training videos done by trainers using Powerpoint slides before potentially ramping up later on down the line depending on needs.\n END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT: Okay. Because I think, you know, there's typically like two sides to it. There's the, do you build it or do you buy it? We normally policy like a 60 40 split for most customers depending on industry for the build it. You know, you can absolutely start super simple. I mean, we've got a built in screen recorder. You can do tests, quizzes, assignments. Maybe you want demonstrated feedback, your powerpoints or quizzes, but we do, you might have seen on our website, there's something called Shape which you know, I think could be a good compliment for you because you talked a little bit about ease of use and having used Articulate before it doesn't really replace what Articulate does. I tend to see that use and we place for mom file is really good. Well for more like the longer form courses. What Shape does is it really helps you enhance microlearning. So if your focus is sort of on, you know, bite size chunks, ultimately, you tend to get better engagement with shorter courses for information. But it would turn sort of like, you know, if you've got a four page PDF, it could turn it into a video within a few minutes. You maybe make a couple of tweaks, and you've got this piece of content that's going to show really well, you know, within five, 10 minutes versus spending eight eight hours a week building of course in Articulate. So we may want to look at that. Is that sort of like are you thinking like there's going to be mentioned video content, powerpoint content? Like does that exist? Or are you going to be creating all of that?\nLOGAN: We're building it all. And actually, since you make mentioned micro learning that's what these videos. Are there micro learning because they're going to be three two five minute videos. And the idea is that they will be really more geared towards the field staff who just the ideas that we want to create a library or almost like a Google. This is like how do you do this? Or how do whatever. And so, and then they'll be a library of videos that people can watch that have three two five minutes. And they'll be both. Our trainer is bilingual in English and Spanish. And so they will be able too watch those videos depending on the language that they speak.\nSCOTT: Yeah, yep. So we can definitely talk a little bit about languages too and what sort of goes into this as well? Is that like conversation around like a pre-built library? So just so you know, from our side, we've got about 90,000 courses that we aggregate from about 200 different providers. So a little bit different than on LinkedIn learning or, you know, open sesame, you get a little bit more variety in terms of like if you search a topic, you might have the same course from six different folks and we help you sort of narrowed down like what's going to be the best, you know, style or maybe you like animated courses are interactive courses and you get to choose a lot of that too for most of those gaps where you're kinda looking for that library. Is it around compliance? Is that leadership? Like, what are kind of some of those topics you're thinking? We don't want to build it, but we'd love to just have a one click course to bring in.\nLOGAN: Sure. I mean, in some ways, I kinda say all the above, I mean we want to have it security, we want to have courses for hippa and other compliance courses that along that construction courses, leadership development. Part of the thing is like these training profiles that I was talking about for superintendents and P, a project manager that are starting out with the goal over really onto the next several years to build out a training profile literally for kind of each role. So it, it's daunting sounding, believe me, I know. But that's why we want to be able to have like other classes for accounting, other classes for like HR, like getting into those type of areas where we've seen some basic accounting and HR. I'm not that we're trying to make people accounts per SE, but, or like an accounting major in college, but still some of those pre canned videos that can help people enhance their skills.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott suggested a 60/40 split for customers, depending on industry and to start with the built-in screen recorder.\n• He also recommended Shape as a good compliment for ease of use, which helps enhance microlearning by turning four page PDFs into videos within minutes.\n• Logan mentioned that they will be building all their content from scratch and it will consist of three to five minute micro learning videos in both English and Spanish.\n• Scott offered 90,000 courses from 200 different providers as one click solutions for topics such as security compliance, leadership development, construction courses etc., along with accounting & HR classes to help people enhance their skills.\n• They want construction courses and leadership development.\n• They want hippa and other compliance courses END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT: Yeah. Okay. Because yeah, I mean there's some great ways to combine it to, you can even like bring in some of this preexisting content, maybe like work it into a course that you're building ultimately. Like the question for you is just like, you know, what needs to be cec specific. Obviously you have to build that, but I mean, I was just doing a quick search for like construction related courses, got 800 plus in that space, you know, fall protection and confined space is you'll be probably more of an expert that I have in the construction guide that space, but we've got a team here as well that would help curate that and talk about topics. But it could also be now cyber security. It could be maybe leadership development, managing teams, you know, the excel we'll have all of that. So it's really getting down worth like your strategy like how do you want to combine that with this or what you're creating? And then also thinking about like, do you want to bring these courses into some of like more like that formal plan? Or do you like the idea of like, hey, if somebody wants to come into our library and search for a course on excel one-on-one like do we want to have that course available for them?\nLOGAN: Right. Exactly. Yeah, yeah.\nYULIYA: Might be.\nLOGAN: Because at first it's like, okay… you have this sidebar, you can choose that as we get into it and get more with my, we want to narrow it and to get more specific.\nSCOTT: One other thing to consider. And again, you'll probably as you go through this and talk to a few different vendors kind of size like what are some differentiators? One really strong fit for our company. It's showing, you know, bringing up the right content to the right people. So based on route roles, the skill profiles, we can tide those to our courses so that like if it is more of a free choose course, maybe it's an option outside of their learning plan. You know, we can make sure it's stuff that's relevant to their role because it could be a little bit different for a project manager versus, you know, somebody that's just out in the field as a general labour. One other thing I wanted to talk to you about too especially when we think about differentiators is our company tends to be a form that's really high engagement even from, through mobile. And one way we do that is that we do combine like formal learning and informal now traditionally like probably through pay core as well. Like, you know, anything that's kinda tied to an HRS tends to be a little bit more performance here's. Your path, get an email, come in and view it versus some of the informal stuff is like how do we leverage your subject matter experts? You know, people that have been working with cec for a long time now or the easy ways for them to contribute, maybe documents or videos or maybe within their own team share something? Have you kind of thought about like the informal pop? There? Is that something you're open to kind of creating that like culture of learning?\nLOGAN: I guess, I mean that's kind of what we're in the middle of creating a culture warning that's kind of why these training profiles are sort of the foundation because that will still be Instructor led training. And so the LMS is going to be there to help support that vision and the culture that we're trying to create it's. Still, it, he said it really at the hybrid and kind of take that because we know that there's some that will need more hands on if you're…\nYULIYA: Looking at it like maybe.\nLOGAN: I'm just not blue print ratings and sets will not break them out.\nYULIYA: And that you…\nLOGAN: Have this stuff and then do assignments on, you know, where it's the way from the last test or whatever that you might have some initial step that…\nYULIYA: In person or… video or… you know, broadcast out to the different places. I don't know.\nSCOTT: Yeah. I bring it up just because obviously, you know, we, you may scale into something that's a little bit more on the informal side. We can start with more of a formal, but we see probably like a 50 to 60 percent increase engagement. When you start to leverage some of our channels for bit of knowledge management too, I could even just be like a operating procedure channels what we call them, but everything becomes searchable. You know, within the platform, it's tag and tag skills to it. It's all about how do we make it? You know, they know, I go to cec university when I have any question is kind of like the idea we're trying to create. So I ask you a ton of questions. I think there's a few other things we can talk about how you're measuring success, higher, deciding timelines, pricing, and then ultimately booking some time for a demo as well. Is there anything that's kind of top of mind or any other questions you want to sort of cover first?\nLOGAN: I guess.\nSCOTT: Does does…\nLOGAN: our company have a, this is not like, well, no, but there's that have a career path tool. I've been asked that by HR to ask that question.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Logan mentioned that Instructor led training will form part of their vision but they are looking at hybrid options too. \n• Logan says HR wants to know if there is a career path tool.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT: Yeah. So I'd say, you know, career patting tool. I mean, it could be different number his mind just like the offering, but I'd say we typically use what we call like learning plans to create sort of that pathway for somebody so that, you know, it could just be sequential. Maybe you want like one course a month to open up and they just continue to get a notification in progress along, you know, career path thing can get a little bit more complex because just because you complete a full learning plan, doesn't necessarily me get a promotion. There's other fact there's too. So that can be a good portion of it like the career learning path that's kinda how I would describe it. You can change roles that can change like the skill set, our company change what content you get, but there are use cases to where we might wanna tied to your HR system and pull up things like completions as well. If they're tying in like HR business metrics to promote from decisions. Are you guys using any sort of like I guess HRS first of all our performance management tools today?\nLOGAN: I was going to bring that up. So, yes, we actually are using pay calm or HRS system. So I don't know if… y'all can work together on that. Like we chose our company to linked together. And I understand pay calm can be not friendly, would try to go up outside their LMS trying to combine with other people. So.\nSCOTT: Yeah, no, we can. So I've had a few that have come from pay calm. We've got sort of like a low tech way to do it, which is just like a scheduled data export. our company can pick it up nightly and user permission from there. It's called the Automation app and then we can push data back as well. But I know, I think it is pay calm that as a little bit more, you know, try to keep things within the pay calm area. But there may be other things we want to do to. I know you mentioned, you know, he has some sort of like your external contractors. They don't have like a corporate email whereas that being held today. Like is that all on and take over?\nLOGAN: Does, no, they're all in pay calm. They are internal employees. So they're just not like in our office. So, yeah, I know they have, if they have to pay calm app. So they want to request, you know, time off for, you know, look at their benefits or whatever they do that all through the pay combat.\nSCOTT: Okay. Yeah. So all we would need to verify with you then it's just for like user provisioning is just making sure we can get a data export on a continual basis from pay calm because we can ingest that data. We have tons of flexibility in terms of mapping like your fields to our fields. And it's not really custom field is just naming it and deciding like what's coming over, but that's typically how we're doing users provisioning. And unless you're using any sort of like single sign onto that could be a great question that comes into play.\nLOGAN: Okay. Cool.\nSCOTT: So answer is, yes, I mean we've got tons of people on pay calm. It's just what's the best way to connect to them. It's usually Automation out, but we do have open API is to, but it tends to be the same result for a lot less work with the Automation now. Sure. But good question. And then just a quick time check with you. And I were going to be at the half hour here, probably running past five for you guys to… if you have five minutes to go over, I could share a couple of things with you. And just terms of like, you know, user experience, we'll book a full demo. But if you wanted to maybe preview, we can do that too. And outside of that, the conversation for just be around like timelines and price.\nLOGAN: Sure. Yeah. Go for it. We're free.\nSCOTT: Okay. When do you need a platform in place by? Like, is there I guess sort of timelines they've given to you or?\nLOGAN: Well, now, soon… yeah. Yeah. So we were, we had certain timeline plans but those have been moved up for us. So… sooner than later.\nSCOTT: Okay. So, is there like I guess, but the sooner, right? Is there like something like, hey, like we need to launch by January first or is that like we've got a new Cohort coming in November thirtieth, we need to be ready for.\nLOGAN: Well, so…\nSCOTT: We can, how soon as soon?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Logan mentioned that their company was using Paycom's HR system and asked if Scott's company could work with it.\n• They also discussed timelines - Logan needed a platform as soon as possible but did not have any specific deadlines yet.\n END"}
{"prompt":"LOGAN: So I'll explain kind of where we are. So we are, we've already viewed a few vendors and we're going to try to demo a few more vendors this week. We, we'd like to people to demo with you all this week. Joe and I are gonna narrowed down the list. And then we have a committee of people that are going to, we're going to schedule another vendor. I guess once they, for the finalists and with this committee, and then we'll make a recommendation to our owner of the company. And so as soon as he makes the yea or nay, decision within the next, you know, three weeks or so, then we're going to hit the ground running to get going as quickly as we can. So as soon as our internal, you know, processes for purchasing the contract, you know, all of that, you know, legal stuff is done then. So, so.\nSCOTT: It sounds like we're trying to move fairly quick there, which is good for me to know because we can can't keep up with you with that. We can absolutely do a full demo this week to the only thing to keep in mind. And just sort of like obviously, there's evaluation time. And then there's like your actual launch. Normally for most folks, I just tried to like set the expectation with you that, you know, from signature to launch, it's good to kind of set the expectation internally for 90 days. It can't be shorter. You know, if you wanted to get courses in there for project managers and have it ready next month, you could, but obviously we want to, you know, go through the process with you help build the university. Yeah, we do like soft launch testing which has the workflows. How do you want your Notifications to be? So just kind of keeping that in the back of your mind as well.\nLOGAN: Okay. There's…\nSCOTT: Flexibility, but it's good to set a strong expectations internally?\nLOGAN: No, that's helpful.\nSCOTT: So, yeah. So I pulled up an example that one here. Just touch on a couple of things I think, you know, in terms of the user experience, we try to keep things really user friendly. I didn't go through and brand this yet. But now that you've had a conversation, I've got some ideas around the different roles, but the tables super flexible and all of our customers, they look a little bit different when you get into the platform. So whether you want to focus on something be very simple and straightforward, you can get a little bit more creative to if maybe you want to have things like, you know, videos on your dashboard, or maybe you're highlighting an upcoming, you know, Webinar that you want folks to register for. These pages are all just drag and drop. You don't need any coding and you can create these really awesome user experiences and it may even grow over time. Like your first version may not be here. The last. I'm kinda curious like your user experience that you're looking to create. I'm just given the Audience. Obviously, we'll probably have to look more like the mobile experience versus the desktop but thoughts around like, you know, when somebody logs in, like what do you want them to see if you want them just to be, you know, dropped on like here's your main question you'd be working on or, you know, is it more about like exploring content that's relevant to me? What's kind of like your desired experience? You're thinking about?\nLOGAN: Say that again? I guess.\nYULIYA: Just like your…\nSCOTT: Desired experience, like somebody is out in the field, they open up their app. They're into cec university. Like what's the first thing like I should be doing? Is it like registering for something that appeals to me? Is it just, hey, I have this learning plan. Let me make sure I'm up to date what's kind of like your desired?\nLOGAN: Yeah, probably say… more than one learning plan but not anything. Yeah, sort of won't be assigned to them, I guess because these courses are what they're going to have to take like for the training profiles.\nSCOTT: Yeah. Okay. So we want to be a little bit more prescriptive in terms of making sure they're progressing through.\nLOGAN: Yeah, I'd say if you're talking about like window the screen comes up, your first thing kind of what's assigned to you, and then either on the side or how we're needs to look at the secondary would be like classes you just wanna take because you want to better yourself kind of. And I didn't know.\nYULIYA: Yeah.\nSCOTT: So, I'm actually gonna flip this over because as I'm showing this, I think it's probably best to show you the mobile experience first. Let me see. Sometimes it gives me a hard time to share from my phone here. Marrying… Unable to connect well. It's technology is always great. And so, that right?\nLOGAN: Needed…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Logan and Joe are narrowing down vendors to demo this week, with a committee making the final recommendation to the owner of the company.\n• Logan's desired user experience includes having multiple learning plans available when someone first logs in - some assigned and others self-selected by users who want additional training opportunities.\n END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT: There's no, but it'll just go through and it'll pick out what it's grabbing as like the most common topics if your documents super long, you know, there might be more of a chance that you want to add a slide or, you know, maybe remove one that is relevant. So, the nice thing is that does most of that work for you? You're not doing really any manual input. You're just kinda making a few tweaks at the end there… but I've got something for your website. I think that will kind of make it a little bit more, you know, obvious in terms of the user experience. So those are just a couple of things I wanted to show you. There's a lot more to explore admin managers, you know, some of the social features to gamification, but does that kind of bring up any questions or thinking about are kind of ways you're hoping to use an LMS that maybe you do want us to highlight on a brief demo?\nLOGAN: No, the kind of covers everything. I think also the content library. I know typically demos are about an hour. So I know this is an aggressive Magento. So what, whatever that if we could cover this because this point, we're just looking at the service level. So we're not necessarily thinking, you know, down into the weeds.\nSCOTT: Yeah, of course. And we can actually get into the library and then, you know, depending will book our next call now. But I mean we could even get you into the trial.

I'll get a hiccup froze on the screen there for a second, but… yeah. So tomorrow, I'm free any time after 10 a M, your time central?\nYULIYA: My God, let's see here. Okay. Wow.

{"prompt":"SCOTT: Yeah. So yeah, let's hold off to the demo because I think you'll see with the table that we're really scaleable.

So it's more about like fit and what's going to be the best, you know.\nLOGAN: Okay.\nSCOTT: I think we're good from there, so I'll try for tomorrow morning, but I appreciate your time today. If there's any other questions. I mean, definitely bring them up. Otherwise, I think I'm good.\nLOGAN: Okay. Well, thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah… yeah, thanks, Yuliya.\nSCOTT: Okay. Enjoy your night. I'll see what tomorrow.\nYULIYA: Thank you. Have a great.\nSCOTT: Evening.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Scott is going to follow up tomorrow morning.\n END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Hello?\nSUZAN: Hi. How are you?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Hi, I'm good, Suzan. How are you today?\nSUZAN: I'm good. Thank you. Thank you.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: How bad at all? Hey, Nancy. Good to see. Yeah.\nSUZAN: Okay.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Let's introduce both you to Christian. So you got two questions. Perhaps I can go by Chris if you want to call me out… but he's gonna be our technical experts, can be ranked the today's demonstration primarily from a kind of a functional capacity. And so he's gonna take the reins on this thing. For the most part. Cut them up on our first conversation is watch the discovery. So we're good to role. I do want to begin also by mentioning like the demonstration like 60 months ago. But if you do have any questions as we proceed throughout, the only thing I encourage is please ask questions, just interrupt Christian or myself depending on who's talking or on the opposite end. If you feel more comfortable, I don't want to disrupt this flow. Feel free to just something in the chat and I can answer it from there. So I mean, we wanna make this as interactive as possible at the end of the day. The presentation we set up for you is determined to generate ideas. So because you want to do things like create a learning culture, get people excited about learning, we have suggestions ideas for sure. But we want to bounce those suggestions and ideas off the culture that is Cora off which you are as an organization, your mission. So we kinda just want to show what's possible what you can do. But we want your input in your thoughts around everything as well today as well as an aside to I have Spence down just joining. He's just going to be a support person. He's our manager of solutions consultancy, Spence. If you want to quickly introduce yourself.\nSPENCE: Yeah. Hey, guys. Just here as a backup for anything that does that need to come in on. But I'm mostly be sitting in the background on that list and everybody else. So good to meet you.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Awesome. Thanks, Spence and Spence. This is Suzan Nancy from the HR and Ellen de, teams respectively. Cool. Awesome. So Christian, if you wanna go ahead and share your screen, we're just gonna jump right into things. And today, we're primarily going to be focusing on two main functions. The first is your learners experience, which is really the gonna be the bulk of today's presentation. Getting a good idea of what you can come to expect that they would have as an experience, the benefits that you're going to provide them as learners. And also we wanted to save a bit at the end for what your franchisees can come to expect. We know we want them engage in this process being a part of anything from user management to actually tracking training and all that kind of stuff. So we're going to show a bit about what they're experience would look like as well. But in the meantime, Christian, I'm gonna hand things over to you and then we'll go ahead and get started.\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Okay, great. Thank you, Christian and Nancy, Suzan, very nice to meet you guys. As Christian mentioned at the top of the call, feel free to jump in and stop me. You know, if you want clarification, have any kind of questions or just want me to dive into things a little bit further for you. But as you also mentioned, we're going to look things from a couple of different lenses. First one that we're going to dive into here is that from the perspective of the learner, so those folks that are coming in, taking training, I'm logging in at the beginning of their shift and kind of going through those three two five minute videos. I know that was important to you guys. So what we have here is the log in screen to the our company platform, a couple of different ways that our users can't access the learn LMS site. One is going to be kind of that traditional sign in gateway, enter in your user name, entering your password. Otherwise we can also handle a single sign on. And I'm not sure if you guys have any sort of those touch a requirements or if you guys leverage any kind of SSO tools currently. I'm sorry, what's that?\nSUZAN: We don't…\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Okay. So then the user experience would look something like this username log in entering into the site. Another thing we have support for. I believe it's up to 50 languages currently. So I know you guys are based in Canada, have some locations and come back and French might be important to you guys. So the platform is able to be natively translated into up to 40 languages. So we do have the ability to handle, you know, all the French speakers and so forth. So can dive right into the platform here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •They do not utilize any SSO tools.\n END"}
{"prompt":"SUZAN: Do you want me to go first monthly? Well, actually I liked the fact that you showed us one that's really busy and charges were either and another one that's similar. I think that like we met, you understood well, we want to start slow and progressive and we want them to because right now they, what they walk into an extra not only charge, right? So I don't mind if down the line, it ends up being a little bit busier. But I definitely would go with something like this one where it's simple intuitive and straight to the point. And then as I get some addicted then I'd say, hey know what? We just unlocked the new feature although I would known for a while it's there. Now you can do this night that depending also on the results on how they're evolving. If you know, if it's a little smaller or if there's a specific topic they're really into or somewhere in fact, the feedback we get if they're saying like it would be really cool. They will interact with other. It would have like a like what's the word I'm looking for others, the technical term like… what's the Cora forum, you know, like a Facebook or whatnot and we'll also go with it but I'd rather give less is more especially now that they're dizzy with what they have something that's so simple that so to the point that they're gonna say, yeah, it wasn't that hard. It wasn't like this big heavy think goal. You'll have fun with it. And then as time goes by, we can start popping things here and there, you know, adding a few things and new features and always making it look like there's something know even though we already know it exists. Then it's a feature that's available. It just keeps it moving forward. It keeps it fun. And yeah, definitely a chef something you're gonna see a shopping, the servers only going to see a server thing. I don't want them to be able to see each other stuff. Because if there's a, if there's a, I'd rather have a section that says, hey, this is how you would have room for advancement. But in the restaurant industry in front of the house backgrounds are usually very separate. So it's very rare that you'll have someone swat from one to the other. But if that were the case, then I could just create them a new path to give them access to their new path. So that's not something that worries me. You know, I also like the fact that the more busy or what it's going to be the same for head office, corporate members as well. We'd rather start easy. I just, I think it's human nature, right? You may want to start using what you play the game on your phone. You don't go with that straight away, right? To remediate and move on. I guess it would be the same for all members of the office. And I think that when they get addicted, we can just add them. They will feel like it's heavy. They're just gonna say there is going to be used to what they see. And then when they see that new feature or whatever way we find a cool way something flashing whatever the zoo I or my eyes already used all this. So it's just gonna go straight to the normal. Think I think simple is better to start because of our current circumstance.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: And you're actually pretty much right in line with our methodology towards training. We've we very much agree with that approach. We call a crawl walk, run, start off simple, get people acquainted, but get them involved and growing within the system. And so like Christian set up this landing page. It took me 10 minutes. I'll be, we do have experience with the platform is, what am I going back for a second? Christian? Before? Yep. Yep. What are the second one that's okay. Yep. Okay. So this one, for example, right? Because it is widget basis configuration, it's not coding although you can do it like tech talks, one of our customers. They did some crazy stuff. But if you want to do something like that is like comprehensive like you see in front of you or simple. And it's meant to evolve over time. That's kind of what we're about. So to add something like a new widget or a new feature, new content on the landing page will take you just like a minute. It's just a matter of a click and that's about it. But as that last example, what am I not going to the certifications? Christian? Yes, this landing page is really as simple as it gets, right? And this is just a third example of what you can do if you really want to keep a stripped down. So Christian, if you, what am I speaking to this?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Suzan wants to start with a simple approach and grow later.\n END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Yeah. So this is a perfect example. Like you said, something that strip down say for onboarding journey, some of this just brand new to the company, to the franchise, to the restaurant and they need to see what trainings are required of them. You know, right up front, they can see a simple view like this, what's not started, what have they taken? And what are the, in the progress I've taken? And then what has been completed. So you can kind of walkthrough that progression of training that is required of them. And then maybe they graduate to a page like the one that we just came from as they have gone through that?\nNANCY: Boarding?\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Process?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Yeah. And one thing our, some of our customers do that it's certainly a bit next level. But if you really wanna make this an exciting environment, we actually have the ability to change their landing page or the homepage based on completions. So it's a dynamic experience where you complete the simple part. Like I'm a new employee, Cora, this is my landing page. This is my first introduction to the learning system. I complete all my onboarding training. And then the next time I log in my homepage is actually the full chef experience, the full server experience, right? Because we're able to group based on completions. And as a result, that can lend to an automated switch of my landing page. So it's a really beautiful but dynamic way to evolve the experience as they complete content. Changing up. Things will help keep things fresh, an idea. But something that's possible.\nSPENCE: Well, let me just throw in on top of that. I think such a good point Christian, you could also before you even get to the point of completions, basing it on job title or any of the other fields that you have on them is the normal methods. So, right. They come in as chef, they haven't done, you know, whatever the five onboarding courses are. So they immediately get that simple dashboard. And then once they've completed those five, like Christian said, you move them to another. And then as you go through, right? You can create as many levels of that as you want in that same crawl walk run model.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Was there, was there a question there, Suzan?\nSUZAN: So when I finished watching some tickets in real time that it's swaps from let's say in progress or completed it's. Not. I have to log off and log back in or it's in real data in real time. Okay?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Okay.\nSUZAN: Okay. Thanks.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Problem. But yeah, just again generating ideas for what you can do and we could even like show you functionally how that would work on another call. But yes, let's talk about the actual training, Christian, if you wouldn't mind carrying on.\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Yeah. So I'm gonna jump right into.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Getting started of?\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Course. Yep. Sorry, went to the course and not the getting started. So just clicked into this is an example of a learning plan. So if you want to think of the learning plan like structured like a curriculum, right? So able to string together courses at that would be kind of like or intended to be taken together. So you can kind of start to think about how you would structure that learning for the end user to progress through a series of learning objects to complete one specific task. So this is an example of a learning plan. This, the users, the learning as well as Instructor led training or virtual Instructor led training. I don't know that the Instructor led piece would be important for your case necessarily. So we don't have to dive into that one today. But this is just an example of, you know, how we can piece together various different types of learning for your end users. As you can see down here, we have a little lock button. So we do have the ability to place a prerequisite score, structure courses in a way that they're meant to be taken together or in a progression. So you can kind of walk your users through that and make sure that they're taking things in sequential order or as well. You know, you can structure it to where they can kind have free, we all through that and be taken. Them are taking the different courses out of order as well?\nSUZAN: Hello? Hi, Christian. Yeah.\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Hello?\nSUZAN: I can split by memory. I can customize of course for the chat, fast forward, right? But can I customize of course where they can rewind if they miss something without having to re, listen to it and forward back to the two seconds that they missed. Yeah, okay.\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Yes, yes, I.\nSUZAN: Don't want them passport ink is, you know?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Suzan asked if she could customize courses so users have the ability to rewind without having to listen again from the beginning.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"SPENCE: Definitely. I think the best option for that is you can have them not able too fast for the first time. But after they complete it once they can fast forward underlined wherever they want to. So, yeah, that one will lock it down at least one time, you know, they didn't do anything and then they go to whatever they may have messed or whatever.\nSUZAN: Okay.\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Okay, great. I'm gonna jump right into the starting with the basics course here. This is an example of course structure. This has got all like the bells and whistles on it. Just use as an example to show you all the different types of content that you can be used to construct a course. What we consider ourselves as a content agnostic. And what that means is you can use a variety of different course content or different learning materials to structure a course together. And I know Suzan or Nancy, what are you guys mentioned on the last call? The ability to convert powerpoint slides or different documents and use them in here. We do have a powerpoint slide converter that is natively within the app here, and this will allow you to import your powerpoint files and it will automatically keep track of clicks. So if somebody leaves the course comes back into it, they will pick up right where they left off at. We have the ability to embed, you know, variety of different types of videos you to ask before you, ability to upload documents. So PDF files that are mentors, takeaways, as well as your traditional learning packages like tin cans and scorm files as well. We have the ability to include evaluations with a course. So… post course tests, surveys, assignments, submission. So the ability to record your screen, upload a video file, if somebody completing a specific type of task as well as the ability to use an observation checklist. So, Christian, if you want to kind of speak to the observation checklist, I know that this is important for our, has been an important thing for the food service model in the past. But the ability to include this checklist here?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: So, has Christians mentioning, and it's very common for our customers to have a checklist as a way to evaluate a certain competency within the restaurant, right? So let's use an example of somebody is clicking something and being able too checklist, if they've included certain ingredients or if, you know, there's a service like customer service interaction, let's say, did they say the right things that you would expect from your service people? No, do you have a similar type of evaluation within the restaurant? Or they can, how does that work for you?\nNANCY: Yeah, yeah.\nSUZAN: We, well, in our, all of our restaurants are supervised by a coach from head office. So both the coach and, or the franchisee can use. We have exactly that for all job posts, right? They already exist. So… they can evaluate their staff, our coaches can help the franchisee an evaluator staff. We have a variety of ways of doing that. Even some of the employees can evaluate themselves saying, okay, you know what? Let me check to the checklist that I say that, right? Suggestive selling tickets that I forget to just to seventh that I there's, the list goes on and on that I serve within the says status, that amount of seconds. Did I agree the customer at the right times? We have, we already have those. Yeah.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Noted. So there may be a case and this is definitely for something that you think about to potentially leverage the our company checklist as well. The reason being is because it will be in green with the rest of the learning structure that you have set up. So for example, these checklist can be attached to this attached from, of course. But the point here though is let's say this is an onboarding course where an individual's being evaluated for the ability to do a specific job, these checklist or both self observed or observe by another individual or both. So you can have your coach or manager have their own profile where they have a list of checklist that they have to run through and that they can complete it. Now. The point here though is that they will be part potentially part of course where you can have it lead to the completion of a course. So for example, maybe you want it, so of course, isn't you did until the checklist is completed to ensure that you got this piece and being well served or additionally to that as well, you can have it separate from a course. So people can just take it and be able to be able to track on it and report it at another time. So you're basically leveraging the our company observation checklist have the same functionality but you're leveraging it within the rest of your learning structure if you want it to work that way. So it's another additional option to think about if it's something you'd wanna use. And the reason why we like showing this to you because I think it does test testify to our like wants to listen to our customers suggestions. Hilton hotels is a customer of ours. This is something they asked for because it's something they do very similarly for their own staff when it comes to service interactions. So we built it for them. And much in the retail and service industries love something like this. So I thought maybe you'd be something we're showing?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Spence, Suzan and Christian discussed the basics of course structure and content agnosticism.\n END"}
{"prompt":"SUZAN: I'll give you a gift certificate to the movies or something, but the reality is just because I would like that doesn't mean that suits your needs. So seven people work all the time would love to have a Saturday off. So different differentiates, he's gonna, it's gonna force the franchisee to get to know the staff ask them what they want because not everybody wants a museum tickets, right? Some people just want to Saturday off. Some people would like a switch a schedule. So there's not always something physical but this allows you to personalize it and it gives us an opportunity to the French message explorer. These possibilities were a moment there's full swamped. They don't have time that their heart is in the right place. But the, you know, the first few letters and we just grab a gift certificate. Here is a prepaid. These are here's something and it doesn't necessarily appeal to the person in the whole aspect of, you know, what? There's actual tangible proof of how hard I've been working. You can see what I've been doing. So it also helps that the franchisee distinguish one employees to another because you can't always remember. But when you're when you want to actually see what's going on and get a real profile, you go on there and you see, my God, I hadn't realized how motivated this person is and what I'm looking for someone to manage my store or upgrade or offer bonuses, I actually have concrete information to help me do that. And at the same time, it gives you the employee's perspective that if they come and ask for a raise, for example, you know, they could say I haven't been doing everything that was requested of me. I feel I'm ready for the next steps, right? So it kinda shows both perspectives. I think it's a great. It's a great. It's a great.\nNANCY: Hello, is Derek company that presence? We are using this thing, you know, of reports and, you know, what they're giving me a certain things because sometimes it's tough to say that two different Tracy, you know, we'll probably have all the same kinds of requests but rewards, sorry, and, you know, what kinds of rewards really darn giving because that's tough fee with the franchisee. Can think a little bit differently than those are the one, you know, some people, some franchisee good. Thank you now. Yeah, but there are working and I'm giving you a paycheck… you know, already heard about these kinds of comments, you know, and just want to make sure you know, they're on board and they're on 2022.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: For sure. No, I hear your point there. And I love your, I love your comments to, about the fact that like, yeah, like there can be some creative control over this gamification, but it's always like I alluded too in the first call it like if you want learners engaged, you have to understand what learning means to them, right? And it's a very specific question because I see most, not most, I see like the other approach often that we're just gonna give them content. We're gonna give them these tools and they're going to do it and it's gonna work, right? But no, that's not always the case you can get and like have like a Ferrari but it doesn't mean they know how to drive it. You have to make sure that the change management is in there, but it's a very clear message of what you're trying to provide them, right? And to answer your question a bit better, Nancy and Spence, and Christian, you guys may have better answers for this than I do in terms of like common gamification rewards. We saw like the coffee with the manager, let's say is often used for that kind of cultural idea around learning. There are oftentimes physical rewards provided to you. But like Spence, I think he may work on the post sales side more than often than I do. Like what have you seen?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nancy and Christian discuss the importance of understanding what learning means to each employee in order for gamification to be effective.

{"prompt":"SPENCE: Yeah. I did a bunch with a full year as an SE for the account management team at the enterprise level and I saw, yeah, I think you nailed my favorite one which is an interaction with somebody else in the organization which costs nothing to deliver. But then encourage is both parties that is my favorite. But like you said, Suzan, not everybody has the same kind of idea of what they're gonna work for. I've seen like a company swag, right? As another really common one. But again, that's cool for some people, other people when they're off, they don't want to wear company swag. And so experiences and things like that might be really large amounts of points that can be like we had a president's club trip that we showed him the demos forever. And at some point we made one. So our top performers get to go on like a three or four day Mexico vacation or something which is huge motivation for everybody throughout the year. But the biggest thing I'll say is you can kind of see on the side here, there's a reward sets and you could say, you know, we are working with a franchise owner who has five stores and he wants to do something really special for his employees. We're going to make a set of rewards that only these people can see. And so you can actually have it be global whether say we do this for everybody. But if you have people who wanted to go the extra mile, you can make an Audience specific as well.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: At the end of the day, it's all about that culture of learning. Once you have a cultural shift, curious people and you have meaning towards their learning, then to start stuff's this begins to gain momentum, right? And unless there's any other questions you wanted to talk about the next big cultural kind of like push we typically do which is around the collaboration aspect of things.\nSUZAN: Yeah. I think just to add to that, I think the message, the reason why we're doing all this, the philosophy behind it shouldn't be well transferred to the franchisees. And when they start seeing numbers and they start seeing that it's a long-term investment and they're actually getting back from this and how they're getting back is going to be up to us to explain that to them. I think that's when people will appear and then want to pursue that aspect of it because they're not going to necessarily really feel that it's only about I'm pay they're working but I'm paying and above and beyond. I gotta give them breakfast that's because you didn't understand the concept of why, you know.\nNANCY: Sure it was Suzan, but sometimes, you know, it's difficult to say, hey, come on, you need to.\nSUZAN: Yeah. I think those franchisees are usually franchisees one number oriented. So when numbers don't line, right? So if you can, even maybe it's not within their own establishment. But maybe if we're able to get franchisees, we're really participative and without showing the restaurant showing how that increase their sales, how that increase their scores with aggregators online, how this increase customer experience when it comes to numbers. And then of course, there's going to be for sure percentage it just want nothing to do with it. That's the long, you know, nature's lot. But I think… some people will want nothing to do with this and that's normal we expected. But I think that it'll be a bottom delivery and about numbers essentially for the tougher ones for sure.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Totally totally. And we're gonna talk a bit about those numbers and a little bit. There's many ways to do it whether you're leveraging our company tools or not leveraging our company tools at the end of the day. I think your franchisees are going to care about learning data compared with performance and that's a conceptual conversation on its own. So I'm gonna make sure that like we parking lot that, but we certainly get to because it's extremely important. But we do want to touch on like when we're learning culture aspect before we move on beyond that. So go ahead Christian.\nCHRISTIAN WAMBACH: Yeah. No, that's perfect. Thanks, Christian. So we, what we have here is an example of a social learning page or dashboard, again, widget base configurable based on, you know, what your needs are. But this is just an example of the way you can structure a social learning environment for the end user. And what we have here are different channels. So these channels are going to be tagged by the AI and what the content that is included within those channels. So depending on what kinds of learning our, or what kind of learning assets are being uploaded to the system, they're going to be tagged and automatically categorized to different channels here. So we have the ability to serve up those learning or learning content to the users based on different segmentation, right? So whether that's going to be kind of like a back of house chefs, and then, you know, they would have content that is surface pretending to them or front of house et cetera. Yeah, the ability to kind of structure the content that way. Christian, did you want to elaborate further on that or do you want me to?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Suzan mentioned that franchisees may be more open to incentives if they can see the numbers associated with it, like increased sales or customer experience. \n END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Okay. We've you know, what I think we'll do is we'll record a video after the demonstration today and send that your way so you can get a good idea of what the mobile experience looks like before I do that. Though, let's finish off the conversation today, talking about your franchisees. Now, again, we want your franchisees to be involved in some capacity and it may be dependent on who they are, their personality, how they want to get involved, what they think is the right way to train. But at the end of the day, again, we're leveraging the platform to enable them with what they need to do if they want to get maximum only involved and to introduce the user type the Power user or what we call it is an individual within our company where you get to define the exact responsibilities and abilities they have within the platform over a specific Audience. So let's use the example. Again if I'm a franchisee and I have two stores that I have overseeing the Power over. Basically what we're gonna do here is we're going to give them specific abilities within the platform like let's say, being able to create a course or report on my two restaurants and also be able to manage the users within those two restaurants. So I can for example, remove a user, deactivate them when one of them quits, but I still keep your training records in case they come back or I add a new user that I recently hired so they can kind of manage their own little learning business within the Power user profile or their own log in while also doing any of their own training. Like do your franchisees have their own training to do as well? No, just not sure. Okay, gotcha.\nSUZAN: The only, the only training they have to do is well, they have to actually physically go into the kitchen, them, or a team member to show how things are done with all the tools and the processes come from head off, they do their own twist according to the reality of the restaurant. But essentially it's all.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Gotcha. Understood and is important for them to keep track of stuff like compliance training, like if you have like safety training or sexual harassment training and restaurant like are they accountable to those completions?\nSUZAN: Franchise? They should?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Be, they should be okay, and I guess it's more ad hock today. It sounds like a little bit more. Okay. Gotcha. So at the end of the day, if that's something that should be, we have to make it easy for them. So, without getting too much in depth, like there are reports, I'm assuming they all have court emails as well.\nSUZAN: They all have court. What do you mean?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: I can like an email from Cora like Cory, dot, almost call it.\nNANCY: No.\nSUZAN: No, they, they're not all as Chicago dotcom. No, no, they may have their own email.\nNANCY: Okay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Christian and Suzan discussed the involvement of franchisees in leveraging the platform. \n• Franchisees are responsible for physically demonstrating tools and processes in-store with a personal twist, but they also need to keep track of compliance training like safety and sexual harassment trainings. \n• All franchisees must have emails from Cora or their own email address.\n END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Cool. Yeah, no, we did throw a lot at you. So like I would love to pause there unless there's anything specific else you'd like to see. But no, today, we wanted to make about being conceptual, being around things that are possible because you mentioned on the call that you want to do it sometime next year with not a definite date and you want to do it right? And so doing it right is about exploring options in details and then choosing the ones that are best for your company culture, you know, like what did you think of today's? Presentation? Like did you see like some good ideas that you think could be leverage for that purpose?\nSUZAN: But I'll be honest, I, it wasn't a big shock for me because I had seen the previous presentation all those different. Yeah, I liked that. It's so simple. It's so simple. We have busy franchisees, we have busy employees and we want to create a buzz when they're already overwhelmed. So I liked the fact that simple, it's intuitive. It doesn't look complicated. It looks well thought out like the search bar is a weakness on our end. So I think hi, this is something that the filtering, just the filtering is amazing because we have so many tools that that's definitely something that I'm glad you guys elaborate on. I'm a little surprised because I haven't see that anywhere else to be honest, maybe they did, but they never highlighted it and that's a very good feature because we have a lot of things. And when you spend too much time looking for something, you give up just a few seconds and that's what we're trying to avoid, right? We're trying to avoid them giving up a quote and quickly. So, no, I liked what I saw. It was very nice.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Thank you, sir. I appreciate that, Suzan, Nancy thoughts.\nNANCY: Difficult to say at this point, you know, we found a couple of times and I think from a bit different but not blocked in a certain way. I know that Suzan really appreciate just here's the search way concerning game. I was thinking it was more, you know, from a list. Something fun to do. This is something that, you know, I didn't really see about it. And in the same time, you know, that will be a little bit completely different for our employees Indiana office general because there for Deanna, office will be more, you know, present some presentations from outside the ap of the e-learning something that we didn't create. And I'm pretty sure, you know, you have a lot of things that we can probably by or you already have in that in the.\nSUZAN: In your catalog?\nNANCY: Yeah.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Yeah, yeah, indeed. Like there's a ton of content there, I'm like and I think when you're referring to the Nancy, like are you talking on a content level? Like being able to interact with content itself?\nNANCY: Yeah, why not?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Okay. Got. Well. So, yeah, no, totally understand what you're going there. Like there's a whole conversation around like actual content type. So our company for example, can play what we call scoring packages or X API packages. Those are the pieces of content that you may create, which may be more in line with what you're speaking to. But I know on the previous call that we had Suzan that you mentioned that like those kinds of like extra curricular contact creations and not something you're really looking to do but that's a, no, I think that's a conversation we can get more in depth into on a future call with our whole content library, like really digging into that, seeing what's there to kind of really get a good understanding of kind of the off the shelf offerings and how that could potentially be added into the overall stack you're looking to provide. But no, I appreciate the feedback Nancy in terms of like the fun parts of the platform. I think the social learning is something that still has a lot of potential but again, maybe something more in depth customized to the direction we want to bring things. Okay. Awesome. So in terms of next steps, I know you got some considerations to think about when it comes to various other platforms and whatnot, and you're taking your time with it. Like how do you see next steps moving forward from here?\nNANCY: Difficult to say presumably we need to put together it's Suzan to make sure, you know, where we will present maybe a couple of solutions to the next level three high management and, but we need to make sure to get their hands on having time to get there just to look at them one after the other, just to make sure you know, that we are taking the right decision. And for that, and we'll appreciate, you know, if you can send us in a presentation or something, you know, that can help us to take a good decision. And after, will present to the I management. And after, you know, work with see, you know, when it will be just fine exactly.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Suzan was pleased by the presentation as it was simple, intuitive and well thought out. She liked how there were different filters available which would make finding what they needed easier. \n• Nancy had some thoughts on content creation that could be done outside of e-learning or creating something fun from a list rather than just searching through a search bar. \n• The next steps involve putting together solutions to present to higher management in order to take the right decision before working with Christian's team again when ready\n END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Okay. Yeah, sure thing. So, it's kind of up in the air right now.\nNANCY: Yeah.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Okay. Understood, do you feel like based on that, you have enough to go forward to present that up top or do you feel like you're still missing some pieces that would be important?\nNANCY: Do you think Suzan, do you miss something?\nSUZAN: We, we got the pricing aspect, right? That is definitely something that management is gonna wanna see. I think with this presentation and I think we're good. Yeah, not shy. So if I have questions will definitely come back, I'll shoot you a quick email if I notice that there's something missing, but no, I think.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO: Okay, awesome.

{"prompt":"SCOTT: Absolutely. So team kinda jump back into that learning plan. Again, totally support the blended learning approach. If you have some e-learning where people are going to look at some content on demand that's what our e-learning player supports. Very much you too like experience here. Where on those center left section, you've got the player. And on the right hand column, you've got the playlist. So the playlist can always be hidden. If the learner wants to maximize their screen, real estate, maybe they're on the mobile lap, maybe they're on a tablet. They don't want to see a playlist. They just wanna see all the content full screen. They can always pop that back open. I actually created a couple of modules here and loaded them with different formats just to get you thinking. So whether you have powerpoints, flat files, PDF, stocks. When you bring those into our company, e-learning course shell, you'll get a nice click through format. So the learner will have a very intuitive experience as they're working through this content. They need to say, see slide. They simply can click next. When they're done with the powerpoint, they can go to the YouTube link out. So they can just watch that video just to link out to you to when they're done with that. They can move forward with the MP four. So if you have any video content, an MP four, you can bring that in, serve it up right next to your other content like I'm showing here, and you can even lock that play head down, ensuring that learners are not able to buffer for the first time they visit the course. So nice feature there. But team when we jumped to module to you're, gonna see a bit more of authored content represented here. So whether this is content that you've created user using and all three tool where you have a scorm zip package as your output, you can bring that package in to the shell it plays again are right next to everything else. So the learner experience is extremely straightforward. And in this example, so I'm just working through a scorm course built in rise. I can also open X API. If you have those formats now, team, what you're looking at is not a new window or a new tab in the browser. This is simply screen overlay. You are still in the course, you just have an overlay. So there's no issue that we hear from other from come from customers that have worked with other vendors where they sell it, popped up a new window or a new tab. And our learners got lost all the time. Well, that's not the case and our company, no new windows or tabs. This is simply an overlay. I'm still in the course. I can just add that's in the course and go right to the I frame object that was very next in line here. So… team quick pause there. Do love to get any feedback on the learner E learning experience here with our course, our core shell.\nLAUREN: Yeah, this looks great. I actually have a question about the larger blended learning any might have it in somewhere in here. But as part of this blended learning, are we able too embed registration for Instructor led training? So I do my e-learnings imagine one module to maybe have to read a document and then I can register for class. Can we do that as well?\nSCOTT: Yeah, 100 percent. And it's really up to how you want that experience to go. It sounds to me like your learners will be self enrolling into different sessions… that's certainly support it. And I'll show you what that experience can look like. Learners can also for Instructor led events, as you mentioned, they can be presenter role. So you have options there. Give me two minutes and we will get there and show you the experience.\nLAUREN: Thank you, you're…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Lauren asked if registration for Instructor led training could also be embedded into this blended learning approach; Scott confirmed that self enrollment is supported and showed what this experience would look like.\n END"}
{"prompt":"TREVOR: Yeah, yeah, no team. I was just gonna jump in really quick and mentioned that everything that we've seen so far just as far as kind have accessing the content. We do have our own mobile app. So, you know, if a good portion of your learners are going to be looking to access training via mobile application that's certainly something that we support. Also want to call out as well to just as far as notifying learners that they've been enrolled into, of course, where that, you know, of course, is coming do or that they're overdue you. Of course, we do have a very robust notification engine. But one of the biggest call out that I wanted to make was the fact that we do have integration with Slack just as an additional means of notifying those users again native built out. So I wanted to make that quick call out as well.\nSCOTT: Yeah, great. Call out Notifications go out three ways In-app which we just looked at email most common and Slack. So it's an event driven notification engine. So it has over 93 events, things like enrolled into a course, your certification expires… your I LT session has been cancelled. All of these are just simple examples of events that can drive Notifications. Alright team. We have covered more of the traditional way as I mentioned, a couple of things to call out here. Our AI powered global search is fantastic for the learner experience because learners can come up to…\nCHELSEY: Top.\nSCOTT: Bar and search for any thing, right? And when they search their results already are bucketed into the category where that topic was discussed and you'll notice that it's a deep search. It's not just searching course title and course description. It's an AI powered search. So any content that you use in our company, whether it's one of your MP four videos or scorm package, anything that you upload and using courses is auto transcribed and auto tagged by the system. So that really empowers this entire AI powered search. You'll notice I search for our company and I'm pulling a lot of content with our company in the title. That is absolutely true. As I go down to the bottom set, you're gonna start to see content that got pulled in that does not have the table in the title. Really just driving home that point where our company, it was mentioned somewhere in this content, not in the title or description, but somewhere in the scorn package that goes down to speech recognition in every MP for video too. So that's all transcribed and tax.\nLAUREN: Yeah. Can I ask a question on that? Do we have the ability to restrict how far it goes down? Because my concern is if we have a large amount of content, say we said borrow is a search term borrows every single one of our courses so our learners would be inundated and they wouldn't necessarily bandwidth they needed. No. So, is there a way we can restrict that? And I search?\nSCOTT: Under percent. So as I mentioned, everything's auto tagged. You have the ability actually I should say your admin team. So who's ever your admin? It's it sounds like was maybe Casey, maybe KC and her team would have the ability to edit, revise and modify all tagging. So you'll be able to really dial that in.\nLAUREN: Thank you, you're…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Lauren asked if they can have the ability to restrict the search for content so learners aren't inundated.

{"prompt":"Jag: \"Give me one second right here. So now, anything from what I've heard of moodle from our clients is, you know, the ux UI is a bit cumbersome personalization kinda really takes a hit especially because you're doing external training things like that. Is that what you're experiencing too as well? Or what are you guys saying?\"\nBryce: \"You know, the comparison regular modal to modal workplace is a big difference. The UI is much better in workplace customization. Not so much, you know, there's some different reporting that can be better that's a big part of what we do. And sometimes we have to get like custom reports built. And that's like a whole support thing depending on what reports like it has a great report builder kind of, I guess I should say it's an okay report builder. And then, you know, we do a lot of custom stuff. So, you know, again before the UI was pretty terrible, it's gotten a little bit better but I think we're gonna see. I guess I'd like to see what else is out there.\"\nJag: \"Absolutely. And that's a key thing you also mentioned there Bryce was, you know, it was custom, right? Custom. What we see with a lot of like beginner LMS is, hey, it doesn't exist yet but we can customize it for you and we can put it in there. And usually there's fees and stuff like that. With Docebo. It's not about customization. It's about configurability. So we have all the tools for you to create what you want to create a, we just need to figure out how to create it basically because Docebo can use, we use for different audiences, different industries. I do have one built out here already for you. So it's a kind of a similar use case. So lift one we're working with right now, they wanted to see a platform where they can externally train people on their forklifts and things like that. So they have large clients, but at the same time, you know, they wanna use it for partner training as well to enable their partners as well. So this is their front facing catalog. This is how they wanted it done. It's fully custom. Like you can configure this to be whatever you want it. So just to give you an example, tick tack also uses us for their external training. And so does Amazon and Zoom and this is what theirs looks like. Give me one second here. Let me pull it up. So as you can see, theirs looks very different. So it really depends on what your look and feel is… for your kind of use case, your experience that you want to deliver to your clients, things like that, but let's get back to that one example. So as you're global, do you have a need for different languages that your learners might need to navigate the platform in anything like that?\"\nBryce: \"Yeah. Yeah. Global. I mean, Spanish is a big one for us, but there is, yeah, probably global like our current ones setup where you can do similar stuff, have different.\"\nJag: \"Fantastic. And, you know, it, should you have different courses on this front facing page, you can all have it available here. You'll also see AI at play as here as well. So, hey, based on the learners footprint, what else are they interested in? And what else can we bring up forward for them, right? Bring you more revenue for your courses as well? And then have you thought about how you wanna do subscriptions or payments? Do you do one off? Do you do subscriptions? What do you do?\"\nBryce: \"Yeah. We have definitely subscriptions, several different kinds, annual subscription. We've been doing for a lot of years. We have a monthly subscription. Now, we have pay as you go. We have big premium programs as we call them. So we have a subscription and like individual courses. But then we also have our premium programs that's more of like, you know, they're a couple of 1,000 dollars. So we offer like pay as you go. Yeah, I can.\"\nJag: \"So absolutely, you could do both with that. So for example, you can have monthly, you can have one off, you can do subscriptions, you can do coupons, whatever have you. And it's all consolidated in one experience for your learner at the same time. If you want to bring in web pages from your website, things like that, you can bring that in to have it all in one place. So I'm gonna log in here. Now, one of the things you're gonna see when I register your, you know, say someone comes by and they want to do some training for you can have, you know, their standard file a form. But we have something called additional fields as well. So if you have requirements of, hey, how large is your company? It's 50 to 100. Okay. And how many sellers do you have? Whatever have you and how you want to segment the experiences based on what they fill out when they log into the system, maybe company a based on what they filled out, see something different from company B because that is what's more engaging for company a. So you can start really structuring all of that. Can you do that with mode right now? I'm curious.\"\nBryce: \"So, yes, mode workplace specifically has different tenants they call. Okay? So basically, we set up different tenants for we have probably 20 or 20. So right now, so they actually have their own log in page though. Okay. And then they get directed and they see something different. It's not really customizable other than colors and names and things like.\"\nJag: \"Okay.\"\nBryce: \"But it sounds like this, there's one log in page, but if we had additional fields, it could be like maybe like a drop down like choose your company, and then that would be all customized to that.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jag and Bryce discussed the differences between Moodle and Modal Workplace in terms of UI/UX, personalization, reporting capabilities, customization options, etc.\n• Jag explained how Docebo offers configurability instead of customization for different audiences and industries.\n• They also discussed the need for global language support as well as payment options such as one-off payments or subscriptions.\n• Lastly they talked about setting up tenants with their own log-in page which could be further customized by adding additional fields like a drop down to select company names.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"DAVID\nOkay. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Just to just some introductions. I know you're very familiar with video myself. You may remember John hill from long time ago. We want to bring him from more historical context, but Ethan, John, I don't know if you wanna just quick low, quick introduction. I appreciate it just for Jessica devices we…\nETHAN\nSure. Hi, everyone.\nETHAN\nJessica, is my name's? Ethan, I'm the solution architecture that's gonna be helping with moving forward on the solution you were envisioning for Docebo and these new pieces you wanted to add being health stream and silent.\nJONATHAN\nAnd hey, Ryan has mentioned, I know we've met previously and Tobias and I have seen each other a few times since then, but solution architect and here to support Ethan and the team throughout the conversation\nDAVID\nThank you. Thank you both and Tobias, Jessica, if you don't mind as well, just some introductions and to just for Ethan awareness, I appreciate it.\nJESSICA\nSure. Jessica McLean, I'm the manager of digital learning products for two more days… manager under Tobias leadership team.\nTOBIAS\nYeah, like today, all of a sudden started now, feeling very well. I think that has something to do with it. But anyway, I am Tobias Washington and I have the pleasure of supporting folks like Jessica who lead a lot of our digital products across our HR function at Christmas.\nDAVID\nThank you. And just to like for the Agenda for today, there are a few things we wanna kinda go over.\nDAVID\nSo we want to… discuss the DLA integration, the health stream integration. We have Ethan and Jonathan on the call to validate that, make sure we have this will definitely work moving forward which are very confident is, and then will this will allow us to kinda go back internally with this amount of work, understanding how many recipes, the amount of work we need on our Professional search side to kind of give you accurate pricing?\nOnboarding\nDAVID\nWhich again not to jump too far ahead comment I made on our last conversation depend in on what we move forward and not move forward with, you know, we could always talk through the pricing more detail, but that's like the first step just to kinda make sure we have an sow in hand.\nDAVID\nSo that's one part of the conversation for today. The other part of the conversation stepping from our last meeting was just to take a look at our central repository and a little bit more of a deeper lens, not to say this Alan would our solution would replace it right away, but just something to consider, you know, just for future awareness.\nDAVID\nSo you have a better understanding of what our central repository solution could do. And then thirdly like to just kinda go through the technical account manager conversation a little bit more bio know we could talk through that in additional detail, answer any questions you may have. And so forth. Now, with all that being said, I want to be respectful of like the highest priority items. And I figured maybe we'll just kinda go in the order of what I just discussed. But if you prefer talking about something sooner, like for example, you wanna talk about the technical account manager first or if you want to go through the central repository overview first, whatever you prefer, or perhaps there's something completely outside of that Agenda I mentioned you'd rather discuss, but if it's okay with the team, we'll kinda go in that order, but I'll just pause for a moment. Tobias, Jessica, I'll defer to you if that sounds good in terms of that order. What was the?\nTOBIAS\nI let me just say this.\nDAVID\nNo, I don't fall.\nETHAN\nSo…\nTOBIAS\nI think central repository is a good topic but perhaps maybe not the most urgent right now. Okay. No problem. I know I need to just think about how we're supporting this given that Jessica is on the last couple of days, right?\nTOBIAS\nOur team, and we do need to really talk about and get that contract finalized for how we're bringing those other products into the table. So that would be my…\nDAVID\nYeah, certainly, I think so if that's the case, we'll remove that conversation. We'll table that central repository conversation just so we could have a good focus on the contractual stuff. I recommend. Let's just while we have Ethan and John on the call, I recommend because we know you're going to need this one way or the other that connection with health stream line. Let's first talk about that and just make sure we has all that out talk through that validate that. And then we could talk through like some of the contractual stuff. So, but that being said, maybe we'll start with, I think health stream would probably be a deeper conversation. So let's get the hard stuff the way first and foremost. So… let's talk health stream. But it, Ethan, John, if you disagree with that, please let me know. But I think we should just, you know, work on validating the health stream connection first. So I maybe Ethan, I'll maybe pass it to you and I don't know if there's just got maybe just start some questions on this in terms of like what we're trying to accomplish here. However you want to kinda navigate that conversation and just to kinda make sure you get the information you need in terms of what the team is trying to accomplish again with that integration. So I'll defer to you and how you want to handle that.\nETHAN\nSure that works and we can go ahead and get started with I'll be recapping what I've brought forward from the previous call.\nETHAN\nI did watch the recording so that we can avoid as much repetition from your end as possible… with health stream. The first thing I recall is that you said you wanted Docebo to be the source of truth. So we're syncing data from Docebo to health stream. Is that completion data? So certain courses being complete or what kinds of data are we syncing and communicate with health?\nJESSICA\nYeah. So where we want Docebo to be the source of truth is one for the users. So we want, you know, when a user is created in Docebo for that to pass to that health stream three PL connect site and create on their side so that they stay and sync. But then also when a completion happens in hell stream on that to pass back to do. So Docebo is where all of the transcript data lives.\nETHAN\nOkay. So it's bidirectional. They will be invited to each other users. So the user ID and Docebo will essentially the user ID health Tray. And then when you have a completion on the health stream side, you would like that to be registered in the.\nJESSICA\nAnd it should be because all of the, all of the content that will be launching into the site is all aicc. So that completion should automatically be coming back to Docebo via that package.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jessica is the manager of digital learning products for Two More Days under Tobias' leadership team. Tobias supports those who lead digital products across HR. \n• It was decided that validating Health Stream connection should be discussed first in order to determine what data will be synced between Docebo and Health Stream - bidirectional user ID sync as well as completion data being passed back via AICC package when completed on the health stream side.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"KEVIN\nHey, Kevin. Hey, Anna… I'm either gonna turn it over to you. I'm gonna keep my camera off. I'm not sure… that's fine. Okay. I'll do that in case I need to.\nZRAN\nHello?\nKEVIN\nHi, how are you today?\nZRAN\nI'm good. How are you guys doing?\nKEVIN\nDoing well. Thanks for asking. I'll assume via here with the WB team today?\nZRAN\nYes, sir. I am.\nKEVIN\nAwesome. While we're waiting for everybody to join, I was curious, is this for like everybody under the Warner brothers umbrella?\nZRAN\nHello? So.\nKEVIN\nOr a specific business unit?\nZRAN\nSo, Anthony and I work for one-on-one media global security, which is now is responsible for security for all of Warner media all over the world. So that might include England and kind of the, in other places, you know, where every time it replaces their security… and it might be used by the whole company. I know that they're looking at a few other, you know, options as well. Let's safety also uses it for it to work for us with our production. So that might be used as well. Once we are, you know, choose which are, which one we want, you know, they may join and say, yeah, we want to use it.\nLILIT\nNot…\nKEVIN\nOkay. So today, we're going to have representatives from the security team, but in the future, it may spread to more of the business units.\nZRAN\nLiterally cannot. So I didn't know limited. We invite somebody from safety's whether it's with Anna yesterday.\nLILIT\nToday.\nZRAN\nOkay. Let me see if Anthony is… is joining us okay?\nLILIT\nAnd…\nLILIT\nHello? Hi, Kevin. Hi, Anna. Nice to see.\nKEVIN\nHello. Good to see you again.\nZRAN\nYeah. So as I said, I represent the… the… what I mean, the global security and I don't know again, the lead can maybe answer, but to answer that is… is safety looking at the system as well, it or it. They already made… made their.\nLILIT\nI'm not sure, but of course, we'd be happy to share any information we learned today with that as well. Yeah.\nZRAN\nOkay. Any may be my guess is once again we will, you know, Anthony and I will choose the, our top three and kind have recommended to our VP and maybe she'll want again to set up a meeting with, you know, you guys or whoever we're gonna select, you know, the top three to kinda like ask more questions and all that stuff, you know. But yeah, it shouldn't… it shouldn't be a long process. We're kind of at the end of it and we need to choose a system so we can start using it. So we are hoping, you know, by the end of the month kind have like recommend the three top picks that we have, and then kind of start pushing it forward and clearly ties to clear. Once we say to go, it has to clear, you know, legal and all the, you know, the good stuff. But hopefully that's gonna take, you know, too long.\nKEVIN\nHello. Yeah. And I, yeah, when you say the end of the month, you mean five days from now or are you mean the end of November?\nZRAN\nThe end of October? Yeah.\nKEVIN\nNo. Alright. Well, this is the first time we've kind of done this. So… I…\nZRAN\nYou're kind of coming into innovate. So you're benefiting from, you don't have to wait long, you know, either way with that.\nKEVIN\nWell, I, and you've probably seen some other vendors throughout this process. So as we go through the demo today, if there's very specific functions that you've seen in some of these other providers and you wanna make sure that we have, it certainly feel free to call those out with only a few days left in the evaluation, we wanna make sure that we can, you know, provide you as much information as possible with these next few days, so.\nZRAN\nWould that be just… just literally sent you our requirement, right? So that's why I was kind of like, you know, the baseline, yeah.\nKEVIN\nFor sure. And so we're definitely gonna cover these things today. These things kind of in my opinion for the most part are going to be things you're gonna see in any LMS. What we wanna do today is show you a little bit more about kind of what… what makes Docebo a little bit different. One thing is that I didn't last little at this but about the business units question. So we didn't know this was specific to security. So you'll see today how you can kind of brand the platform if safety or other organizations under the WB umbrella decide they want to use the platform. We can definitely accommodate that as well. Real quick. We'll just introduce the team. My name is Kevin to Castro. I'm an account executive here with Docebo. I'll be your main point of contact as you have questions over the next few days, certainly feel free to reach out. I'll be happy to help brought along my partner Scott peacock today, part of our solutions engineering team, Scott, if you want to introduce yourself.\nSCOTT\nHey, everybody. Yeah, I'm Scott feedback. I'm a solutions consultant here at table which means I've convinced Kevin in a team that I know what the software does, but beyond that, I'm typically helpful when we think about how we set up things like integrations, how Docebo, you know, pull data in and can change people's, experiences based on that. And then I also work with our customers is.\nLILIT\nAs our…\nSCOTT\nProspects. So I'm on both sides of the fence and hopefully I can add some value for best practice.\nKEVIN\nInstructor. Perfect. Thanks, Scott. And then Anna as part of our business development team, I think she's gonna kinda sit in the back today. For the most part. Scott and I will kind of lead the conversation if there's any other use cases that you can think of to as we're going through this. Let us know. Is most of the training that you all are providing from your perspective? Is it all compliance required training? Do you have optional training? And what would that look like?\nZRAN\nBoth, we have compliance training and again compliance might be, you know, in… in ark and again Act-On who joined us sits in Atlanta. I sit in Los Angeles and… and we may have other partners in the future. This is in other locations. And, you know, we have different requirement for every sometime state. So some of it might be compliance. Some of it might be a company required training and some of it might be like optional, you know, four or I don't know required for supervisor only or, you know, certain, you know, section within the security department we have, we are pretty big department and growing and there is more and more section within that. And if we use it there's a good chance that again Anthony is gonna run, he's… he's going to be administrator for his part. I'm going to be an administrator for my part and they should be, they, are they're going to be, they, may you have to be separated that may have to be combined with some have to be combined.\nZRAN\nSome have to be separated. And also we have, you know, I don't know if they decide to bring everyone else, but we have executive protection division. We have intelligence division. We have a G sock with dispatch, and we may incorporate all the training for all of them kind of, you know, so it's either going to be under either Anna or… Anna or me or each area.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The goal is to choose a top three by the end of October, so they can start using it soon after that.\n• They're going to recommend their top 3 choices to the VP.  \n• Global Security has different requirements depending on location, such as compliance training or company-required training; some may need to be combined while others separated into sections within departments like Executive Protection Division, Intelligence Division and G sock Dispatch Training.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"ZRAN\nI may have their own administrator because not everyone is suppose to see everyone elses training, you know?\nKEVIN\nYeah, of course.\nZRAN\nStop. Sometimes… sometimes we want to share more like Anthony and I want to share more of the training. But if for example, the decided to bring on the intelligence unit, there may be something that they do not want other people to see. So.\nKEVIN\nOf course, of course. So the ability to really segment who sees what specific user roles within the platform. And also maybe the ability to delegate some of the admin Permissions to allow others within the platform, maybe to manage users or content. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Well, what we'll do with the… the last 15 minutes of the call today is I'm gonna turn it over to Scott. We'll go ahead and get started. It is going to be kind of a high level view. From the learner perspective, even a kind of a delegated role and an admin within the platform and we'll kind of talk through each of those.\nKEVIN\nAnd then if there's anything that you see today that you want a more detailed dive or an additional demo, we're happy to get that scheduled in the next couple of days to accommodate the timeline?\nZRAN\nOkay. Thank you.\nSCOTT\nThat's good. Awesome. So, you know, we'll dive right into it. I think I only want to show one slide to give an idea of where we are going to go in this conversation and… and how we're gonna structure the call today. I only have one slide. I promise it's just one and it just kinda highlights, you know, Docebo is… is more than just an LMS company.\nSCOTT\nWe do have a suite of products that covers the gamut from content creation to we've got a full content library. So if you think about, you know, from a global security perspective, maybe there is, you know, obviously compliance training based on state by state basis, but also things like ongoing optional training, locational training that people might engage in after the fact we have a ton of content in our library.\nSCOTT\nObviously, the Docebo LMS is where we're going to be spending the majority of our time today. But I also wanted to highlight when we think about things like measuring the impact that training is having a, you know, if you're familiar with Kirkpatrick model or, you know, feeding all this information to a business analytics tool and understanding, you know, what is we're spending all this money on training? What is the impact it's having? And also what is the end result for the business, right? What… what needles have we moved with our training? We can handle that?\nZRAN\nSo here's the question is your library in, is the function you just mentioned? Are that, are they all part of the cost or that's an additional cost? So the platform.\nSCOTT\nDocebo learn LMS on the bottom right is our core product and it is a self contained thing. It has all of the, you know, it's got survey engine, test engine, all that kind of stuff. Everything that was on your list of requirements content is separate because not all of our customers need.\nZRAN\nOkay. And the analytics?\nSCOTT\nWe have a full reporting engine. If you want to get like a BI tool, like an external BI software that is additional that it's a separate product.\nZRAN\nNow, watch what you just mentioned if you on Tuesday to show the impact or, you know, training, all that, is that part of the… of the cost or is that an additional cost?\nSCOTT\nEach of these is a product in itself? So you could purchase just the learning impact tool and product. You don't have to get the elements to get learning impact. But of course, we integrate with all of our different.\nZRAN\nOkay. So later when we talk about costs, please let us know what the basic cost, what would be the cost for that? And also what would be the cost? If, for example, if we have a specific training, but we want your team to make it look really professional or, you know, go over the content and make sure, you know, that it's all, you know, all that stuff. Sure.\nKEVIN\nAnd…\nZRAN\nDesigning, incorporating videos and all that stuff.\nKEVIN\nYeah, for sure. To know what Scott is going to cover today is all going to be core LMS function. We're not gonna see anything having to do with analytics or impact, but I'll provide you some marketing pieces. I'll send over some pricing on it. If you're interested in taking a look at that, let us know. Like Scott… Scott mentioned, we do have analytics built into the platform. This is kind of taking it to that next step. Okay?\nZRAN\nThank…\nSCOTT\nYou, for you, the reporting here too as well as we get into the system today, cool. So what we did then is, you know, if the team and I, Kevin myself got together and put together a version of, you know, Docebo that we think highlight some of the things that your team might be using.\nSCOTT\nAnd obviously we didn't know exactly what the Audience might look like or who might be doing the training. So, you know, trying to the mind what we're trying to show off here today is flexibility. And you mentioned already that you might have different audiences that need different types of training. So what we're going to see today like Kevin said is the LMS, this is all for the LMS, it comes to the system. It's all part of the small part of our product here. But I wanted to highlight that using even the same exact system, right? So I'm on WB dash demo here, we can use the exact same system to expose even really different brand look and feel for potentially a subsidiary, right? So if you had new line cinema, for example, you wanted to have some of their branding or kind of a different look and feel or color scheme, or even have, you know, one Audience signing in with single sign on over here, a different Audience signing in with just user name and password, a different Audience registering themselves, right?\nSCOTT\nWe can support different use cases using a single platform… right? And we're going to be passing all of the information about these learners in automatically. So that based on their job title, based on their location, based on the state that they're in, they will get the version of the system that makes sense for them.\nSCOTT\nAnd that includes languages, right? So we support 42 languages today, and that includes, you know, Spanish but also last time Spanish and includes French, but also French, Canadian, English, right? So, so a lot of flexibility there.\nZRAN\nDoing the translation to all these languages. Is that an AI or is that a person going over every training and translating it correctly?\nSCOTT\nSo we… we translate the platform, right? So the, all of the interface, the buttons, the… the hard coated text, anything that is part of the Docebo environment, we translate.\nZRAN\nYour…\nSCOTT\nContent is up to you to translate if you want to, if you wanna use something like Shape our content creation tool that has translation baked in for content. But when I'm saying the platform is translated into 42 languages that's done by humans by native speakers. And it is the platform itself. It's all the buttons, all the interface.\nZRAN\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\nSCOTT\nYep. So when someone gets into the system again depending on who they are, they might see, you know, a dashboard like this, the WB training academy with, you know, community courses, different areas to go.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Zran and Kevin discussed the need for segmentation of user roles within the platform, as well as delegation of admin permissions to allow others to manage users or content.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"ZRAN\nI can ask a question before we move forward. Yeah. So is that… that place that it just shows up, sold us is this is where, for example, if they have… far on permanent, that is gonna expire, is this is where I'm gonna upload that information and run their certification, whether again it's a firearm permanent, where it's a CPR permit or a guard card from it is, this is where the licensing would it be? How house and I can see when they expire in this. But again, that system is gonna do that for me. Once I upload that information and say it expires every five years, every year, every six months, the system will start doing that the tracking for us, right?\nSCOTT\nYep. Exactly. And again, you can… you can put that information in for someone. So if you are uploading that or someone on your team is uploading it, that's fine. Or for example, Power user, right? If you've got somebody who has a Power user profile that's been configured so that they can manage that particular certification.\nSCOTT\nSo fire on, for example, but you can also allow learners to submit it themselves if you want them to be able too. And that will have to go through an approval process, right? So the right person will get notified even if you're offloading that to the learner themselves, which will still go through an approval process before they actually.\nKEVIN\nA certification?\nZRAN\nOkay. So, for example, if somebody has a new license, whether again it's a firearm license or guard card, they upload an image and then it goes to the respective manager to view and approve. And then the officer would get an email saying we have received your or your certification is up been uploaded and, you know, whatever verbiage you wanna use, correct?\nSCOTT\nExactly. You can customize that verbiage as well. Thank you. Yep platform has In-app Notifications, push Notifications to someone's phone. If they have the application like the, you know, it could be the WB academy app, but also we do send, you know, emails as well. And you can customize exactly what the system says when it says it to those people in who it says it too.\nSCOTT\nAwesome. So from a formal perspective, again recovering E learning in-person training and webinars, the certification pathways that come from those things, all of the user segmentation from an experience perspective and moving people along as they complete their relevant certifications. But also what are the highlight that if you're thinking about creating a little bit more dynamism in a platform like this, maybe it's this is like a year or two thing.\nSCOTT\nMaybe it's like five years from now. I wanted to highlight that you can turn on our social part of the system where you allow learners to, you know, see content. It's not necessarily a course. So maybe it's just a video. Like I uploaded the DC fan don't video, right? It could be handy documents that people might want to have access to really quickly. It's not in a course but it's… it's on its own right? And maybe someone wants to come in here and they're not sure who to ask but they need to have a question and they want to ask maybe the leadership team, you know, how can I do a thing or find a specific?\nZRAN\nCan hi, can I house certain forums over there for them to download or maybe even to complete over there in a form, you know, like Microsoft forms?\nSCOTT\nYes. So we allow for embedding as well. So even if you wanted to actually use Microsoft forms, you can actually in I frame Microsoft forms, a particular form directly in the system as you can just kinda embed it. The other option as well. If we're thinking about, you know, interactivity, right? I know there's that requirement for people not only to do like a powerpoint, but also potentially if you want people to upload something, download something completed and upload the results, you can give them assignments.\nZRAN\nYeah, for example, if somebody has a daily activity report, yeah.\nZRAN\nCan we house the daily activity, the templates over there in the person goes and either completed over there or, and then can download it and save the door, email it or can they just maybe even completed directly over there? Or, you know, we have different kinds of, you know, or email it to someone and can we make these forums like available equivalent of available PDF or use available PDF and make them sign these forums?\nZRAN\nAnd… and, but again, let's say they wrote and special incident report and I need them to go back later to add something, go to edit it. Can we have the original form and then have the second one so that we have kind of like a nobody can say later that they've went in there and change scots, you know, if they are, but Scott, but I want to have that option. But again, then it would show that Zoom this edit. Again, this is for.\nSCOTT\nYeah, purposes later. So, yeah. So there was a… a series of questions there.\nZRAN\nRight?\nSCOTT\nUnpack it. I'm gonna unpack it and go backwards but at the… the… the really capability here is, yes, you can give someone fill ubl forums. You can allow them to download, fill it in and put it back into the system. That can go for review. If you've got someone else that needs to make sure that it's… it's kosher, that it looks good, that it's… it's on point. It's possible for your team to actually put together things like checklists. So if you have a daily activity report or something like that, you can create a fill ubl form here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Zran asked about the capability to upload and manage certifications, as well as allow learners to submit them for approval.\n• Zran asked if they can house certain forms on the platform for users to download and complete, or even fill out directly.  END"}
{"prompt":"JESSICA\nAnyway, it's just when you launch it out of Docebo, it's going to link over to that three PL site. So we just need to make sure that our users are getting created over there.\nETHAN\nOkay. That makes sense. So from the table side, things are pretty open for that.\nETHAN\nWe have the endpoints to support that. The part that's kind of a gray area. And I did try to do some homework on it with health stream is if they have their endpoints open for us to both feed that data and grab it, they don't publicly publish their API documentation for me to confirm that. So I was wondering on your end, have you gotten a chance to look into that or that I want confirm?\nJESSICA\nThey, they haven't published their API documentation. They are still in the early phases of development. They have a few things that are developed and available now. And I think with the use of the connect site, they have some ability, they have some further ability than what their LC product has.\nJESSICA\nWe recently had a call with health stream and their integrations manager. So they're aware of this. They're working on what potential solutions need to be put in place on their side. So it sounds like we probably would just need to maybe get a conjoined call and let's talk about what's available and then get you all talking to each other, and then we can determine what might need to be developed or modified.\nETHAN\nYeah. You hit the nail on the head. We just need to what's open and available on their end open on our end.\nTOBIAS\nAnd just you to leave behind in your notes to that integration person you spoke to.\nJESSICA\nI did, yes, I've got that in there and I'll follow up with you before the end of the week on that.\nETHAN\nSo I guess that's a safe place to park health stream. Well.\nTOBIAS\nI had a, I had a quick question. So let's say… we don't need the API to work. Is there a possibility to just move those aicc files… directly into those April? I mean, I know it's not ideal. It's not what we want. I'm just asking them like the possibility.\nETHAN\nManually do it. Is that what you're suggesting?\nJESSICA\nWell, I mean, the AC files are hosted in Docebo. It's the launch behavior is launching out to the host site, which is the three PL site. So it would take the vendor giving us like a scorm base package that doesn't require launching out to another host. Like it would have, you know what I mean? Like it would have to be a different file to, I would.\nJONATHAN\nSo just to jump in there, I think with, I think the AC should be fine. That should get automatically feedback, some of the content, but, well, I think having that call with the integration manager, we'll be good to confirm that. But I guess for getting the actual aicc files in themselves, is there a current way to just do that bulk export of the content from health stream?\nJESSICA\nYeah, we have that and we have the files. We've just, we've tested. Okay, there's no connection right now because the user there's no user feed.\nJONATHAN\nRight. Okay. Yeah. So.\nTOBIAS\nRight. Or.\nJESSICA\nNo user feed from Docebo to health stream. And because that unique ID is generating that back end Docebo ID, we don't have any way to pop.\nJONATHAN\nMaybe.\nJESSICA\nEither.\nTOBIAS\nThat makes more sense to me now, okay?\nJESSICA\nOkay.\nJONATHAN\nOkay. Yeah. So we'll still need to have that conversation. But so the files already exist and are they already in the like in your instance?\nJESSICA\nA few, just a few test ones. We have the whole catalogue. Yeah.\nJONATHAN\nOkay. Okay. So, yeah, we'll still need to back conversation with the integration manager.\nTOBIAS\nOkay. So… looks like you'll have to work for me to set that up. Okay. Well, we'll be happy to do that. Yeah, we'll work on that. Who would I work with David?\nDAVID\nYeah, I'll feel free to reach out to me, Tobias if you have a name or some availability and I'll coordinate that all with the, you know, the team on the call today. Happy to, I wrote that down.\nJONATHAN\nThe item, but…\nDAVID\nYeah, I appreciate it. And yeah, Ethan, just to kinda piggyback of you. I guess we could piggy back that now. Maybe obviously if the team has any questions that happy to discuss, but I guess we could talk about dialing now… if Ethan, if you agree with that.\nETHAN\nYeah, as long as the folks are satisfied with where we've done the testing, okay, cool.\nETHAN\nSo sailing as I reviewed what was discussed and documented earlier, the goal was to get the content from Eileen into Docebo, right? At a high level, that's what we're going to do. And then in order to facilitate this… using connect in particular, we needed to get the information for the courses from Salem, put them in a repository or a WS as three bucket and then feed that into Docebo. And this S, three bucket was actually going to be used in a few of the other use cases you had. There was talk of Ed cast.\nJESSICA\nAnd…\nETHAN\nPen, pen, opto. There was one one inkling. So we were going to have this flow that takes the content from these various sources, places it into the singular place to feed to do.\nETHAN\nIs there anything new around that? It said we've it's already been discussed before? So you might have already had most of the kinks, but I'm just here to confirm.\nTOBIAS\nI think, I don't know why we needed to continue the conversation about central repository. Sorry, because the thought is if central repository will truly meet our needs, we may not need to do this Dale integration. There's one thing that we need to follow up on internally because I think we agree that central repository can potentially do… what Dale is doing for us today, with the exception of being able to content externally… without you needing a Christus authentication method. And so that's one thing that link does for us today, but we recently upgrade it to Sharepoint online. So I noticed that was one of the main benefits of Sharepoint online is that if you put something in that repository, it could then be public facing. So… my inclination would be to let us finish that first we.\nJONATHAN\nBecause quite…\nTOBIAS\nHonestly, like we're looking at Sharepoint online, bringing it into some of the other integrations that we're doing. I would want to Chase down that before we use one of our integrations… here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Jessica and Ethan discussed the possibility of linking Docebo to a three PL site, but Health Stream's API documentation is not publicly available.\n• Jessica had already spoken with Health Stream's integration manager and was going to follow up by the end of the week.\n• Tobias asked if there was any way to move AICC files directly into April without needing an API, which Jonathan suggested could be done manually.\n• David offered to coordinate a call between all parties involved in order for them confirm what needs development or modification on either side before proceeding further with their plans.\n• They considered using Sharepoint Online as it would provide public access without authentication when added into other integrations they are doing.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"ZRAN\nSo we didn't speak about, didn't talk about price I think yet. But just in general, you know, we don't we, you know, we don't wanna work with a company where we know what we pay. And then every time we say hello with cost us like 5,000 dollars.\nZRAN\nYou know, we went to, we went again, we… we understand that you guys, you know, got to make a living somehow, but also we just, we wanna make sure that if we work with a company and we find out that they were missing something. And clearly, there's stuff that it's gonna cost more money. We understand that. But there's you know, some little things system is great, but it's missing something specific yep, how does it?\nSCOTT\nWork. So there's actually several ways that we tackle that. I think it's actually much more easily explained if I show you on the administrative side because that's where those decision to happen, right? You're thinking like, I wish I had a report that did this or I want, I wish we had a page that look this way or did this thing, right? So, you know, if I… if I sign up here and I'll show you what this looks like because I think it's a two step process to kind of understanding how we handle these things, right? If I log in as an admin, our policy Docebo is that you should have full control over your own system. Of course, it comes with a customer experience manager who you can ask for help. And like, I don't know how to do this thing. I want to, can you help me out those kinds of things?\nSCOTT\nWe will help? But let's say you run into a situation where hey, we're… we're doing some reports and we like we liked the reports that came with this is, we liked that. They're attractive to show us the information we need. It's got all the good stuff here. But two months in six months and you decide we need something new. We don't think it's fair that if there is a report that you want to run, the system doesn't have baked in that you should have to pay money for it. We think that you should be able to go in and create it yourself. We do have services that we can do it for you and can do an S. So W, we create the custom report and all that kind of stuff. But you don't have to do that. You can easily come in. Say, I wanna look at certain relationship honesty certifications, you know, specifically, some course report certifications, and, you know, we have very specific requirements. I'm, gonna put my own filters on it. I'm going to capture my own data that's coming from the HR system, for example, right? So we want to see their first name, job title, email, whatever it is, create all of your custom reporting parameters. And then you can even schedule that and say, listen, I'm gonna run this report every two weeks and it's gonna go out to, you know, start on the month is almost over starting on the 30 first and we're going to send it to the right people.\nSCOTT\nThere is no cost associated with creating new reports. There is no cost associated with coming in here and let's say you want to build a new page, remember, I showed, we showed you that really cool custom page. I'm gonna show you a peek behind the curtain. It probably looks like it took us a long time to build this. I don't wanna knock your… your design capabilities there, Kevin, but take a look at this, right? If you go to the composer and you say we want to change this banner or I want something new, we want to remove that gift of wonder woman, and we want to put gamification and badging, right?\nSCOTT\nIf there's something that you wanted to have in the system that wasn't a part of your initial implementation, you can just added in, move it around. And suddenly the page has you just different states. So there's no cost associated with doing those things. If you're thinking about instead you're thinking about like, okay, we want the platform to do X, but it doesn't do X at all. We actually, I have a communication center and then ideas portal that allows you to talk directly to our development team. So let's say you want some specific thing. So, hey, a lot of people, back when teams first came out, they said we want teams or we want the admin to be able to sign in as someone else. So you can actually have conversations with our development team and our product owners, and they'll work with you to make sure that the thing that you need and the thing, you know, if it's if that requirement is shared by many of our customers, then it'll go on the roadmap will build. It will tell you when it's gonna get shipped. And then we'll tell you, we'll send you a reminder that, hey, we built the thing you asked for it, right? So there's… there's different pieces to this, but I think it's important to note that when you're building pages or when you have custom reports and you have something specific you want to do, you can do it yourself. But we do of course, have like if you want to get a custom report built or something like that, don't want to go through the interface, we have, you know, help on our side too. Does that answer your question a little bit?\nZRAN\nYes. So two questions first, assuming which was you guys? Are you're going to be the person who's gonna work with Anna on me in the first two months making sure everything kind of goes smoothly because clearly we may be expert on the system later, but we are not right now, right? And… and the second question… is… is updates to the system, part of the basic cost or that, you know, some people to say, no, this is you're paying this, you want to update, you gotta pay X amount of money.\nSCOTT\nNope. It's all baked in it's all baked in. So you don't have to worry about that. Kevin. I'll let you speak in just a second. I also wanna our team. We… we take it very team based approach. You can tell there's three people from Docebo on this call alone, but when it comes to implementation and onboarding, we actually have a team of specialists that are meant to both educate you on how to get up to speed, but also to help, you… you know, kind of identify what are the things we should be doing. How should we build the system? We take a train the trainer approach. So we make sure that you know how to set it up. We'll guide you along that process. But your team actually does the clicks.\nSCOTT\nIf instead you watch a completely build it for us experience. We do have implementation partners that we work with that we can hook you up with. But I think, you know, it's important to note that we have a full educational thing where we… we also show you how to do all of this. It's part of the onboarding… right? That's an important note. Kevin. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there. Go ahead.\nKEVIN\nThat's okay. Basically what I was, all I was gonna clarify was there will be two costs on an invoice from Docebo. There's going to be the licensing costs for the products that you purchase.\nKEVIN\nIncluded in that are the releases, are, you know, ongoing maintenance, things like that. The other cost is just that upfront onboarding. That is going to be the training for your admin. It would be any migration information, you know, any migration data that we would put on there for you that's it there's not any unexpected fees or hidden costs that you're not going to be prepared for.\nZRAN\nYeah. Okay. Thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Zran discussed the importance of working with a company that is transparent about cost and not charging extra for small requests. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\nI think it's worth mentioning at this point because we're thinking about things like costing and… and things like that. I saw the requirement to keep records for seven years and those kinds of things in… in a system like this… this is actually a really great one to do long-term record keeping.\nSCOTT\nAnd because of our engagement model, our licensing model, right? So it's monthly active users. So if someone logs into the system and takes training in that month, they're considered active. If someone just logs in and upload their certificate, they're not considered active in our system. They actually have to go and take training. They have to watch a video. They have to engage with content that's what counts that active, which means you can have 100,000, 200,000 records in here for seven years. And there's no cost associated with keeping those records. If someone, one of those people that's where he hired and they come back in and they take some more training, then, yeah, they're active for that month that they took training. And but yeah, I think it's worth mentioning. You can use the same license for 10 different people if those people are active in different months, right? And I think it's a really attractive option when we think about long-term record keeping like that. Okay? Yes.\nZRAN\nSo that's pair. So your… your pricing model is per user subscription?\nSCOTT\nIt's a monthly active user model, kind of think of it like a… like a cell phone plan, right? Where you get like one gigabyte worth of data, you pay for the gigabyte, you might use 900 megabytes, you don't might not get the full gigabyte but you pay for the… the one gigabyte for the course of the year. And that's your plan. And of course, if you do grow with the organization continues to grow or your department continues to grow, you can always increase that number. And we'll work with you on that one. But yeah, you get the plan. You have a certain number of people that can access and take training in a given month and that will reset every month as you go through.\nZRAN\nSo, in… in… in theory, the invoice, the monthly invoice is going to be different every month.\nKEVIN\nThe way that it works is basically you choose a plan that will accommodate the projected number of users. So if you pay upfront for the year, it's based on a three year contract term. And so you wouldn't from month to month, fluctuate and pay, we would… we would build out a plan that would accommodate all your users. So typically, you know, because we're monthly active, what we see with our clients is typically about 30 to 40 percent of your total user base, is what you're gonna see as the monthly adoption number. So, you know, if you have 3,000 people were talking about like a 1,000 user plan, maybe 1,500 users.\nZRAN\nOkay.\nSCOTT\nIt's also worth mentioning, we would think about those monthly active users, some of the people who are going to be potentially in the system, helping out our people, like instructors, people like managers, people that will be in the system, Power users, right?\nSCOTT\nI saw that requirement on your list of things that you need. So the interesting thing here is that those people unless they're taking training are also not considered active. They'd be able to see their team. They'd be able to see who's… who's asking questions. We can see, you know, some of the things that have been shared, but they can also come in here and run a quick report on their team.\nSCOTT\nJust see a summary. Maybe they have nine people that are responsible for, right? Or a small team of individuals. We can say like, hey, Ashley, sure, locking Georgina. Or maybe tomlin hasn't expired firearms certificate, right? We can see all of from one place, send them all an email or enroll them into a course to kind of fix that, right? So it is up to you. Now, in this… in this case, I've given this person some administrative rights and I did see also on your list of requirements that you need an unlimited capability for creating Power users in different… different types of Power users. So we have that you can create different profiles. So you've got like a manager profile where they can do these things. And you've got like a director profile, they can do those things, right? So that… that Power can extend only to a certain sub Audience, right? So just that team or that, you know, that sergeant with that team or when they run a report, you might expose to them only seven reports where they could just click the button and it shows them the data, right?\nSCOTT\nThey don't have to be an L and D specialist, just click the button. It shows them what they need. And they can see, for example, they're team is taking 15 courses right now, but I might have eight people reporting directly to me, but I'm also responsible for 50 people, right? And all of this of course, can be exportable if you want to just take this out as an excel spreadsheet, PDF, those kinds of things. And this can also be automatically pulled out of the system and pushed into, you know, a different area, Power BI or something along those lines of using Microsoft tools. So, and I wanted to be quite clear because we started the beginning of this demonstration where I talked about with the different tools we have, this is all the LMS, everything we're showing you here is the LMS. This is not like our analytics tool. It obviously has analytics if we can see reports not just on people we can see reports on the certifications they've done.\nSCOTT\nYou can do customized reporting, all those kinds of things. This is really, you know, all LMS base data once we start thinking about the other tools that's when we start thinking about like, okay, how does training relates to churn, right? How does you know our people hitting their KPI'S more if they're completing their training faster, those kinds of stories where it's more business related? Okay. So then, you know, with our 15 minutes that we've got left in the… in the clock here, I wanted to see where their specific administrative functions that the team wanted to take a look at, where they're things that you saw in a different system that were exciting that you're hoping that the table.\nZRAN\nFor someone, I kind of mentioned it, I want to verify that we're able to use Octa, verify for authentication because that's what the company uses. And in theory, a person can log in from any computer as long as they have to verify with them, correct?\nSCOTT\nYou are correct. And we use Octa internally. So we very selfishly built an integration.\nZRAN\nOkay. So that's easy. How do I create groups? Let's say I need to assign a specific training for group and maybe I need to sign and a person may be a part of what more than one?\nSCOTT\nYes, exactly. So the way that we deal with user management, and to your point, a person might be a part of more than one group. We have this idea of Branches versus groups, right? And Branches is any time people can be easily organized into one spot. For example, maybe you're in DC comics or new line cinema or something like that, right? You're in one group and with a new line, you might have customers or partners or something like that. Now groups. On the other hand, so that… that information comes in automatically, right? We build it based on your Organizational hierarchy. Groups. On the other hand, for example, myself, I'm a solutions consultant, but I'm also in, from a training perspective, I'm in sales and from a training perspective, I'm actually an operations as well.\nSCOTT\nI'm actually not on the sales team, technically Docebo. So when I get my training, I am in three of those groups and I get training and experience. It's built like lego, right? It starts with my solution consulting requirements. And on top of that, I get my sales training.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Zran wants to verify they can use Octa verify for authentication and a person can log in from any computer. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\nAnd on top of that, I get my operations training. And the way that we put that together is using basically your business logic, right? So if we think about, you know, training group, we're going to create a rule in the system so that we don't have to continuously go back and edit this. We can just build some basic conditions. And if those things are true, you go in that group, you get that training. So it could be simple, right? It could be like your job title, right? Again, we're passing all this information in this could be passing the after it can be passed through to get an HR system. But job title plus maybe if your job title contains consultant and your in DC universe or something like that. And on top of that, you are completed your security… right? So you've completed that particular training. We're going to create a condition group that's gonna put you in that group and you're ready to get certain training, certain experience. You're going to show up in certain reports. If these things change, right? Maybe your job title changes, for example, then you will be automatically move into the right group that makes sense for you based on the training requirements that we have, right?\nZRAN\nI can add your… your move real from whatever group you are just by going and uncheck them up. You know, something near your name or in the group?\nSCOTT\nYes. And you can choose whether that is manually done by like I remove you from this group or if we think about it, right? If we go to the… the user management section of the system, again, right? We are able to track any kinds of additional content fields that you need, right? So, up to 50 things, these are just examples. So job title, hired date, whatever. So every user has this information, which means you can go into the HR system and change it there. And Docebo will automatically move them to the right group, give them the right.\nZRAN\nHi, this is going to be a stand alone system. You, we are not getting again, this is a big company. Yep, we are not getting with anywhere from anything from an HR. Okay. So you're saying, for example.\nSCOTT\nFile feed, maybe.\nZRAN\nSo I can defined somebody who's a new hire and say you have this requirement. Once you're done with this requirement, you'll become a set watch and now you were promoted and now your fulltime officer. Yeah. So at that point, I will have to go and do it manually because it's… it's not something that is based on… on something, you did something based on a management decision.\nSCOTT\nRight.\nZRAN\nRight. So once you become an officer or an acting sergeant or surgeon and I mark you as such, it will attached to your all the training that we all the… all the rules basically that recreated for that position?\nSCOTT\nExactly. Yep. And you could even do a drop-down if you know the titles. So like officer sergeant, these kind of things, you just do a drop one or two.\nZRAN\nYeah, we know. And I'm pretty sure that dumped on his side noise where everything it's… it's not something that would come up. You know, it's you have something that's kinda sit.\nSCOTT\nPerfect. But even if it's not set like one day you decide to change it, you can just come in here, go to your additional fields, choose, you know, the drop-down for… for job title and then add new element, right? Add new job titles. Okay. Right. And all of these different things you exactly, you would build the rules.\nSCOTT\nAnd then whenever someone got promotion or there was a management decision, it's come into the system, flip the switch in our system and then the right person would get the right training to get all the content that they.\nZRAN\nOkay.\nSCOTT\nHopefully, that makes sense. I mean, I think this is a really cool thing because, yeah, that allows you to do is to build your business logic, right? Yeah, those are, but also first…\nZRAN\nWe, we have, and again, this is… this is not part of this project that though, but it seems like your system may have that capability. We have something we call a daily information, put it okay, which is basically… department… kinda… kinda. You know, like I'm not gonna send newspaper because it's not, but it's basically information that the officers need to know. Yep, do you have some kinds of capabilities over here to create that the IB and they'd be able to log in and read that, the ap from here and then download it if they need to and printed or stuff like that?\nSCOTT\nCertainly. And… and we have some organizations that are doing that today where they're basically creating either a course that… that it gets sent out to everyone and it's just… just a core shell but they can access the content, read it, download it, maybe do an E signature to prove that they did read it.\nSCOTT\nAnd that way you have audit trail on that, right? Because you get full reporting on everything that people are too.\nZRAN\nYes, it's… it's literally a model is again, it's data information bulletin, which if you come to roll call, they'll go over it with you. But if not, if you're an application, you know, that is not, you don't comfortable code, Oregon location, maybe a flop or, you know, again, you may be working in another state or country to date. But assuming it would that so that's kind have like an online paper. Is that something that… that, you know, be able to log into that and maybe even almost in a separate area from… from the training? Because it's not necessarily training. It's a daily thing that we may require them to go. And again then they can mark that they read it or, you know, if there's a new policy or we make them read the new additions to… to the VIP and… and kind of make sure that they read it and sign that they read that. And stuff like that is… that. Is that thing. Again, can we save every version of it and can we search?\nSCOTT\nAnd that's the other thing. So it's searchable. The, we do have version control baked into the system. So if you, we have something called the central repository where you can save in a folder, all of the things fall under that category. And then if you do need to change the version, let's say it's a document or video, whatever it is that you're sharing it. I know you mentioned documents. So document you share that out, you can see which version will share it out, how many are live? What is the current updated version, who uploaded the last version? And then of course, we do have reporting in the back end. So if we think about if I go to my course base reporting… open something up here… right? We can go into one of these. Let's say again it's not an e-learning course. It's like a, an actual file at someone had to download. We can see there's a big uptick in people downloading it and viewing it today. We can see every person who did it when they did it, right?\nSCOTT\nSo we go into Bruce Wayne here. We can see that, you know, he went through it. We could see that he engaged, last access was on June July fourth. You know, 2028 2020 18. And then again, even if you have individual content or documents or things like that, you can see when they first did it, last did it that they read it, and we can track all of that on an individual basis.\nZRAN\nOkay. Yeah. Okay. And that will be saved. This is not going to be seven years. This if we do, that… that has to be safe basically for, you know, probably 15 years.\nSCOTT\nSave for the length of your contract. So if you're with Docebo, we will maintain those records indefinitely. And then if you ever choose to break up, we will be able to export all of your content information.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Zran mentioned a daily information system where officers can log in to read content and download it if they need to.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"KEVIN\nOn the best part is if those users are no longer with you, but you have to keep their records, they're not logging in. They're not taking training, you're not paying for them. You're storing a whole records for…\nSCOTT\nFree.\nZRAN\nAnd I can manually go and mark somebody is terminated or resigned or retired and that will automatically the system will see that didn't stop sending them email and prevent them from logging in and let's say somebody is no longer working for us but they need access to their… continuing education. Is that possible for them to log in and only download? Like, is there a way for me to say all the other email is not going to be viable anymore… viable anymore because they're no longer with the company? Let's say they have to contact me and I gave them a one time quarter or something to download their educational records?\nSCOTT\nYeah, it's up to you. I mean, if, obviously, if you're using Octa to get their access, then they would need to be able to access through October.\nZRAN\nThey will not have that. Okay. Just a new I is… is, so that's I'm saying, is there a way for me to say, Scott, you know, who was terminated four months ago?\nZRAN\nYou know, required isn't is asking access for he's continuing education. Because the other option is me going there and sending in that information because this belongs, although we pay for that… that information belongs to them. And by law, I have to provide them certificate. And if they lost a certificate, I still have to give them one, you know?\nSCOTT\nYeah, I understand. So. So you can preset up the system in a way that Audience access is through October because they're active and Audience be has a user name and password where you can give them a one time password. They log in. They have access to all of the things.\nSCOTT\nThey can download it. But here's, the beautiful thing is that you can set it up so that if they're an Audience be, they cannot take new training, which means that we're not activate themselves. And means that there is no cost associated with them to come in and download the certificate.\nZRAN\nAnd is there a way for me to go into somebody's record and see… and… and maybe even download all their certificates? Somebody let's say we don't want to do that. Yeah, they get here. Say, no, we don't want to do it. Can I have access and go to scots file, download everything and, you know, either through the system or down or the clearly, if it's through the system, it's easier for the system.\nZRAN\nSay, hey, download also duplicates and attach it to an email. And I parties person an email at this point and send it to them.\nSCOTT\nYes. So, yes, but let me show you so you can click a, you can do a quick… quick user summary, for example, like Ashley Anderson, pull out her transcript of everything that she's done, a generate the report printed out or downloaded as a PDF, upload it into your own email and set it out or you can set up the system so that it sends out an email with that content.\nSCOTT\nBut this is probably easier if you just printed out or download the… the results as a PDF and send it off.\nZRAN\nYou pay. It depends if I can say every time somebody is terminated resigned retirement, the system will take all their, you know, a certification and information and kinda download everything and send them an email… you know, for their records or something.\nSCOTT\nIt is possible to send them a link that will take them to that report, but it's not possible to automate that. It will download and send it so that you can either manually download and send or you can automatically send them a link that will give them access.\nZRAN\nOkay, great. And I can download the specific certificates and save it as a certificate, not as a link and… and as a PDF and send it to whoever, you know, they're continuing education certificate.\nLILIT\nThey're…\nSCOTT\nAlso here's, the person actually understand she's quit here's. The certificates they've done. If I'm looking for a specific one, I can go in and say, okay, I want this particular certificate, download it. Now, it's a PDF on my computer and I can.\nZRAN\nOkay. Sounds good.\nSCOTT\nCool. Well, hopefully this has been interesting. I know we've gone right up to the hour. So I know you're in a expedited timelines. We want to get as much information as possible in a one call. So, thanks for your time.\nKEVIN\nIf a real quick before we go today, is there anything any reason based on the demo today, that you feel that Docebo is not the best fit for what you are looking to do?\nZRAN\nWell, what we didn't talk about it all is… is pricing. So, if you guys in, you know, talk to us about pricing a little bit. And also if you can tell us something about the company where you house, you know, how long you've been, you know, what do you do?\nZRAN\nBecause as I said, we're a security company and we're going to run reports intelligence report on… on… on… on all of the companies that we're gonna kinda move to the next stage.\nKEVIN\nOf course. Yeah. And we're not, I don't think there's any concern on our side for those reports.\nKEVIN\nI think we'll pass with flying colors. They just give you some background on Docebo. We were founded back in 2005 and be a sold out just outside of Milan, Italy. We have had the good fortune now growing six or seven offices globally with our headquarters now in Toronto last couple of years. We've gone public both on the TSX and nasdaq and what we've done is been able to use that capital for really exponential Growth. We've launched our product suite. We really put a lot into our people specifically to our customer success teams for onboarding and ongoing success. And we've also launch some additional products just to help you well in the future for integrations or to make it as easy for your users to be able to access the platform as possible.\nKEVIN\nAs Scott mentioned before. The way that we do our pricing model is monthly active users. So we don't care how many total users you have. We don't care how many courses you have, how much content you want to store on the platform or student records. All we care about is out of the total number of users who not only logs in any given month but complete some form of training, whether that's accessing documents, or of course, whether it's attending an in person session or clicking on a link to join a Webinar. So, would that being said, do you all have any idea? I mean, I'm sure, you know, how many total registered users you're gonna have.\nZRAN\nLet's do the calculation for five fun.\nLILIT\nGood for now.\nKEVIN\nOkay. So 500 total users or for monthly?\nZRAN\nIt's probably going to be total, but again, I, a lot of them are gonna do monthly, you know, little, you know, little things. So they may, we may get close to that, you know.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Zran and Lilit estimated that 500 total users would be registered with the platform, many of which will complete some form of training every month. END"}
{"prompt":"KEVIN\nActive users as well. Okay. So what Scott showed you today is our core LMS product. He also showed you discover coach and share, which is a social module that you can add on. What coach and share it includes is the ability to create a community, so user generated content where you can harness subject matter expertise, users can share best practices, they can share experiences, they can share documents resources. The second component of that is directly connecting your users with your subject matter experts to allow them to ask questions, get answers. There's even scenarios where your users can upload a video of themselves doing something maybe like a security check, and then the expert could review that video in real time and provide feedback.\nKEVIN\nThe last component of that allows the users to actually identify skills that they want to improve on. And you can go outside of your platform and your content to pull in news articles or videos based on sites you all white listed. So what I'll do is I'll quote our core LMS product for 500 users 27,000 a year based on a three year contract. And the discover coach and share my math skills are gonna fail me right now. Let me just punch it in and make sure I tell you everything is 10,800. The LMS does require an onboarding. Our gold launch pack would be 12,000 dollars. That's a one time fee.\nLILIT\nFor the discovery pack, you mentioned the 10 800 is that yearly?\nKEVIN\nYeah, that I still, and it's based both of those values are based on a three year agreement.\nLILIT\nAnd then how do we handle changes to the user number? So let's say it's like a year or two and we have a big spike and hiring and our number of users is increased.\nKEVIN\nYeah, great question. So when you become a partner Docebo, you're actually going to be assigned three resources. So you'll have your CRM deployment manager there, your onboarding specialists. They're going to be with you for the first 120 days. They're going to be meeting with you regularly training you on how to build and maintain the platform on long-term kinda like which Scott show today.\nKEVIN\nYou're also going to be assigned your customer experience manager and your account manager. Your account manager is my counterpart for our customers. So they're the sales side. If you need to increase numbers if you want to introduce new use cases, other business units a WB, they're gonna work with you on that and create the change order to the agreement.\nKEVIN\nSo not gonna extend the term of the contract, it will just add any of the upgrades that you want. Your customer experience manager. You're going to be meeting with on a monthly basis, you're going to have quarterly business reviews. The monthly basis is more to kinda keep you updated of those releases to help understand the successes you've had challenges you're facing and help you work through those. They also have those quarterly business reviews to help understand your goals for the year, kind of what you're looking to accomplish and help you optimize the platform in a way that's going to help you meet those goals.\nLILIT\nSo, just to clarify, so you're too, we have an increasing users. It doesn't mean that the three year contract starts again, it just as a change order. Okay?\nKEVIN\nThat's right? Yeah, you would. In year two, you can move up to a 1,000 monthly active users. The end of that initial term is still going to be two years. From that point, you're not going to extend it to a new three year contract.\nLILIT\nSounds good.\nKEVIN\nDo you have any?\nLILIT\nMore questions?\nZRAN\nNo, I think… I think we've kind of covered it, but again, let you're gonna make sure that we get all the pricing.\nKEVIN\nWe've got from the other, so can compare…\nZRAN\nEverything when we're done, right?\nLILIT\nYeah, of course. So if Kevin, I could get all of that in writing as well. That would be fantastic. And then will of course, be in touch.\nKEVIN\nAt this point, is it easiest? I can get it out the fastest? If I just send you like a table showing the prices or is it best to actually send you an order form with the numbers?\nLILIT\nAt the table will tell us all the information that we need based on number of users that we think will have, that should be, that should suffice for right now.\nKEVIN\nWorse. And did you wanna look at content at all or any of the other additional products that Scott showed up at the beginning of the call?\nLILIT\nProbably just the content portion of that could be also included. So we'll take that into consideration as well.\nKEVIN\nSure. Just so you all know, when I send the content portion, we have three different options. You can choose a 50 course bundle, 150 or the full, you know, 80,000 plus course library with any of those options. You are going to get a content specialist assigned through the duration of your partnership. So as you have new need for content, new topics, areas, you would just reach out to them.\nKEVIN\nThey're going to help you find the best content for the WB and get that loaded into your platform. So I'll send kind of those three options for 500 monthly active users. To, the other thing to note is as you scale up, you can always buy content for smaller user groups. So if you only need it for half of your population, you may have a 1,000 active users for the platform, but only 500.\nLILIT\nContent. Got it. Okay.\nKEVIN\nPerfect. Yeah, I can go ahead and get this content. You mentioned having a decision by the end of the month, I can get you the pricing by the end of the day today. What do the next steps or what does the timeline look like for the rest of the, of this month?\nLILIT\nSo we're going to do an internal review of all the folks we've spoken to and then kind of pick the couple of ones that we prefer and present it to our executives. And then once they make the decision on that, then we'll be reaching out to set things up.\nKEVIN\nYeah, of course. Sounds good. So well. I'll look to hear from you then on that aspect and you can look to get that email today. I'm also gonna send you a recording from today's, call an additional couple of other resources. So you all can review them. If you have any questions over the next couple of days certainly reach out. Like I said, Scott and I can, we can either schedule another call. We can record a couple of quick videos or we can just link you to our knowledge base as.\nLILIT\nFantastic. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Anna.\nZRAN\nBefore we go on time, do you have any… any questions?\nKEVIN\nNo questions from my end?\nZRAN\nOkay. Thank you. Then. Yeah, thank you all. And… and, you know, have a good day.\nKEVIN\nLinks I can. Excellent, thank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kevin presented the core LMS product and Discover Coach & Share, a social module with user-generated content, direct connections to subject matter experts for questions and feedback on videos of users performing tasks.\n• The cost for 500 users over a three year contract is $27,000 per year plus an onboarding fee of $12,000.\n• $10,800 is the yearly price for Discover Coach and Share.\n• They will have an internal review and present to their executives.\n• Kevin also discussed different options for content bundles ranging from 50 courses to 80k+ courses along with assigning a specialist who will help find relevant course material as needed.

{"prompt":"AARON\n37:16 \nThat sounds… great. Thank you. Brian back to you.\nBRIAN\n37:23 \nYeah, awesome. Thanks. I appreciate it. Alright. Shift gears here, talking about discover coach and share. So I know we briefly mentioned, we talked about kind of like a surface level demo of what discover coach and share did about a week ago. I just kinda wanted to pull this together so people can formally understand what is discover coach and share what are the needs, what gaps. So they fill in. So discover coach and share truly is looking at expanding on informal learning. So we understand in the E learning industry, you know, there's the 70 20 10 rule 10 percent of training is retained formally. This is how most elements as dictate and the rest of the 20 and 70 percent is informal, think about when you first started your job, you started there's a formal training which helped you get the basics. But kind of the informal training really cements that and put those pieces together. We have higher retention rate and we found the most successful learning platforms embrace social learning instead of just solely focusing on establishing strict curriculum. So as we keep that in mind as this is where our product team created discovery coach and share. So discovery coach and share will live on all menus. You know, for all users that you would like to utilize discovery coach and share it on from an admin perspective, we'll go in into the actual platform. So I can kinda showcase what it looks like. Some highlight high levels, but things to note that are important to discovery coach and share or expanded uses of channels. You can now share assets. This is really key in promoting an informal learning environment by informal just meaning users don't have to necessarily wait for an admin to assign them courses or they don't have to, you know, ingest very formal data. They can actually ingest videos or PDF that will help them. But aren't necessarily part of the learning plan. So channels themselves in tandem with content, let's say you find admins, don't necessarily want to build a huge course plan out of something they find in content and they would rather just push it to a channel to where the users who are subscribed to the channel can ingest that data. They can do so with the channels. So channels themselves are very similar to a course catalog. The main key difference is you can follow channels and your users will then get notified. The asking experts is also another functionality that really helps build that culture of informal learning. You can have certain experts be assigned by a super admin. Let's say this is a Power user in your system which is very knowledgeable in a, they can actually become experts to where if someone asks a question in a channel or in a course, if they are assigned the expert of said course, they will then get notified that… to be has asked question a on this course itself. They then can respond to them kind of creating a forum experience. So think about what you know, scrolling not necessarily Twitter or read it, but that's kinda the example that best makes sense here to where you can ask a question. People can upload it and then you can have an expert actually respond to that question helping other users are digesting that content along the way. So that kind of leads them to questions and answers. You can have a course widget to where it has questions and answers. So let's say you've asked specific questions, coach and share, you can build a new widget on the screen itself to where you can have all my questions and the answers to those questions, making it easier to find, you know, where did I, where did I ask this question? Where did, where did this live? There's a variety of ways to implement it. I say these are all, I know this is a lot of text. I don't want to be like too wordy on the text here. But the most successful implementations truly have been channel focused. So let's say Belden, selves create channels based on certain topics. Sure. If you're already utilizing channels, this is actually just an additional add on, but let's say you'd want to have additional compliant, well, not compliance but additional training regarding build an internal functions. Let's say you have PDF, you share with each other typically on teams or Slack. You can actually put that in the channel itself.\nCoach & Share ends\nBRIAN\n41:56 \nSo therefore it kinda creates a repository of information that they can pull quickly although we don't recommend that Docebo is your only repository for learning material. It can act as a supplement for users to then pull quickly, pull it. So preventing people from reaching out, you know, emailing you once again, hey, do you have that PDF on how to do this specific thing or do you know where I can find thing?\nCoach & Share\nBRIAN\n42:20 \nIt can just live within the channel itself and make it much easier for people to find what they need to for learning purposes.\nBRIAN\n42:30 \nSome best practices, you know, we definitely want to ensure that you're planning to be informal. I know that sounds or intuitive, you know, why would you want to be informal? But it actually helps create a less intimidating learning experience. A lot of new hires. We found they are very intimidated especially if it's a new industry that they're going in or whatever content it is there ingesting they're not sure, you know, who can I ask questions? Can I ask questions? Is there a powerpoint slide that's available regarding this? Is there what all is available here? Making it, you know, easier for those users to experience. The learning platform is a far more effective of a learning method really sementing that 70 and 20 percent rule that we mentioned earlier, you can create hubs within channels themselves to group channels together. So let's say you have a channel and once utilizing it, but you find that this other channel is more popular. You can retire it no problem. And it's a lot easier from the user's perspective to ingest that data just because from their side, all of the channels already sorted and they can just search within the channels themselves. I'll share this slide with you all after our meeting here. But this is additional information to kinda showcase, you know, certain resources. How can I do all this? So if you decide to utilize to cover coach and share, you aren't left alone, me and two of you will be here to assist you on best practices, you know, how to drive social learning and those kinds of initiatives as we shift gears into the actual demonstration. Any questions so far? Comments?\nCoach & Share ends\nBRIAN\n44:13 \nRight. No problem.\nTHUVEE\n44:15 \nI guess does this does from what you guys are seeing right now for the discovery cut share? Is it, does it sound like it's kind of what you guys had in mind? Does it, you know, is it meeting your next expectations or… just to get some feedback?\nCoach & Share\nTHUVEE\n44:31 \nBecause there, there's a number of ways that we can kinda demo it. So I just wanna make sure we're adjusting the points that are relevant to you guys.\nCLINT\n44:40 \nAnd for me, at least it was what the answer is, yes, it does in the sense that I would like for senior folks if I'm calling that within our organization to be able to share content like video for example that had a really great message I technically or from a broad leadership perspective and have it within, you know, the same platform at the end of the days as the entire learning experience.\nCoach & Share ends\nTHUVEE\n45:08 \nYeah, perfect. And then that's the exact intent of it. So awesome. Thank you, Quinn.\nJACOB\n45:15 \nHey, Clint. Just a quick question for you. Was there a particular Audience within Belden that you're looking at for this? Was it engineers, sales folks all be.\nCLINT\n45:29 \nSo for what I'm referring to Jacob, it's more for a GTS organization. So… solution consultants, engineers, Automation, consultants, those folks.\nJACOB\n45:44 \nGot it. Cool. Thank you.\nBRIAN\n45:47 \nYeah, it's funny. You mentioned solutions consultants because this is well, my role. This, we utilize this one platform for ourselves. You know, we have how to best demonstrate this tips and tricks questions. So we use it internally as well. We do use our own tool. How many you'd be surprised? How many people don't use your own tool… right? So the actual where discovery question share lives, you know, what differences you may see as you see the screen, something you may notice right away that looks a little different is these two green buttons up here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Their particular audience here is solution consultants, engineers, Automation, and consultants.\n END"}
{"prompt":"BRIAN\n53:23 \nIf you want a learning plan to be assigned to this one as well as have these courses, you can just assign it by clicking the learning plan, you already have available assigning it. And now, whenever they go into this industry knowledge, that learning plan will be available for them to sign up to.\nLearning Plans ends\nCLINT\n53:40 \nSo, question ban is then let's say I have my personas. So I have solution engineer, consultant or measuring consultant, a couple of those things, different levels throughout them to, for them to achieve their learning objectives. Would this be potentially where we would create those tracks, right? And then bring in, you know, and then assign content from the repository, but essentially create those different groups and tracks via TCS?\nIntegrations\nBRIAN\n54:10 \nCorrect. Yes. So, you create that's actually a great way to par content with discover can share if you want to kinda create these little hubs of this isn't something then created. But, you know, we pulled from a provider, we want them to exist and you want to have it to be available to everyone.\nCoach & Share\nBRIAN\n54:26 \nYou can have a channel set to whether it's very broad where it says all additional content or if you wanna, you know, minimize it to just additional solutions, engineering content. You can then pull things from the channel and then push it out into a course. Once it's in a course, you go in here. And then you can add it via assigned content.\nCLINT\n54:50 \nOkay. So.\nBRIAN\n54:52 \nAnswer your question.\nCLINT\n54:54 \nYeah. And then another use case. So, for example, we have an internal TV channel called CICTV which we have in and sort of essentially have it as a just that rather a TV channel. We've been typically uploading those episodes as courses within Docebo with a better way of creating engagement and drawing attention to those episodes that we create.\nBRIAN\n55:24 \nYeah, you can actually by, if you want to assign those links themselves to any course, you can just push through earlier in the main page here. If you have this widget, you can share the links themselves to the actual YouTube channel or sorry, not YouTube. But wherever that exists and then push it out to a channel. Or if you go where we were earlier… you can upload them into that specific channel and everyone who follows them will then get notified that. So let's say you have users by default, you know, make sure you follow this channel. You can push those, my Belden, I believe those that's what you said, you can push those out to that channel. That way they're notified, hey, new videos out, reducing that more emails that they might be getting from other sources.\nCLINT\n56:17 \nOkay.\nBRIAN\n56:22 \nIn truth, I, I'd like to kinda paint it as in like a hub for people to say, okay, I did my formal learning. Is there additional stuff that I can use, you know, that will help me do better at my job here? Or if I'm a consumer or can I learn more about all this? You can put all that content there, making it easier to kind of have a user navigate through waves and waves of content. All on the event side you'd have to do is make sure that the content is being properly assigned to the right channels, making sure those users are part of those.\nCoach & Share ends\nASIA\n56:58 \nRight? As a non technical person, I feel like I may be asking one of these meetings. But since I have Jake here, what is the technical effort needed for either of these functionalities? Like how complicated is it to switch these types of things on? Or is it like license bat, right? Like because I know you can of course, the hide views or choose who sees information, but is it license base?\nBRIAN\n57:26 \nSo in terms of getting this setup, it actually doesn't take much time on my end. The way we kind of enable. These are actually through on the back end.\nCoach & Share\nBRIAN\n57:36 \nIf you decide to go through with content and discovery question share, we flick those switches on. And then you will now have those applications within your system. This demo trial already has them. But in the admin menu, you would also get, you know, you get this discover coaching.\nCoach & Share ends\nBRIAN\n57:50 \nSo settings that will now appear and you'd have a lot more that will all be available very quickly as well as content marketplace. If you believe, Aaron, keep me straight here. If they try to access it now, they won't hit it. They won't be able to access at all, turning it on quickly. Is it takes less than a day? I'd say it would just take, you know, the configuration part is the hard part. And can you repeat the last part of your question? I'm sorry.\nASIA\n58:19 \nNo worries. I mean, as far as controlling who can see, what does that mean that it's license based? As far as, you know, like who would even have access to turn it on and have visibility to?\nPricing\nBRIAN\n58:35 \nGotcha. No. The content itself as long as that we segmented by users just because not everyone is gonna want to utilize the.\nAMANDA\n58:48 \nTo be.\nBRIAN\n58:49 \nIf I'm wrong as well, the way that CS kind of contracts work is per the monthly active users of their contract, correct? Anyone who go ahead, sir?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Clint asked how this could be done and Brian answered by creating hubs of content pulled from providers, shared through channels, or uploaded into specific channels for notifications.\n• Asia asked about the technical effort needed for these functionalities; Brian responded that it does not take much time on his end as switches are enabled in the backend menu which will allow access to Discover Coaching & Content Marketplace settings within one day.\n END"}
{"prompt":"DATHURA\nYeah, I'll just keep off real quick just so we get a Agenda and do a quick round of introductions as well. Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with us. I did get in touch with Brett and she said you'd be the best person to talk to which is great. Then we're happy to have you day with us today. Yeah, the conversation as I mentioned on email as well is just to have an understanding of your current learning projects at Teachers health and to give you an introduction of what we have to offer as well in terms of the, and see if we can help you all out in any way. Yeah, I'll just.\nPADMA\n4:20 \nAction.\nDATHURA\n4:21 \nTo…\nPADMA\n4:22 \nSo, we are a company of about 404 150 that's the number of employees, and we do use a platform called how to, which was previously called savvy. So we do have an E learning platform and we source scorm packages or sometimes we also build them in house depending on the complexity of it. But we mostly purchase our E learning modules from other sources and we just plunk it onto our LMS and go from there. So that's kind of currently what we are doing, but the pain points mainly is that how to, is not very, it's neither intuitive nor integrated. So I have to manually add every employee as they come in and go out, which is a bit of a bit of…\nMONIQUE\n5:25 \nPain.\nPADMA\n5:28 \nAnd keeping track of three. So and all our employees don't sit on one platform either. So there are dentists who are contractors. They still need to be compliant. So they still need to do some of the learning modules. And then there's the optometrist who are managed separately.\nCertifications\nPADMA\n5:46 \nSo I need to kind of talk to all three of them and say, okay, I've added you deleted you whatever. Not to one pain point is the manual process. And the second one is it doesn't really offer anything that will help me get the completion rate looking better because it doesn't do any automated reminders to say, you know, this module was allocated to you two months ago.\nCustom Reports\nPADMA\n6:14 \nYou still haven't completed it and it's for expiry or any such thing. So it's a very so I have to run a report at the end of every month and send and a department wise reports to the heads of departments to say so many are still outstanding from your department.\nCustom Reports ends\nPADMA\n6:32 \nSo could you please follow up with you stuff like that? So the place we are at right now is we do have a solution that's sort of working but we can do better. But do we, are we actively looking for something to move immediately because it's such a pain in the neck? Not really because whatever we have is for whatever in whatever Shape or form is working so, but I know that there are better things out there. So we're just in a place where we're looking to see what else is out there without not 100 percent sure if we are committed to it. But yeah, but we would definitely wanna see what else is out there.\nMONIQUE\n7:19 \nYou know, what you can't rush into purchasing a new system because you need to make sure that it's going to make not just your current needs but also your future needs. So really about understanding what your use case is and it might be that you have a number of use cases that you need to address. It's about matching those outcomes and solving the problems that you've got and making sure that it's ordered by a foundational LMS. That is gonna take you. So, one of the good things about the tab and just listening to what you were talking about and just to give you a bit of background, I've worked for a number of LMS vendors over the years would have to be one of the better ones because it can address multiple use cases.\nBranches & Groups\nMONIQUE\n8:08 \nSo you talk about those different groups. So you've got your to your dentists and whatnot, you can actually manage all of them as individual groups. But within the one platform, it'll also give you the ability to send automated Notifications out to so that it takes away all that overhead.\nBranches & Groups ends\nPADMA\n8:31 \nYeah, that's usually it's usually is like basic to do these automated reminders and stuff. So when I saw that this is doesn't have it, I was quite surprised to be honest.\nMONIQUE\n8:43 \nWell, I mean the two is probably a probably is more of an entry level LMS is probably the better way to put it. And of course, because Docebo is focused purely on learning, we've got a complete and team and we're always releasing new features and functions that our customers in for it. So you've got your Notifications so that, you know, they can be automated, the onboarding of new users and the off boarding that can be automated as well. So.\nIntegrations\nPADMA\n9:18 \nTalk to Octa.\nMONIQUE\n9:20 \nYeah, yeah.\nPADMA\n9:21 \nDoes. Okay. All right. Because in sale point, do you know?\nMONIQUE\n9:27 \nI don't know, but because we're based on open APIs, it shouldn't be an issue. But even if like we've got a number of ways that we can integrate with other systems. So we've got our own iPad solution.\nIntegrations ends\nMONIQUE\n9:39 \nWe've got, you know, prebuilt APIs. So, so, you know, we can work through that with you. But just to talk a little bit more about your users, is things like social learning important to them, so that, you know, are you trying to get them to come together as a Cohort?\nPADMA\n9:58 \nNo, I know. Look, I mean, it is, it's on our wish list but we are, I know we are quite far from it. Still. Yeah, I mean it doesn't Teachers is not, it's not too much of a learning culture yet, but we are working towards getting that more and more.\nMONIQUE\n10:19 \nYeah. So it's kind of like your future road map, so to speak?\nPADMA\n10:23 \nYeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The main pain points identified are manual processes for adding/deleting users, lack of automated reminders or notifications, and difficulty creating custom reports. \n• She has a company of 404,150 employees.\n• Padma uses a platform called How To, which was previously called Savvy. \n• They probably won't be moving on anything immediately.\n• Social learning is on their wishlist, but they are far from it.

{"prompt":"MONIQUE\n10:27 \nJust talk to me a little bit about, you know, are there any other pain points that are really driving you mad? Like talk to me about the reporting that you need to do. Like are you having to provide, are you K, peed on how many people are doing completions for courses? What does that look like?\nPADMA\n10:47 \nI mean, at the moment, like I said, it's so basic. We are only using our learning platform for the compliance side of things because of how strenuous it is to manage the platform. No one wants to use it. They're not, we're not using it for any assessments. We're not using it to really get anything out of it. So basically a compliance platform, it's not even an E learning platform at the moment. So with, yeah, if we go a little and we're struggling with just that. So because of the manual nature of the tasks, but if things go well, we would have to have like a repository of modules that people can just go to have a bit of a quick learn through, you know… at their own pace, self learning… and even join us groups like, you know, create forums and have some sort of discussions around it. We really want. I mean, if it all works out, it would be great because we are currently doing a management essentials program for all the people managers, not so much a leadership program, but more of management essentials like within Teachers, self, that are some of the things that you need to know when you are a manager, like how does the company work and stuff? So, and there is a strong need for us to have a manager's forum for example, to just bring them together and get some discussions going there. Even trainers, there's like pods of trainers across different departments. It'll be great for the trainers to come and have a discussion and, you know, share ideas and thoughts on what some of the challenges they're facing and really have that kind of space where they can do all of that. So that's all the, all of these are currently in our wish list, but it hasn't really… gone beyond that.\nMONIQUE\n12:54 \nAnd so you mentioned trainers. So are you, you're doing face to face training as well?\nPADMA\n13:00 \nWe do, we do a fair bit of face to face training. So our contact center goes through quite rigorous training for the first six months, sorry, first six weeks of anyone joining the contact center because they need to know about the Teachers, health and private health insurance and products and what not. And they cannot advise members unless they've been formally trained and signed off. Yeah. And then we also do management programs, leadership programs within the organization. There's a lot of change happening as well. So, we've been busy with some change management workshops just to get them ready for whatever is coming.\nCourse Enrollment\nPADMA\n13:43 \nSo, we do like to get in front of people. And then there's also a virtual Zoom based training as well. And then because the E learning platform is so bad, we haven't tapped into much of, you know, self paced learning yet.\nMONIQUE\n14:04 \nGot you. So with the Zoom meetings, are you, is that integrated to your, no? Okay.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nPADMA\n14:14 \nCan't even think about such things? I can't…\nMONIQUE\n14:19 \nSo…\nDATHURA\n14:19 \nI…\nPADMA\n14:20 \nRemind, let alone integrate Zoom with it?\nMONIQUE\n14:26 \nYes. Sorry. Slapped my hand… look at the, you know, some of the challenges that you're having. I'd really love to show you the platform because it will show you out of the possible. And even though you're saying that your needs are quite basic, I.\nPADMA\n14:43 \nI mean, we are, yeah, our needs are quite extensive. I'd like to say, but we are limited.\nMONIQUE\n14:51 \nSorry, yes, you're absolutely right. So, and I think one of the things that you'll see in the platform is that a lot of the pain points that you're currently experiencing, we will be able to create an, a platform for you that will grow with you as you grow like or as, you know, you get more people on board and, you know, they start really using the system. But a lot of the stuff that you're talking about, you know, is being sort of aspirational, so to speak, it's all available in the platform.\nPADMA\n15:26 \nExactly.\nMONIQUE\n15:33 \nBut it's you know, like we cover the whole learning life cycle. So, you know, from a platform perspective and being a product, you would think that, you know, it might, you might be sort of, you know, heed into a certain way of doing things and that's not the case with the platform because it's all about configuration.\nIntegrations\nMONIQUE\n15:55 \nAnd so if you're doing something that's quite complex within, you know, your industry, there will be a way that we've probably already done it before and you configure the system and, you know, we can work with you to, you know… see how we can make this all happen for you but, you know, it's you know, we do everything from, so you mentioned before that you've got that you're buying content from other providers. We do have a whole library of content that can be available to you. It is an additional cost but it can be tailored and curated for specifically your needs. Now, there will also be other content that you'll need to have, you know, specifically for what you do and how you do it.\nIntegrations ends\nMONIQUE\n16:42 \nWe do have tools that will enable you to quickly create by size like micro learning and that's all built off. So, so let's just say for example, that you've got a really data reach or word document that you need to transform into something that's really, quite appealing and people will consume closely. It's literally a drop and drag of that document into this tool. And in a couple of minutes, it will create some micro learning that you can just launch straight into the platform.\nPADMA\n17:13 \nSo what sort of offering tool is that?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Padma discussed the need for a platform to manage compliance and enable self-learning, as well as forums and discussion spaces for trainers.\n• They do some face-to-face training and zoom training. \n END"}
{"prompt":"MONIQUE\n17:17 \nIt's not an authoring tool. What we call it is a content creation tool. So it kind of the best way to describe it is it's a I based. So, so the, once you load the file up into the platform or into the module, it will read everything in the module or in the word document and then it will create it's almost like a slide deck, but it comes out like a movie real.\nPADMA\n17:42 \nYeah. Okay. All right.\nMONIQUE\n17:44 \nWe can show you that and we can even give you access to a trial environment. So you can have a bit of a play to it with.\nPADMA\n17:50 \nThat'll be great. That'll be absolutely great because I know I used to work for an to before this and I did play around with a lot of these tools. Mine marker active set to. I don't know there's just so.\nMONIQUE\n18:04 \nYeah, he's a lot isn't her and…\nPADMA\n18:06 \nA…\nMONIQUE\n18:06 \nLot of spend a lot of time learning how to use them whereas this is what we can Shape. Anyone can use it, even me. So I…\nPADMA\n18:21 \nYeah. Okay. Cool. If you could show me some of the basic things and I can go and have a play around if that's a.\nMONIQUE\n18:28 \nOkay. That's okay. So I don't have a demo setup for you today. So what I'll do is post this. I'll organize a time so that we can just give you a quick walkthrough of the platform. We'll give you access to the platform so that you can then have a bit of a play, please don't feel you're under any pressure to buy or anything?\nPADMA\n18:48 \nYeah, we…\nMONIQUE\n18:48 \nOnly here the hill. So yeah, we can, you know, we'll go at your pace. It's no problem at all.\nPADMA\n18:56 \nSure. But I know that benedett is gonna ask me this about the costing and how it works. So if you could send me some details about that as well that'll be.\nPricing\nMONIQUE\n19:06 \nSo, let me just cover that off at a high level right now for you just so that you've got an understanding before I send you anything. So.\nPADMA\n19:13 \nYeah.\nMONIQUE\n19:13 \nA, do their pricing based on monthly active users?\nPADMA\n19:18 \nRight.\nMONIQUE\n19:18 \nYeah. So you can have 500,000 people registered within the platform. We do not care the difference with us though is that whilst you got to have a minimum of 300 monthly active users, that's the minimum number that you can purchase… you can scale up to the 400, no problems if we need to. And what when we start to count, the monthly active users is when they log into the platform and they touch the content so they might start a course or they might register for a face to face event that's when we do the, but that's when we start counting, whereas a lot of our competitors will the moment someone just logs into the system that's when they do the count, that's when they start the count I.\nPricing ends\nPADMA\n20:05 \nWhat if there's someone?\nMONIQUE\n20:07 \nIn…\nPADMA\n20:07 \nThere, but they just dormant.\nMONIQUE\n20:11 \nSo talk to me a little bit more about that. So the, they haven't activated, they're not.\nPADMA\n20:17 \nYeah, because the dentists for example, they come in and they haven't really access any of the modules yet. And the other problem with dentists as they come and go.\nPricing\nPADMA\n20:34 \nSo they're with us for six months and then they're gone and then they come back for three months and then they're gone for the next 12 months or so.\nMONIQUE\n20:45 \nOkay. So we don't mind that happening because we don't you know, we don't can't, we don't can.\nPADMA\n20:53 \nOkay. So I can still go in.\nMONIQUE\n20:56 \nSo it's only when they access to the content. Yeah, and, you know, we can, and we can also show you in the demo about how you would do that so that.\nPADMA\n21:05 \nAccess the content per month?\nMONIQUE\n21:09 \nYeah. Yeah. So they could come in, say for example, that in the case of a dentist, they might come in for, they might be with you for three months. And in that three months, they touching the content in the month? Sorry, they do a whole lot of courses that's classed as one one monthly active user. Whereas if went in one month and count and touch the content once, that would be one, then the next month they come in and they would touch some like one piece of content again, just one. So that would be another one for that month.\nPADMA\n21:42 \nOkay. All right. That's quite interesting. So, and if they don't touch any content for the month, they will not be counted as a, that's quite interesting. I don't think I've come across that before just do.\nMONIQUE\n21:55 \nTo…\nPADMA\n21:56 \nDo that.\nMONIQUE\n21:58 \nFrom a vendor perspective, yeah. No. So typically, they'll say it's monthly active users, but they will be, it'll be based on the fact that everyone gets, you know, registered. And then if they just come in just to have even just a look of browse around… you know, and let's just then particularly when a new LMS is launched, you find you have like a bit of a flurry of people hitting the platform. Well, you know, you might have in your case, 400 people hit the platform in one month, well bank, you know, you've hit your…\nPADMA\n22:33 \nYou…\nMONIQUE\n22:34 \nKnow, you've hit your number. But then the other model that we see is named users. So they, so in that case, people will be registered. It doesn't matter how many times they touch the platform, you know?\nPADMA\n22:50 \nIt always is.\nMONIQUE\n22:51 \nAll the same money. Yeah.\nPADMA\n22:53 \nHow much is it… per user? Like per?\nMONIQUE\n22:59 \nIt's it's going to depend because what? And then this is another differentiator for us from a pricing perspective. Is that we only charge you the, that you'll use. So say, for example, that you just want the, you know, the core foundational learn module that might be, and I'm just gonna pick a number off the top of my head here, but it might be around about 28 to 30,000 dollars a year total.\nPADMA\n23:30 \nFour.\nMONIQUE\n23:31 \n100 users, but having said that though, as you add modules, we can then start to provide well, we can provide discounts. So don't worry about the price.\nPADMA\n23:41 \nYeah, yeah.\nMONIQUE\n23:44 \nBut there's a lot of ways that we can slice and dice the pricing too. So it might be that.\nPADMA\n23:48 \nYeah.\nMONIQUE\n23:49 \nOne, you only have say 300 users. So you start at the minimum and then in you two, you might want to ramp the numbers up because by that stage, the system as being settled in and you want to add another bit of functionality. So in you two, we might be adding, say the social aspect, so that's so the cost will increase, but we'll also have greater discounts available for you.\nNext Steps\nMONIQUE\n24:15 \nSo because you number, right? So I can talk that through with you. And, but yeah, there's lots of ways we can do it.\nPADMA\n24:23 \nThat's that's quite interesting. I haven't come across that model so far… that's good. Okay, cool. So, I think I have some time, maybe not next week but the week after.\nMONIQUE\n24:41 \nPerfect. That's perfect for me.\nPADMA\n24:44 \nYes. So the week after not the 20 seventh and not the first, but any other day is good for me.\nMONIQUE\n24:57 \nOkay. So I'll need to get my solution consultant involved in this discussion as well. So I'm going to guess at either the second or the third so that'll be the Thursday or the Friday will be one of the best days. How do you play sort of around about, say from two o'clock on both?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Monique and Padma discussed a content creation tool that can be used to create slideshows.\n END"}
{"prompt":"ALEX\n5:02 \nYeah, you can. Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah, it's a good point. Well, cool. So, yeah, tell me all about you had a meeting and it looks like you're introduced to your procurement person. So I've had some back and forth with them. So that's good. And I've I'm still waiting on the nda but it looks like it should come soon and I'm working on getting some documents to them. Hopefully, they'll come later today, just like tax forms and stuff like that. So that's moving along which is good.\nSELESTE\n5:35 \nAwesome. They moved quickly. I literally just filled this out yesterday.\nALEX\n5:40 \nYeah.\nSELESTE\n5:41 \nYeah. So there there are no questions that came out of the conversation. We wanna get pretty far along in the process. I guess one question that I'm curious about is what happens four months into the contract?\nPricing\nSELESTE\n5:58 \nAnd we start to see like, hey, we're actually leaning towards 500 subscribers. Does that become like we'll probably receive a Bill? But what does that look like from a contract perspective?\nALEX\n6:14 \nYeah. I mean, so like if you came in at 300 and upgraded to 500, you're saying, okay, yeah, I mean, so basically what would happen is like, I mean it would probably come after you launched and you would come back to the account manager.\nOnboarding\nALEX\n6:29 \nYou'd work with someone else. Like there's going to be someone post sales that you work with someone like me that will like deal with anything contracts really and just be your direct point of contract, direct point of contact. So like let's say you contact that person and yeah, yeah, we wanna move to the next tier.\nPricing\nALEX\n6:46 \nSo what would happen is basically they would give you a quote for like the next tier up and essentially like, you know, whatever time you would do that, whether it was before launch or after what, whatever they like calculate. Okay. How much did they pay? How much? If we build what's the next tier, if it's 7,000 dollars, let's say they would just yeah, like change your Bill, whatever that differences to the next tier. Like, so three to 500 it's you can think about seven or eight K from tier to tier per year. So they would just like recalculate your Bill. You would sign a new contract. You wouldn't you would do like not a full contract but like an addendum or kind of like a shorter version to commit to the 500. And then you would be build that difference on your next Bill for the remainder of the agreement like one year, three year, whatever you like sign.\nSELESTE\n7:48 \nOkay, perfect. Okay. And then also, we are looking at like a knowledge management platform and I'm trying to internally negotiate… the question is can we use the system for random knowledge?\nPricing ends\nSELESTE\n8:05 \nAnd the short answer is yes, but… are there any companies that are doing it well that, you know, that she works with? I would love to have someone in the back pocket like a client in case our workforce director wants to have that conversation because we're trying to figure out, can they live in the same space, knowledge management and learning? Do we want to separate it out? And that was kind of a request, like if we wanted to have like a conversation with a customer doing it, well, could we perhaps get in contact with someone to learn more from them? Or if you have any use cases?\nALEX\n8:52 \nLet me, let me think.\nCoach & Share\nALEX\n8:53 \nI mean, we have tons cause, you know, think of like Docebo, like it supports informal and formal learning, you know, so like the informal learning would be the knowledge management. So like you can put together pages that just have catalogs with assets or resources. Like, hey, go to this page, like we do it like for our vault, for example, I mean, you can talk to our head of sales enablement, but like they basically, yeah, you can, you know, we house like our faq docs or competitive intelligence or like we even have like our contracts in the system.\nCoach & Share ends\nALEX\n9:33 \nAnd so it's just a separate part. It's a separate page and they're just resources or I don't know what they had in mind. I guess that would be my question for knowledge management. What were they looking to? Do you think? So I can maybe think of the right client for them to speak with or the contact for? Okay?\nSELESTE\n9:54 \nSo, I think so the knowledge management platform that I'm used to working with is like get guru. And what ends up happening with platforms like that is you can literally have like engineering sprints, you can house product road maps. You can have individual personal operating manual. So that's one thing that he rolled out where each person has a personal operating manual. You can search it and you can see learn more about that person. And the internal discussion is, do we want something like that to live in an LMS? Are there any use cases of individuals who are doing it really well where, you know, they're putting in their sprints and it's not necessarily associated with learning.\nALEX\n10:43 \nYeah, yes. Yeah. The answer is yes. So let me, you know, think of who to get you with and, you know, I can make that connection.\nSELESTE\n10:54 \nYeah, I think what I think he's visual and what he's really looking for perhaps. And this is actually very by way of like, I don't know it's just like talking out.\nAbout Docebo\nALEX\n11:06 \nThat I met like the, he had a British accent? No.\nSELESTE\n11:10 \nNo, that's Anthony. So Anthony is our director of our business partners, but this is a new person that recently joined. And I think the question is we're looking at buying another platform and we're wondering like, okay, can you know, the LMS serve in this capacity?\nLayout & Content\nSELESTE\n11:31 \nWhat would a build look like from a page perspective? So we don't purchase yet another platform and we can just focus on a continuous relationship and growing the relationship.\nALEX\n11:43 \nYeah. Yeah. I mean, we can put a page together and kind of show them, you know, what that would look like, but I mean, yeah, let me do some asking because I know like I have clients that are doing it and using it for that.\nNotifications\nALEX\n11:57 \nThat's kind of thing like helpful resources and just a platform. I mean, you know, I can show you what we do for it, even have newsletters, you know, that we build into the platform and stuff like that.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Alex and Seleste discussed a meeting with the procurement person, documents to be sent later in the day, pricing for 500 subscribers versus 300, onboarding process and use of knowledge management platform.\n•Anthony is the director of business partners. \n \n END"}
{"prompt":"SELESTE\n12:12 \nThis is okay. I'll flag that for him and then I'll shoot you an email that, hey, I'll confirm like, hey, can we see a page?\nNotifications ends\nSELESTE\n12:21 \nCan I get a call together just so that he can see it as well so that they don't I think my biggest thing is I wanna make sure that we're not having like competing efforts and we can really focus on our HR tech stack and the main in a scaleable long term kind of strategy as opposed to like right now, we're thinking year, you know, do this for a year. We're gonna do this for a year, but we actually just need to implement something… for some time and trying to just kinda cut the noise from the team on like, okay, this can do this and this, you know?\nALEX\n13:03 \nYeah. I mean, I can show you quickly. You want me to me quickly, let me quickly give you like two minutes and what we do because it could get your mind going.\nLayout & Content\nALEX\n13:18 \nAnd we can show this to whoever or do much more in depth, but this is, can you see my screen the rep up? So this is what we call it the vault. This is our internal… learning platform and we use Docebo on the back end to house it. But like the, these are just image widgets. These are just, you know, custom content boxes that they made full screen. So it's like this is our February newsletter.\nSELESTE\n13:45 \nOkay.\nALEX\n13:46 \nAnd, you know, they designed this newsletter and just basically links to a Google page that they created, right? And these are like links, you know, these are new people in the organization, updated updates for mentorship.\nLayout & Content ends\nALEX\n14:00 \nThere's a link for articles on, you know, mentorship and our new product releases. You know, our calendar. They actually, I framed in a sales like a sales enablement calendar. Our sales kick off on demand. So you can find all the recordings on here. And this is a new product that we have.\nLearning Plans\nALEX\n14:22 \nSo they have just a lot of stuff in this. But like, you can kinda see, I mean, they also use it for like learning insights like, you know, here's up. So, for example, you could create catalogs, right? Your own on your learning journey, right? So it's like, you know, they've created this page.\nLearning Plans ends\nALEX\n14:42 \nThese are all images. This is just all created. I don't think there's any HTML or any CSS I don't believe, but it's like, you know, here's on collaboration, these are all catalogs. So they just did a header image. And then, you know, here's these are E learning, but these could be links. These could be PDF, you know?\nIntegrations\nSELESTE\n15:08 \nInteresting. Okay. So, it can be done, okay?\nALEX\n15:11 \nYeah, these are all tracked. You know, all this. These are informal like these are just courses you could take yourself.\nSELESTE\n15:18 \nRight.\nALEX\n15:18 \nAnd, you know, eventually like if you had the like some of these are from our content marketplace learning brothers.\nIntegrations ends\nALEX\n15:24 \nBut if you kinda go down, yeah, I mean, so that's that you can also sometimes I go in here for searching like for example, like I could just search our dpa which are our data protection agreement and, you know, they upload documents, right? So, like if I wanted to see our like this is our contract document, you can.\nCoach & Share\nSELESTE\n15:46 \nYou…\nALEX\n15:47 \nCan just download the document. You can ask people questions about the document, ask an expert comment.\nSELESTE\n15:55 \nIt's…\nALEX\n15:56 \nAll tagged, right? So, you know, this just gives you an idea of like what you could do, customer corner, you know, resources, product updates, but these are all built within the system. Yeah. And then, you know, you have a menu of like where was it onboarding, like a new hire kind of thing… customer facing resources. You know? Yeah, here we go. So this is what I'm thinking for you would have like customer facing collateral that people can download similar to like how I go, but like I could follow this channel. You know, here's a channel for all of our product. This is a learn our LMS product here's, a learning impact that you're purchasing that's…\nSELESTE\n16:40 \nYeah.\nALEX\n16:41 \nIf I want to, you know, send a customer or anything on this. I download it just, you know, this is a PDF, you know?\nCoach & Share ends\nSELESTE\n16:48 \nRight. I…\nALEX\n16:49 \nCan just view it. Could view it here if I wanted to read it or I could download right here. Yeah.\nSELESTE\n16:58 \nOkay. Okay. I'll I'm gonna scope this a little bit more with him. Go from there and let and I'll follow up. Cool. What I find there?\nOnboarding\nSELESTE\n17:09 \nAwesome. So, yeah. So things are moving which are, which is pretty good. I think I let it know the time line. I think we should be good with the time line. I'll let you know if anything pops up or the procurement team, the procurement team will take it from here.\nPricing\nALEX\n17:26 \nOkay, cool. Okay. Did she seem like she was like leaning towards a certain area? It sounds like maybe it's like, okay, let's play it safe and like move up whereas it, do you think she'd be open to looking at like a 500 user level or a three year contract? Was there any kind like, you know, discussion around a three year versus a one year that sorta thing?\nSELESTE\n17:49 \nYeah. So I flagged it with like chief of staff that, hey, I need you to also have this conversation from this angle right now. It's let's just stick with the 300 let's, stick with the plan. Let's commit, let's move forward. But while the contracts being evaluated, the beauty about it is our procurement team steps in and they start collecting information and I actually had to upload the price comparison, the business case.\nOnboarding\nSELESTE\n18:19 \nI had to upload all those documents. And from there, it goes to like our CFO and our legal team. And that's when these things will be flagged and internally discussed on what makes a little sense? So, yeah, it'll get tackled through the vendor onboarding process. And our legal team is also a stakeholder in this.\nOnboarding ends\nSELESTE\n18:41 \nAnd it sounds like from what the chief of our people, chief of staff said that it'll be flagged, it'll be discussed and that ultimately Jeff will have to make the decision, our CFO. And what makes the most sense? So, yeah. Okay. Well, we'll see what the decision is. But even like with our open sesame contract, the reason we didn't go with the multi year is because we were under the assumption that we would off board them and move to an all in one platform. So, but we needed something in the interim to get through our interview to tackle some of the things while we were trying to make a decision. So unfortunately, the timing isn't perfect, but we'll figure that out when the contract ends.\nOnboarding\nALEX\n19:33 \nOkay. And then… what was I thinking?\nALEX\n19:47 \nYou know, just… I guess in terms of like the process with like from procurement for here. So like legal is looking at it procurement is, you know, doing these forms and then… you're saying like you mentioned a business case, right? Like the, like an ROI doc or something like that. It was that something that you still need me to? Like. There is a business thing that I could put together but I just didn't know if you were putting something together on your end. I realized like, hey, I owed you something but I don't know if you still need something from me here now.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed onboarding process involving procurement team collecting information such as price comparison & business case which then goes to CFO & legal team for evaluation before Jeff makes a final decision on what is best suited for the END"}
{"prompt":"SELESTE\n20:26 \nNo, I didn't realize that the procurement team activated so quickly. So pretty much they like once I submit that vendor onboarding form, they activate and they'll ask you for everything else that they needed. But in order to even submit it, I had to submit a business case and I already had a competitor matrix that I completed because we have to shop at for different vendors.\nOnboarding ends\nSELESTE\n20:48 \nWe have to do all of that. And I was able to track down deck information and I already have the recording. So any missing pieces they'll directly ask for?\nALEX\n20:57 \nCool. Perfect. Okay. So… yeah, she, like, I don't know, I know it was a guy's name and dollar was on the, she reassigned it to a different person. Yeah.\nWrap-Up\nSELESTE\n21:20 \nOkay. Yeah. So that's our, so you're probably talking to James. So, James is activate.\nALEX\n21:26 \nJames, yeah.\nSELESTE\n21:27 \nOkay, perfect. So, James will work with tisby. She is the signer on all the docs and she works directly with brie and with the CFO to confirm things. So she'll help have that conversation internally on what makes the most sense?\nWrap-Up ends\nALEX\n21:45 \nYeah. How do you pronounce her? It's like shit.\nSELESTE\n21:49 \nTo…\nALEX\n21:51 \nHer, it's spelled SH a HZ a D, I met… she assigned the signer to her. Okay. Yeah.\nSELESTE\n22:05 \nYeah. Shazatti. Yeah. So she will be signing it. Okay. Noted. I thought it was this chazati and shazatti is the owner of quarter stone. Okay?\nOnboarding\nALEX\n22:21 \nOkay. So.\nSELESTE\n22:23 \nIn our, she's our head legal council.\nALEX\n22:26 \nCool. Okay. Well, yeah. Like, yeah, once that's signed, I can release all the security docs but I mean, so it sounds like the next, you know, steps are getting all the paperwork to procurement, getting the security stuff to you. And then where does it go from?\nSELESTE\n22:46 \nHere?\nALEX\n22:47 \nDo you… yeah, what is, I guess the press? Like will they be procurement contacting me to set up a call? Or what do you think happens from there once I get them there?\nSELESTE\n23:01 \nYeah. So after that, so everything will be done via email procurement will go through our internal process. And then the final thing is, hey, let's sign this contract… submit a Bill to our accounts payable team, but there aren't any additional calls that will take place?\nALEX\n23:21 \nOkay. You were saying something about this going to the board potentially? Is that still a thing like the, I don't know when they meet or anything?\nSELESTE\n23:31 \nNo. So the board piece was just for brie to alert them that we are intending to make this spend, but chatting with her and the chief of staff, we can just go move forward. She'll flag us if there's any issues, but she doesn't anticipate issues. So from here on now, it's just vendor onboarding and closing the contract and I.\nALEX\n23:56 \nOkay, cool. Okay. So then procurement will let us know like what the business has decided to like go with in terms of like, you know, length of contract and amount and stuff like that because it's already in your system.\nSELESTE\n24:09 \nYeah. So what happens is I've already submitted the options.\nOnboarding ends\nSELESTE\n24:15 \nThey're probably gonna go with the 300 unless someone internally challenges it additionally. So they'll let they'll be the final person that will say, hey, we're gonna a bit to this or we're gonna change it to this. So they'll communicate normally. What happens from here on out is you just ping me if you're not seeing any movement. So, when I went through this process with open sesame, they were pretty shocked because I'm out of I'm out of it. I'm out the Loop. I have no flus going on because I become, I just get an alert.\nALEX\n24:45 \nNeck. Okay.\nSELESTE\n24:46 \nBecome like a status update where it's like, okay.\nALEX\n24:50 \nGot it. Got it.\nSELESTE\n24:50 \nSo you just Loop me in along the way like, hey, you know, haven't heard anything from this person. And then I'll internally look into it.\nALEX\n24:59 \nOkay, cool. Okay. Well, so will it matter the thing about the knowledge management piece? Like if you, if the decision is, hey, we could actually consolidate things with, on the knowledge management piece.\nPricing\nALEX\n25:15 \nMaybe it is, you know, more advantageous to go with 500. Would that affect the decision on the number of users or not? Or is it just?\nSELESTE\n25:23 \nI… still probably up the amount of users, but again, our director, our VP of workforce, he's out of the office. So I'm gonna chat with him next week and just kinda get where his head is around knowledge management, what his budget is.\nPricing ends\nSELESTE\n25:41 \nAnd then if it makes sense, I can suggest like what his use case is, I don't know it just was brought up to me in passing around like, you know, I wonder, can this be used as a knowledge management system? Can you scope that a little bit more? But we're still deep in the process that we have time to change. If we need to change anything. It's just ping the contract from?\nALEX\n26:06 \nOkay. Okay.\nSELESTE\n26:08 \n500. And in fact, I think I sent you something around the contract. They'll actually request the contract.\nALEX\n26:14 \nOkay. All right. Yeah. So let me, it might be later tonight or tomorrow before I can get it to you just because I'm today's, been kinda crazy just preparing to go out but I'll get that to you. Yeah, this will be interesting. This will be fun because this will be one where I feel like there's opportunities to, you know, grow this eventually.\nOnboarding\nALEX\n26:35 \nAnd typically this goes to an account manager and you will have an account manager. But I'm going to like the they're changing around some processes here. So I feel like I still may be able to work with you on some of these other use cases like the, you know, the Talent network piece and, you know, maybe other pieces of the content piece. So it might not be typically it's like, hey, I'm working with you up until this point until your onboarding, and then you then I get like take a back seat to your team that helps you. And then you have an account manager for the lifetime, but I might, it might be you might get, you might still get me. Hopefully, I would love to still work with you after this get signed. So, but all right, cool. All right.\nOnboarding ends\nSELESTE\n27:20 \nIt's it's funny because open me is similar because we were scoping for Talent and Talent actually may end up using them for their use case. So that may happen, it'll look like a separate contract and deal on that end because they intend to sell learning plans. So that's a whole different situation. But yeah, open stuck with me for a little bit as well until they transitioned to the Talent team. So now they're finalizing what that deal will look like for the Talent network, which is really cool.\nALEX\n27:54 \nInteresting. Okay. Yeah, I would love to. Yeah, once we get into content, you know, talk through like all that we can do on that, I think it would be really cool how we can support. I mean, there are some people that like using both or some people that like go with the consolidation play but I just think you're someone that like more content could be a good thing than less, you know, a lot of section.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Procurement team activated quickly upon submission of vendor onboarding form, which included a business case and competitor matrix.\n• Vendor onboarding process is complete; James will work with Shazatti who is the signer on all documents and works directly with Brie and CFO to confirm things.\n• Procurement will decide length of contract, amount, etc., but no additional calls are necessary; board was alerted that spend would be made but conversation with chief of staff allows for moving forward without issues.\n• Ping Seleste if there’s any lack of movement in the process as she can look into it internally; VP out-of-office so chat about knowledge management budget next week to see if changes need to be made before submitting final contract/Bill for accounts payable team review.\n END"}
{"prompt":"SELESTE\n28:22 \nYou have time, no rush on the contract because technically procurement will request it.\nPricing\nSELESTE\n28:27 \nSo even early next week is fine if you can. Just so I have it on hand. I could just attach it to my file.\nALEX\n28:34 \nPerfect. All right. And it's net 60 quarterly billing, right? Okay, cool. Okay. I will do that and it's the 300 for the one year or three year… you think… and we could always change it, but…\nSELESTE\n28:55 \nLet's do the one year because she's pretty set and we're gonna do the one year, let's do the one year. I'll submit it to procurement. They already have the numbers for the three year and then I'll leave it up to them if they wanna tackle that piece.\nALEX\n29:12 \nOkay.\nNext Steps\nALEX\n29:13 \nFair enough. All right. Cool. Let's keep going. What's your schedule like next? Like… yeah, I don't know. I guess I'll just kinda update over email. I'm just trying to like, I always like to kind of like, you know, have like you like even like a check in call and just say, hey here's where we're at with procurement here's. Like what's left remaining to get to like a signature, that sort of thing. Yeah, if it's 15 minutes or something like that.\nSELESTE\n29:44 \nI think… March third will be the next week. I'm out of the office.\nALEX\n29:50 \nOkay.\nSELESTE\n29:51 \nMarch third will be really great timing because that allows the team to make a dent in everything and that's kinda the point of where we need to. I may need to, you know, ping the team. So I'm free after eight PST… actually eight 30 PST. So that's eight 30, nine 30, 10, 30 11 30 for you.\nALEX\n30:16 \nCool. You wanna do 11 30? Cool. All right. Let's do that. I'll schedule something. It seems like this does feel based on what you're saying the steps are that like it's not unreasonable to think that this could potentially get signed some time, you know, second or third week in March?\nSELESTE\n30:42 \nSo, it normally takes 30 days from the time the interaction takes place.\nALEX\n30:49 \nOkay. Yeah.\nSELESTE\n30:50 \nThe goal that's the internal sla for open sesame, it took 41 days. Okay? And that was because of process change, but I think we're down to 30 days. Okay? From the vendor onboarding process.\nALEX\n31:11 \nWell, I will, I'll put this on the calendar and see how far we got it's. Got like the fact that they got so quick is awesome that's a good sign for sure.\nSELESTE\n31:21 \nSo, I'm hoping we should be able to close this by March by like March fifteenth is the goal? Cool. So, awesome. And I…\nNext Steps ends\nALEX\n31:33 \nAwesome.\nSELESTE\n31:34 \nYeah. I see the contract group. Perfect. Awesome. And I will be in touch and let you know if there's any shifts or any changes that I hear about. I typically don't hear anything I learned from my vendor like, hey, there's been a change in the contract like, okay, like for open sesame, we ended up purchasing the whole catalog as opposed to the original terms.\nPricing\nSELESTE\n31:56 \nSo that was a change. We were originally on gonna purchase like 150 courses and they're like now let's just spend the extra money and purchase the whole catalog. So all here as a team evaluates where they land. But that's also common is they'll look at numbers and say this actually doesn't make sense. Let's go ahead and up it.\nALEX\n32:17 \nOkay. Yeah. Well, we like that. So, all right, cool. Well, the only other thing I just thought of it actually. So in the pricing, I left room for 5,000 dollars for a data migration and I realized that I haven't we haven't really scope that out. That's probably actually might be a little bit high if I don't think it's low.\nPricing ends\nALEX\n32:42 \nBut like what I do need to do is send you like a data like just a form. That all I need is to know like what you're bringing over like number of courses, number of users, if you have any enrollments, any certifications, that sort of thing. They just need to know like what stuff are we bringing over?\nPricing\nSELESTE\n33:01 \nNot much. We're bringing over users in our in about, we have 30,000 courses or actually 25,000 courses, but we're not bringing them all over. Okay? Because the intention will probably bring over 8,500 courses just to get a.\nALEX\n33:20 \nOkay.\nSELESTE\n33:21 \nBecause eventually this open sesame contract, we're just gonna give over to Talent so that's just for their needs right now.\nOnboarding\nSELESTE\n33:31 \nYeah. So like internally, we're trying to figure out the phasing out because our open sesame contract ends December and we're and we wanna go with an all in one kind of solution. So we're trying to figure out a stop point and transition point and then adding on the content and.\nPricing\nALEX\n33:52 \nOkay. Well, then I would just say then, yeah, I'll send you this form if it's 500 courses and 300 users or whatever that is. That's fine. I just need to be able to like send it internally just so I can get a definitive number and I think it's not gonna be like whatever it is.\nPricing ends\nALEX\n34:14 \nI'm just gonna keep it in that level, but just so that we can, when we put it on a contract, it's accurate. So, I'll send that over to you soon.\nSELESTE\n34:24 \nNo.\nALEX\n34:25 \nRight.\nSELESTE\n34:26 \nAll right. Well, I will chat with you via email and March third, I'm hoping that we make a lot of it.\nWrap-Up\nSELESTE\n34:35 \nI don't even know what the word is. I hope we make a lot of progress. There we go progress so that we can close everything up by March third or?\nALEX\n34:43 \nYeah, I think we will just, you know, yeah, it's a good sign from, you know, what I've seen so far and you've been great and thank you so much for the opportunity. This is going to be exciting.\nSELESTE\n34:56 \nI'm excited. Well, safe travels. And we'll chat soon.\nALEX\n35:00 \nCool. All right.

{"prompt":"COLLEEN\n17:26 \nLet me stop share because I'm gonna pull up.\nCOLLEEN\n17:34 \nA…\nCOLLEEN\n17:42 \nOkay. Re, share… send you all this to fill out, figuring we just go over this and get some questions. So for the migration data requirements, this is obviously, if you want Docebo to do any of your migration services, right?\nOnboarding ends\nCOLLEEN\n18:04 \nAnd so we will be able to like show you how you can like import catalogs during your onboarding, we can show you how to do these things. But if you want Docebo to take this off the play and for us to do this, I need this filled out. So… users Branches, I'm assuming that's not going to be relevant for the first three three things that I talked about with those are that's not really going to be relevant to you all since you're taking care of that with the SSO or with the other way. So this is what I need you to kinda dig into and see if you wanted to bring this over as far as like do you have existing catalogs that you want us to import for you? Or certifications or courses or ILT courses? It like if you can't get the most like accurate pricing, just ballpark it if you can. And that way you can get a closer number. What questions do you have on this? I know I sent it like a week ago.\nDESIREE\n19:15 \nSo, I think the questions that I have are more about how we can figure out with the records that we have. So we have historical records that we need to import. We have some of those will continue to be new courses going forward. So, I guess for me trying to figure out how, what we have ties into the language that you guys use.\nOWEN\n19:41 \nYeah. So.\nDESIREE\n19:42 \nWe know what we're asking you to do for each one of these things. Does that make sense?\nPricing\nOWEN\n19:47 \nYeah. And I think the way I was thinking about it this morning, so Mary is pulled up so much data for us thinking Mary, it looks like we have maybe 35,000 training records in our SAP warehouse or whatever you call it of that. It looks like there's maybe 3,000 or 3,500 individual courses in there. It's likely we have, I would say less than 200 actual courses we want to be facilitating going forward. However a user that's been here for 20 years still wants to be able to log in and say, okay, I'm compliant with these things. And I also took these other things in the past five or 10 years. So that's kind of where I'm at on top of how desires looking at it.\nPricing ends\nMANNY\n20:36 \nOkay. So let me help you out with a couple of things I see right now at the moment, you are using a different terminology to what we use, what you call classes is what we call courses. So there is a slight change in terminology and what you call qualification. We call it a certification, right? And so I will help you on this. And I hope the, I did it. I did do it during the demo to give you an understanding of the nomenclature that be following and how the structure is. So, the smallest unit is a training material, which will be your PDF, powerpoints documents, scorm, I, API objects, collection of these training materials is what we call a course which will be your classes, right?\nCertifications\nMANNY\n21:22 \nSo that, and then collection of these courses is what we call a learning plan. Now, if there are some courses that happen on a recurring basis or if there are some courses which act as a, you know, qualification that would fall under certifications. Okay? So if there is a training that qualifies oven to do this task, then that would be a certification, a training in which he needs to, you know, it could be one perpetual training or it could be a training that happens every six months every year or every two years in which he needs to renew his license or, and then he gets to that task.\nCertifications ends\nMANNY\n22:09 \nSo that's what the nomenclature is. And you have the option if you want to change the nomenclature, you can do that. We have a localization tool. If you want to stick to the classes and to the qualifications. All good. No problem with that. Now, how do we decide what does Docebo?\nIntegrations\nMANNY\n22:27 \nWhat can Docebo do? So, first thing is, as you said, there are some courses with that you want in your future platform, right? Which the users should be able to take. No problem. We can bring in those courses. We can also bring the content. So all the content that you want your users to consume going forward, even in Docebo, we can bring all of that.\nLearning Plans\nMANNY\n22:48 \nAnd that would fall under E learning courses that you see on the top. And you will mention the quantity of those E learning courses, how many such classes or courses you have, you want them to consume. And then within these courses, how many learning objects you have? Like as I said, it could be a powerpoint video document, PDF files. That would be the quantity that we would mention under learning objects as you can see, okay, then there is a second situation where I would say courses that they have taken which we will not be taking forward, but we do need the records. So at any point in time, if they want to see the learning transfer, they see, okay. Yes, I've done. This, I've done this and so on totally doable that will fall under E learning course and rolling, no, no, just below that. Yes, in this case, what we will do oven. And this Ray is that we will create a course shell, not the content but just the shell, a shell that would hold the records of the trainings that you did in the past.\nCertifications\nMANNY\n24:00 \nAnd given that you don't want them to take them in future, we're not importing content for these courses. We are just importing the records. So that would be the total number of enrollments you have had on all the courses in the past that you don't want to take forward.\nLearning Plans\nMANNY\n24:19 \nSo multiply your total enrollments with the number of courses you have that you don't want to take. Forward. Makes sense?\nOWEN\n24:30 \nAnd this might just be a naming thing, but most of all of our courses and most of those courses that we're talking about, our Instructor led, not you learnings that's…\nCertifications\nMANNY\n24:40 \nExactly. Then it would be ILT course enrollments open.\nOWEN\n24:45 \nOkay.\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Colleen asked the team to fill out data requirements for migration services if they wanted Docebo to take care of it.\n• Desiree and Owen discussed how they can figure out which records need to be imported and what language Docebo uses in regards to the training records.\n• Manny helped by clarifying terminology, such as classes being known as courses, qualifications being called certifications, etc., and explained that Docebo could bring content for future courses but only shells for past ones with their respective enrollments included.\n• He also clarified that most of their courses are Instructor Led Trainings (ILT). END"}
{"prompt":"MARY\n1:24 \nYeah. I mean, I believe it every time and just see if I ask him to me, you know? So I know that the, I know I remember that the last time we talked was talking about potentially creating that video and looking at the materials and I was able to glance through them immediately after the meeting. And then I haven't been able to touch them since. So we're still kind of in the same place, but I do wanna do that and we're working on… we are working on gaining, trying to sort out a few different ways to get partnerships… and get a little bit of money for the unit even through for other projects that actually, I think would also benefit from being able to use a system outside of our canvas. So I think so, I think we actually have, if we're able to put those things forward which are on the cost of being presented, it's kind of proposed then I think what we have is actually a bigger argument for being able to use a system like the CEO and then also the means or the reason to do a video and kind of present the funding at.\nCOLLEEN\n2:45 \nOkay. So we're like right there, I think.\nMARY\n2:50 \nIt's hard. It's hard to know really, but like because what we're doing is we're trying to… take do some, get some outside things going on. So we're not limited to just what we're doing inside the college and specifically with just the, what we have in the tool. Okay? Because I have not, we've not been able to get my time increased just because of the nature of the way the funding works. And what that means is I haven't been able to update and message the content the way that I want. I mean, I have 12 different ideas about things that need to happen. I haven't been able to accomplish because it's just me. So… so, you know, it has taken longer than I kind of expected, but I do think so our current purpose right now is to sort of slow down in all the things we're doing and focus on doing a few things with a little bit more strength. And in doing so position ourselves so that we can propose on, you know, some other types of funding.\nCOLLEEN\n3:59 \nStuff like that. So.\nMARY\n4:01 \nThink we're we are closer. I think that has just literally if we had talked three weeks ago, I don't think I would have said that, but we're we have some things kind of brewing that have a fair feel like they have a fair likelihood but it's hard to know.\nIntegrations\nCOLLEEN\n4:16 \nWho creates your content? Is they just you?\nMARY\n4:19 \nYeah, just me.\nCOLLEEN\n4:20 \nJust you. I don't mean, just you.\nMARY\n4:26 \nNo, it's just me.\nCOLLEEN\n4:27 \nIt's never just you. So that's interesting. So, are you looking through, how much content are you looking through? And like redoing and recreating?\nMARY\n4:40 \nI mean, so it's the kind of thing that needs to be touched at least once a year anyway… just because we evolved so much in this line of work, like our thinking has to evolve.\nIntegrations ends\nMARY\n4:53 \nAnd the way that we talk in our language move so much that we have to, I have to go back and edit a little bit of the language in there to meet the more modern standard that I had when we did it. Like we're not use, for instance, we're moving away from BI pack and moving toward a land and gt, which is… something rican let you know. I don't know, I can't remember because it's new still and then other groups targeted for oppression, right? So, so that is the new language and I have to go back and change what's in the tool to fit that, right? So, so little things like that. But I also have a lot of ideas for content and I have a lot of like types of things that we want to do that I haven't been able to do yet because they don't have the space and time to write what I need to write for it. And so, hoping to partner, one of the scholars is hoping to do work in there and do some stuff. So, I'm still hoping to get more people adding content that has just proven not to be the case.\nCOLLEEN\n6:05 \nSo, I'm going to like welcome to… the family and organization that I think that like after their official that I'll want to introduce you to because they do that. Okay? And they're well known for it.\nMARY\n6:24 \nOkay. Okay. I'll take cryptic for now.\nCOLLEEN\n6:28 \nYeah, Wednesday or official then I can.\nMARY\n6:31 \nYeah. Yeah. Signed a contract so I can talk about.\nCOLLEEN\n6:33 \nYes, and they're amazing. They're awesome. But that's what they're doing is they're helping organizations with content and how to inform people on and things like that, but it's like a, not huge organizations. They can probably definitely help you out. I thought of you when I was started talking to them actually.\nMARY\n6:53 \nYeah, that'll be cool.\nCOLLEEN\n6:55 \nAnd it's just a variety of things, right? So, maybe you just grab a couple of things and add it to your list.\nMARY\n7:02 \nYeah, that's one of the things we're trying to do is not necessarily reinvent the wheel every time there are things we want to hit harder than a lot of people, a lot of organizations will allow. But, you know, that's just us calling problems.\nCOLLEEN\n7:16 \nYeah, I understand. So as far as like funding goes, are you still waiting on to hear from like if you can get a couple of the big guys on board?\nMARY\n7:27 \nShe deal said that was.\nCOLLEEN\n7:29 \nThen it went away almost.\nMARY\n7:32 \nWe had the relationship and then she was like this is gonna be much longer term.\nAbout Docebo\nMARY\n7:39 \nWe have other, you know, we have to kind of step into that. So we're still kind of in that space. I think she's still building relationship there. She's very focused like I will say that she's… we are one of her top priorities… but she's… managing what often feel like precarious relationships in the beginning because she's talking about relatively large dollar amounts.\nAbout Docebo ends\nMARY\n8:08 \nAnd so you have to kind of like wiggle a little before. And then once you get it now, you can start once you start producing, you know, that kind of thing. So, so I think there's that, but this stuff that I'm sorry, we're starting to look for grants and external partnerships. And here we have, there's a facility… in the area that is owns that nobody really. We didn't know about that's really under utilized in that and that it is almost not utilized. And so they are.\nCOLLEEN\n8:43 \nYeah. Yeah. It's high monitor right there.\nMARY\n8:46 \nYeah. And so they are putting out, they're expecting some proposals from around the university for ways they can use the space. So we're trying to enter into that space and do some things that like again doing some things that are sort of outside of the immediate college experience and more community building and that kind of stuff that offering some other resources. So, I think if we're able to do something like that is something that I can talk to change about too is including cost of an LMS in that money that we request for that. Because I do think that we're about to, we're probably going to early next week, send off the like sort of informal proposal. And so when we do that, I wanna talk to Canada about adding that in because I think there are some moves that would be greatly assisted by something like this just by the nature of what we would be doing.

We're just meeting for the first time, but I'll give you maybe more backstory on my week than you ever hope to ask or, no. I am on going to a training conference early this week in Orlando and I live in north Georgia around the Athens area where university of Georgia is. So I've been traveling all week. And so yesterday afternoon today, I've been my like I've been out of the office all week kind of thing, got to catch back up. So it's a good Friday and I'm totally ready for the weekend.\nMIKE\n0:38 \nNice. Was that the at D conference?\nSAVANNAH\n0:40 \nSo, it wasn't a TD, it was learning magazines training conference we went as attendees and it was so cool to sit in those sessions and learn. I feel super inspired coming back. So.\nMIKE\n0:55 \nThat's awesome. You guys get some of this weird chilly weather. I'm in Kentucky… is a warmer down there for you.\nSAVANNAH\n1:03 \nWell, so it goes in and out… today. It's about 60, but it's so windy. You're gonna want like a sweater when you go outside. Have you all just been straight up chilly or are you getting a little bit of everything to do?\nMIKE\n1:17 \nI mean, you know, it's like once you get east of the rockies, it's like wait five minutes if you don't like the weather. So like yesterday, we just got hammered. I mean, literally, we probably got maybe hour, maybe two hours where it wasn't raining and there's a pond at the back of my property and it was so much water coming down that it had actually like breached over the little DAM and I was like flowing off. It was crazy. I've never seen anything like it. And then today and it was like 65, right? It's great. And then today, it's like in the thirties, I'm just like… but.\nSAVANNAH\n1:55 \nWorry soon enough. We're close enough. I think it's the same where you are. It will just be hot.\nMIKE\n2:01 \nI know, yeah, it starts warming up so you can probably tell from my accent. I'm not actually from Kentucky originally. I'm originally from California. Okay? And so I think it was like last year, it started getting real nice about like in the March and April, it was like pleasant and then it just got to humidity and I was just like, but I was in Georgia last year in may and I was, yeah, I was like all down there, you get up a lot faster than we do farther north. So.\nSAVANNAH\n2:30 \nWe do, I kind of hit that part of winter where I'm tired of it getting dark early, but then I start to get a little anxious because I know what's coming. So I'm trying to soak up all of this sitting on the back porch and not sweating within two minutes that I can get. So you got to tell me, I promise we'll talk about LMS systems, but what part of Kentucky are you in?\nMIKE\n2:59 \nLike almost dead smack in the center in Richmond. So most people know where Lexington is or they know where lowville is. So we're like about 45 Miles just south of Lexington and it's cool. It's a good little mix we have, I mean, like I can drive into town and I'll be there in 10 minutes, but on the way, I'm passing cloud pastures and I'm just like, all right, I can get behind this.\nSAVANNAH\n3:22 \nYeah. There you go. They go.\nMIKE\n3:24 \nThe other direction and it's like, you know, just farmland. We love it. So.\nSAVANNAH\n3:30 \nYeah, that's a little bit about it. It's about like that where I live too. It's like 20 minutes to town and you're gonna go all through farm land until you get there. But the reason I asked is my dad side of my family is actually from canoga, West Virginia which touches Kentucky on the Ohio river. So, my dad actually technically lives in Kentucky but they cross back and forth quite a bit. So I just didn't know if he might be familiar with like the Ohio point area, that sort of thing.\nMIKE\n4:04 \nNot that side. No, we've been to in like Cincinnati for example, and south Mike, Tennessee, Georgia and into Alabama and such, but not to not east yet.\nSAVANNAH\n4:19 \nYou guys?\nMIKE\n4:19 \nOn the list, so.\nSAVANNAH\n4:21 \nBe a place for you to head through. At some point, you might not stay here long, but.\nMIKE\n4:26 \nYeah, yeah.\nSAVANNAH\n4:27 \nWell, gosh, it's good to get to know you. I read some notes around what you're looking for and I'm excited to work with you.\nOnboarding\nSAVANNAH\n4:35 \nWhat I usually like to use today for is just to kinda like flush out anything that might make you not wanna talk to me again or besides what you wanna do next. I understand you're trying to identify some top candidates. You're not in a huge rush. You're just looking to implement in the beginning of next year. So I thought we could use the conversation to explore a little bit. I have a few questions. I'm sure that you probably do. And then by the end we'll know how to spend our time going forward. Does that, is that what you expected to?\nMIKE\n5:08 \nYeah, sure. And I mean, I think I have some more information I can pass along just in case it help address some of your questions already.\nOnboarding ends\nSAVANNAH\n5:16 \nSure. So.\nMIKE\n5:17 \nI found out today actually technically yesterday… that before I started, there had already been some decent discussions with Workday and their LMS connect their LMS system. And the quote that they initially presented was around 125,000. And yeah, to get the LMS up and running. And I don't know. I'm not sure what the renewal fee was. But the reason I'm telling you that is it was always, it was already one of those were those who are opening the checkbook. We're kinda like a little price here right then. They would expect I'm like you think that's bad? Go talk to Cornerstone. So anyway, and then the other one that we had been talking to this year is this company called health stream and they were coming in at about 110,000. And that was another one which was kind of like might be a little Rich for our blood. So I'm telling you this.\nSAVANNAH\n6:14 \nVery health center, right? So.\nMIKE\n6:17 \nYeah, it's I mean, it is an LMS, it's just that they've got, from what I can tell, it's a lot of this off the shelf content that is specific to healthcare providers and such. And then even things like some of the there's like certifications that nurses for example, or doctors have to get every year like or every other year, CPR certifications and that kind of stuff. So there was some benefits there that were attractive. But the price point I think for like I said, some of the people who are actually cracking open that checkbook might be a little bit resistant to. So I'm telling you that because I honestly don't know what the price is like where you guys come in on that spectrum. So I'm just putting out there right now like there could be some cost sensitivity, but I think we're realistic, I hope that helps.\nSAVANNAH\n7:01 \nYeah, no, that helps. Honestly, when you told me those prices, my checkbook started like cracking it eyes like weight. This isn't about me, is it? So you said you're telling me this and I actually interrupt you. You're telling me this because there might be some price is gonna be that high, tell you for sure, right?\nMIKE\n7:20 \nYeah, yeah. Exactly. And so…\nSAVANNAH\n7:23 \nWell, let's kinda cover that first. I'm fine with that. We could shortly talk about that first in the notes.\nPricing\nSAVANNAH\n7:29 \nThe one of the questions was roughly how many users, and the answer was 1,200 to 1,500. Tell me a little bit about that. Is that accurate? Has that changed?\nMIKE\n7:40 \nSo because I'm starting this process now like our user population as it stands today is only like about 650 people. Then what we're doing is this year, we're opening up several more hospitals. So that means that our population obviously isn't gonna be expanding. And so why I put that out there is because every element spender or worked with there's always like a tier pricing on, you know, how many users you have. And so shows more of just like transparency just like here's what I know.\nPricing ends\nSAVANNAH\n8:10 \nYeah. Okay, perfect. So understanding what you have today, knowing when you're actually planning to implement this is some of the Growth and then knowing that you want to continue to grow are all good things. So with the CEO, our pricing model, I think some context around that is important to understand.\nPricing\nSAVANNAH\n8:28 \nThe next part I'm gonna say, so let's say you have 650 today that grows to 1,500 to 2000. That's great. We want you to continue to grow your audiences. That means that things are successful. And the CEO, we take a monthly active user approach. So that means you can have an unlimited amount, unlimited, excuse me amount of licensed or users. So keep bringing folks in. We're not gonna charge you for every license or registration that you have. We're gonna take a look at how many folks are entering the system and actually taking training. So if they're you know, coming in every two years to do their ces or they're you know, just logging in to watch a video because they need it on the job, those are the things that are gonna make folks active. So that's actually how we'll pick your tier and we can talk a bit about your activity there, but I don't think you're going to max out 50,000 dollars at all. I'd be surprised if you did so. For example, let's say that grew and you're saying, hey, Savannah, I'm gonna have a 1,000 people, I know for sure, like they're going to be taking training and that's maybe allowing a little bit of room for those ceu folks to come back in.\nMIKE\n9:46 \nRight.\nSAVANNAH\n9:46 \nYou're looking at about a 36,000 dollar annual cost with Docebo in year one. You're going to be looking at probably a budget about 13,000 dollars for your onboarding, and we can talk more about like services or hands on support you may want. But for our general methodology for onboarding, that would be about what you're looking at.\nPricing ends\nMIKE\n10:11 \nI appreciate that.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Mike mentioned that he found out that the quote for getting an LMS system up and running was around $125,000 from Workday, while Health Stream was coming in at $110,000. \n• They discussed the user population which is currently 650 people but will be expanding to 1,200-1,500 users by next year. \n• Docebo offers a monthly active user approach with unlimited licensed or registered users so they won't charge for every license/registration. \n• Year one annual cost would be approximately $36k with an additional budget of approximatley 13k for onboarding services END"}
{"prompt":"SAVANNAH\n10:12 \nSure. No, a part of this for you. I mean, we're kind of, I'm sorry, I'm kinda bouncing around. I just wanna make sure we talk about some of those things do.\nMIKE\n10:22 \nSo, I'm sorry, I, we were talking over each other. What was your?\nSAVANNAH\n10:26 \nQuestion. I apologize.\nIntegrations\nSAVANNAH\n10:29 \nMy internet must have lagged a little bit since you mentioned health stream. I know like the thought leadership and the content that they offer is a big perk for them. I was curious if content off the shelf was something you were looking at as well?\nMIKE\n10:45 \nIt is, so, I mean just as an example, I was kinda, I was looking through like Skillsoft right yesterday and they have like some management stuff that could be of interest. But other than that, it didn't really fit with our particular use case. Why would CEO have something or?\nSAVANNAH\n11:05 \nWe do, we are, and you see, looking over here because I'm typing notes over there, we have what we call Docebo content and it's not content that Docebo is creating ourselves. We're going out and partnering with aggregators in the market. So what that means is that when you come to Docebo, you're able to access a library and we can talk about curation and all that stuff. But you're accessing content on a lot of different levels. So Professional develop elopment, leadership, sure, regular compliance, shore, healthcare specific stuff. Yes, technology specific stuff. Yes. So you're not having to like say, okay, have a leadership program. I also have this healthcare content. I have to now go out to two different providers and sign contracts. You could actually source most of that through Docebo. I say most because obviously, we don't want to talk a little bit more about what you need before I say 100 percent, we have it all, but we have quite a bit, so we can offer that through our system as well.\nMIKE\n12:07 \nSo, okay. So notes for you then, so I could see certainly an interest in like the like some of the management content, right? Usual offenders regarding anything on like preventing workplace harassment. I do have a module already on that from our good friends at Articulate. It's pretty good.\nSmall Talk\nMIKE\n12:31 \nNot California. It's is actually and they have like this incredible library of stuff. So anyway, but I'd still like to see what might be available for workplace harassment. Thank God. We're not in California anymore because that's a whole different animal.\nSAVANNAH\n12:49 \nWe have that too though.\nMIKE\n12:51 \nYeah. Run hide fight, right?\nSmall Talk ends\nMIKE\n12:53 \nLike active shooter, that kinda all that stuff. And then for healthcare, I don't know if you could share that with me now, but I would love to see what that library looks like if possible.\nSAVANNAH\n13:05 \nSure, absolutely. I could. So I'll be honest, there's so much there. I would probably for you. But what I can do after this is send you over and out just to like share more info.\nMIKE\n13:17 \nYeah, that's perfect.\nSAVANNAH\n13:19 \nOkay. Now we've jumped right into that stuff. I would say if you're gonna be interested in content that's an additional module. Obviously we are partnering with these folks. So it's an extra like product. But even with content, you're not gonna be, I would say, let me just make sure I'm giving you the right price.\nPricing\nSAVANNAH\n13:39 \nYou're not going to be around 10 on the prices of those other folks by any means. I would say as long as you have at least like maybe you know, an extra 35,000 dollars to spend there, you can get into some good content. You'll probably find that if you go out and look at content independently, you'll probably find that price range to be pretty similar there.\nPricing ends\nSAVANNAH\n14:03 \nSo… I'm skipping over some of the other stuff I wanted to know. We went right into that. And I'm actually curious though I looked at your organization and I'm curious about who these folks are that you're training, tell me a little bit more about them. It seemed like you partner with facilities and professionals. So I just wanted to hear about how it works and who your training.\nMIKE\n14:27 \nYeah. Sure. So… so we have like our operations team, right? So that would technically be like me, we're HR, right? But the biggest group of learners is going to be on our clinical side. So these are literally going to be like the nurses, the doctors even like maybe like facilities management, people, housekeepers, cooks, people who are actually working within our rehabilitation hospitals. And so we have certain criteria that we have to match. We have to meet every year so that we can keep our creditation… and thus operate. So that's the clinical side I'm still learning about is I've never worked in healthcare before, but I know things are there's like certain training like how do you, how do you safely transport or transfer a patient from? Say we'll share to a bad as an example there CPR nurses apparently have to do like cause every year or every other year, whatever it is. So those are the kinds of things where we would either in some cases, if we offered it as like any learning module or even if it was like Instructor led, it doesn't matter, you know, whatever it is that just people know where to go and get themselves scheduled or take the module or what have you.\nIntegrations\nMIKE\n15:43 \nAnd then of course, the reporting out of the system, it's all pretty much straightforward LMS stuff. It's just that it's for healthcare. So all the shelf content like a look a little. They're a little different than other.\nSAVANNAH\n15:55 \nYeah, I'd say something Docebo is gonna be really strong and supporting you on is uniquely serving those different folks within your one Audience, right?\nIntegrations ends\nSAVANNAH\n16:06 \nSo you have these folks working in your facilities, but your doctors may not need the same things your nurses need, may not need the same things that the folks working in the cafterias, need. So we're going to be able to bring what's relevant to each sub Audience for you in a really easy way and even set different parameters around like, okay, nursing, ces, doctor, CS, and push people into the right things.\nIntegrations\nSAVANNAH\n16:30 \nAnd based on who they are, I know you mentioned a connection with Workday. I imagine that must mean they're your HR system.\nMIKE\n16:39 \nYeah, exactly. And so I don't know, I'm just knowing Workday, I'm sure they're probably charging for the, you know, API access every year. But what I, what I'm trying to avoid is getting into an LMS provider who then says, and then we're going to hit you on the other side too. And I don't know if that's like the sales model or not or.\nSAVANNAH\n16:59 \nNo, it's not our model. Workday will often say when they're selling their LMS, nobody can do it like we can, you're not going to be able to integrate. You are going to be able to integrate? I can say that confidently. We have a Workday app and I'll be honest, I'm not, I don't work with it every single day because Workday tends to be more popular with, you know, organizations like yours are really large organizations, but we do have it and I can get you as much information as possible on it, but it's designed to take that problem completely away where you're not having to struggle with, you know, trying to connect to things that don't want to connect or we're going to be able to make it smooth for you in regards to like passing data back and forth getting your users into Docebo and mapped into the right roles, that sort of thing. So… let me make a note of that.\nIntegrations ends\nSAVANNAH\n18:06 \nSorry, I'm like typing furiously over here. My fingers never move so fast.\nSAVANNAH\n18:15 \nOkay, perfect. Got it. I just realized I looked up and I was like that is not spelled right? I'm not gonna know what that means later. When I read this again. Any questions around any of that? I know what some?\nIntegrations\nMIKE\n18:29 \nYeah, yeah, this one might be more of like a.\nSAVANNAH\n18:33 \nYeah, like…\nMIKE\n18:34 \nA sales engineer question. But I'll see what you can run into. So I was looking at the video on the connection between the CEO and work Workday. And to me it looked like a Workato recipe. And so what I'm curious about, you know, the video course marketing is like, it's so easy. You don't need this deep type experience and such. And so what I'm not sure of is, you know, I'm like, okay, is this really that easy? That guy like me who's savvy, but I'm not, you know, I'm not building Workato recipes every day, right? Like is it something that really is that easy to configure or is it something where it's like we're just kidding actually it's better to get some Professional services on that.\nIntegrations ends\nSAVANNAH\n19:21 \nThat's a good question. So, and it is something I'm gonna run back through my team but here's my understanding of it… Workday you're you've already called it. They make it kinda hard to integrate with other things especially LMS because they have one that's a huge problem for us, right?\nIntegrations\nSAVANNAH\n19:41 \nBecause if we have all these clients that need this and we can't deliver well, that's not great because Workday is a huge HRIS provider. So, yes, our CEO connect product is powered by Workato. And in a typical sense, if you were to buy that connector, you would need some experience doing that, right? But what we did is we went in and prebuilt some of them to service you in the easiest way. So with this one specific, I'll just go ahead and be honest. Usually, I'm working with some other connectors and I can answer them more easily. Me working with this one, I'm gonna have to go ask because I believe we've made it where it's more plug and play for you. Since this is such a big question that we get asked, we've developed it to be where, okay, Mike, you don't necessarily have to do all this hard work to stuff. We're gonna have it more plug and play for you. So allow me to go ask the question, but I think that's what we've done with this specific connector.\nIntegrations ends\nMIKE\n20:41 \nYeah, cool. And I would kinda expect that to be the right answer there. I mean, I know we don't have anything that's like so far out that it's impossible that, you know, I would expect something to be more out of the box. I…\nSAVANNAH\n20:54 \nThat's what we tried to deliver on there.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Mike mentioned his interest in Workday integration, which Savannah assured him was possible with a prebuilt connector that requires less technical experience. \n• Mike also indicated an interest in workplace harassment prevention content END"}
{"prompt":"MIKE\n20:56 \nYeah, yeah. Obviously the usual Automation stuff where it's like build a new profile, get them in the right organization and then sync completion data back into an Workday, right? Nothing.\nSAVANNAH\n21:10 \nI didn't expect you might have anything earth shattering there and we've really tried to address like those general actions that folks really wanna take to keep moving. And you kinda called all of them out right there. So I have that on my list to just get you some clear answers on. And if you want to get back together after this call, it's something we could go ahead and talk. It's important, right? So we could go ahead and about it. Let's see. I'm kinda taking a peek at some of the other questions that you have. You mentioned having learning path in a competency framework?\nMIKE\n21:50 \nRight. Yeah.\nSAVANNAH\n21:51 \nMorning 38 tell me about that kind of competency and how you want to set that up.\nMIKE\n21:56 \nYeah. So.\nSAVANNAH\n21:58 \nI get, I gotta giggle out of you on that one day. I.\nMIKE\n22:01 \nYeah, yeah, no. So because I've been doing some digging into this just literally the last couple of days. And the way if you were to ask an HR person what competencies are is completely different than what clinical person thinks of them. The way I'm looking at them is probably more in the HR terminology, which is like long 37 38 or whatever it is. And they're kind of like it'll be a generic statement. And then here's like the behaviors that you might observe somebody doing. And if they're demonstrating these behaviors in a certain way, it's like, okay, this is somebody who's you know, doing, you know, what's expected if you will. But the on the clinical side, it's thinking about let's say if you were a licensed practical nurse or LV or whatever. I license vocational nurse today, and you wanted to move into becoming a registered nurse in a year or something like that. And so going, okay, what in our content library might be helpful to get that person from point a to point B? And so just the idea of being able to maybe like outline what a learning path could look like… or if I take more of the classical HR perspective, which is okay, I'm an individual contributor today, but by tomorrow or not tomorrow, but, you know, I'm working towards moving into management or some kind of supervisory level. And then it's more of like, okay, well, then you need to be able to have like performance conversations with employees and you probably have good report with these people. So you have to understand what it means now that you're their boss but having things that are lined up and easily identifiable for people or at, you know, for performance evaluations or something manager or director can look at what's what the person who's completed and populates in Workday. So we're not sending to different systems say, okay, here's the learning that you've gone through. Okay, I see where it lines up with whatever the competency is. So it's nice and clean. And again, I don't know if that's something that I don't even know if that would work with a Workday connection per SE. But that's kind of what I was curious about.\nSAVANNAH\n24:22 \nOkay. I think it would, but I think it's something we should walkthrough in a demo. So I'll tell you high level because I don't believe I'm leaving people hanging like, yes, very cool. I'll show you next week. We have this module and of co, we call it skills.\nBranches & Groups\nSAVANNAH\n24:42 \nBut essentially, what you're doing is your naming a role like nurse or RN or something of that, you know, nature and you're assigning skills that should be associated to that role and you have flexibility in terms of what you want that to be. So that could almost be like your competencies, they can add some themselves, their manager, director, supervisory role could also add some.\nBranches & Groups ends\nSAVANNAH\n25:08 \nAnd they're rating themselves on where they're at and their managers also rating them. So they're getting this back and forth thing going. But where the actual learning plans and paths come in and courses that you can assign skills to those as well. So what you're essentially doing is saying, hey, you're in our and bedside manner is something that you need to work on. It's a part of this overall competency. You could tag that to all of those and surface those back to that person based on what they're working on. And that is the kind of data that you could pass back to Workday if you wanted to. No, that was almost like to close your eyes and walk with me kind of thing. But I don't…\nMIKE\n25:52 \nYeah, no, no. I mean, I, I'd say lines are pretty close with what I'm thinking here.\nSAVANNAH\n25:58 \nYeah, that might get close. And I think, yeah, when we kind of walkthrough and see it, we can discover a little bit more together there.\nMIKE\n26:05 \nIt relatively straightforward. So there's always, I mean, it may be done automatically with, well, usually is done during implementation anyway. But if for some reason we decide, okay, we're not gonna deal with this competency thing yet. Is it as simple as, you know, six months down the road, I could put together like a CSV sheet and upload it into Docebo and build out everything for me like the competencies or whatever it may be that kind of stuff?\nSAVANNAH\n26:33 \nYes.\nMIKE\n26:34 \nThat's straightforward.\nSAVANNAH\n26:35 \nIt is, it's that straightforward. We also have a I there with specific competencies like the one that you mentioned longer. Is that how you're saying it?\nMIKE\n26:47 \nThat's correct? Yeah. So.\nSAVANNAH\n26:49 \nLike with longer or is probably not gonna still suggest that you're gonna have to create it, but there might be stuff that's more general kinds of skills that it could suggest as well.\nOnboarding\nSAVANNAH\n26:57 \nSo you can take away stuff like that. So we have elements there to help you and make it easy. But yes, if you wanted to set that up down the road, you can and you're not gonna like lose support once you're live, Mike. So if it's something you wanna take a peek at and even talk with our team about the best way to kick that up and get it started and be strategic about it, you can have that conversation with us. So we're going to be there to support your success along the way.\nOnboarding ends\nMIKE\n27:24 \nCool. Okay.\nSAVANNAH\n27:26 \nYeah. I just picked at the clock. I feel like I've learned a lot. The main thing I wanna know because I wanna make your life as easy as possible is what I know you're mentioned talking to Absorb in 360 as well, Workday and health stream. We're a little high on their cost, maybe a lot of high on their cost. What do you need to identify those top candidates? And now I wanna put these folks in front of the rest of my team?\nMIKE\n27:56 \nYeah. So… I would say right now probably… I think part of it is maybe some of the personalities involved, but health stream has been kind of sitting at the top simply because it is so specific to healthcare.\nIntegrations\nMIKE\n28:14 \nAnd I think because the person who's got the biggest stake in it is familiar with it anyway. So what I feel like could end up giving some competitive advantage if you will, is seeing like what does that healthcare library look like? That? The shelf healthcare library? Like what's involved in that, which we already talked about… pricing wise?\nPricing\nMIKE\n28:37 \nI mean, I think… I don't know that anybody has officially said no, just some of the higher prices, right? But I feel like if we were coming in and we're like, hey, you know what? We're going to be able to get this thing up and rock in first out of the gate. Let's just say it's 100 grand and that's because we got all the super nuts implementation and all the, you know, maybe there's some Professional services that's involved, right? But then after that every year, like you said, if the renewal fees or something like 35,000 or 50,000 or whatever it is.\nPricing ends\nMIKE\n29:08 \nThose are things that are obviously attractive because I really know with both health stream and Workday, it's expensive every year. You know what I mean? So.\nSAVANNAH\n29:21 \nSo like good value?\nMIKE\n29:23 \nYeah.\nSAVANNAH\n29:24 \nNo value to be competitive at a cost that makes it a little bit more of a no.\nMIKE\n29:28 \nRight, correct. And then, I mean, just already from seeing doing my personal previously Docebo versus what Workday offers workdays like from a UI perspective, it's like, I don't know Docebo is a little more splashy. I think it's gonna, I feel like it's a little more engaging in some ways and a little easier to look at.\nSAVANNAH\n29:50 \nI would agree. I would agree. I know I work here, my God, I know I do. But yes, you're right?\nMIKE\n29:55 \nIt's just, it's intuitive. I don't know work in kinda like… anyway.\nSAVANNAH\n30:01 \nI'll tell you my take. I got, I know I'm a salesperson. Okay. I probably shouldn't say this. My take is Workday, you're right? Like it's too HR centered to and it doesn't make a big enough splash. Absorb in 360, they're newer on the scene. We usually see people come back to us from them once they like continue growing. If we lose to them health stream, it can be hard. I'll just go ahead and throw it out there to you because they have so much thought leadership around specific, really niche things in… healthcare. Folks are scared to miss right there's. Too much risk associated with missing those things and health stream. They do that really well. I'm just going to be honest with you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Mike and Savannah discussed automation, competency frameworks, learning paths, and the cost of different platforms.\n• Mike mentioned that Health Stream has been sitting at the top of his list due to its healthcare-specific library.\n• Savannah suggested Docebo as it is more engaging from a UI perspective than Workday's HR centric approach.\n• Absorb in 360 was also discussed with regards to their thought leadership around niche things in healthcare but with high risk associated if missed by users. END"}
{"prompt":"MIKE\n30:48 \nI know. So.\nSAVANNAH\n30:50 \nThat's that's my view. Like, I think where he can come in is having a good value and a good price. If you put us next to health stream in terms of thought leadership around like what they do with like, hey, see use for surgeons change this year. Like I'm gonna tell you all about it. We're not gonna have that knowledge.\nMIKE\n31:14 \nYeah.\nSAVANNAH\n31:15 \nThat's where that gap is gonna be between us and health stream. And then the others, hopefully, you'll probably see those as we jump deeper into the product, but that's just me being 100 percent transparent.\nMIKE\n31:26 \nNo, I get it. I'll…\nSAVANNAH\n31:31 \nYeah.\nMIKE\n31:32 \nI mean, just from doing some research.\nSmall Talk\nMIKE\n31:34 \nSo actually fortunately, so I'm heading to our home office next week, sitting with my boss and we're gonna talk with health stream. She's in the same place I am too, which is like let's just pick the right provider before we get anchored in one thing. You know what I mean?\nSmall Talk ends\nMIKE\n31:50 \nSo that's good. But anyway, so, but I think that's it. I mean, I don't know, I just have a different perspective because I come from a learning background.\nSAVANNAH\n31:59 \nRight. Well, we'll work together. If you wanna take a look at Docebo, I think here's what our next steps should probably be. Let's get into the platform. I want to show you like a full demo so we can dive into and talk more about these things that matter to you. And then I think if you're liking what you're seeing, I'll put together a price proposal that you could take back and we'll also take a bit of time to talk through about like the, what is or any questions recording. So you feel like super confident in it. And then we'll take it from there. But the only other thing I would ask is Mike keep just letting you know what you need, like what you're up against and, you know, what questions are really gonna matter and I'll get you what you need on all of them. So that's how I think we should approach it. Do you agree?\nNext Steps\nMIKE\n32:52 \nYeah, no, that's perfect. I think that's a great next steps.\nSAVANNAH\n32:55 \nOkay, perfect. When do you want to see a demo? I guess that's the last question.\nMIKE\n33:01 \nNext week is gonna be kinda sketchy. So I'd rather not over commit myself.\nSAVANNAH\n33:07 \nAdd us to it.\nMIKE\n33:09 \nYeah, I know. So how about the week of the 20 seventh March first for me is wide open?\nSAVANNAH\n33:20 \nIt's looking really good for me as well. I am around between nine and 11 30 a. M or between three and five that day.\nMIKE\n33:33 \nHow would 10 am eastern do for you?\nSAVANNAH\n33:36 \nI would work, and I usually like to hold an hour to give us enough time to be thorough and it's not just a presentation. You know, it's a conversation. So just all the stops for you. Does that work?\nMIKE\n33:48 \nYes, perfect.\nSAVANNAH\n33:49 \nAll right, perfect. I'm gonna go get to work. I wanna give you, I might not get it over today early next week. I want for you to have a really good idea of our Workday connector and I want for you to feel like you have a pretty good grasp on what kinds of content you can get from DC. So I'm gonna put a prep for our demo. Does that sound good?\nNext Steps ends\nMIKE\n34:20 \nYeah, that's great. And then I don't know if this is even to be part of it or not. But like, I really like, I don't need to see like a slide deck and all the logos and all that kind of stuff.\nSAVANNAH\n34:30 \nFor…\nMIKE\n34:32 \nYou already have some trust, you know what I'm saying?\nSAVANNAH\n34:34 \nYeah, let me tell you. I hate slides as recording. I really hate slides and I know that the second I show them, people TUNE out that's why I like this conversation because what we talk about, I'm taking notes on it and I know what matters to you based on what you told me. So we're gonna get right into the demo.\nWrap-Up\nMIKE\n34:55 \nPerfect.\nSAVANNAH\n34:56 \nYes, if you ever do need sides for me to make like a case to folks, you just let me know because just know as a default, I'm not bringing any.\nMIKE\n35:04 \nGod, thank you. You're well.\nSAVANNAH\n35:05 \nWelcome. The only time you'll see ones on your pricing table because it's prettier that way. So I'll do that on a slide but that's it cool. Well, I'll send that out. You have a great weekend. Thank you. You'll hear from me next week. No pressure to respond because I'll see you the week after. But if anything changes in between now and the demo, just let me know if we need to adjust.\nSmall Talk\nMIKE\n35:28 \nI appreciate that. Thank you so much. If you doing anything fun this weekend?\nSAVANNAH\n35:32 \nThis weekend, I think we're going to do a little bit of relaxing. It's a long week of flying and stuff and I'll tell you we moved into a new house. We built a house this year.\nMIKE\n35:45 \nCongratulations.\nSAVANNAH\n35:46 \nThank you. Thank you. I hope this part makes you Google. We ran out of budget for the landscaping. I…\nMIKE\n35:53 \nAwesome.\nSAVANNAH\n35:54 \nWe'll just do it in the spring. Well, the spring is not all. Be here. So I'm gonna try to do some plant planning.\nMIKE\n36:03 \nYou now that's great.\nSAVANNAH\n36:07 \nI…\nMIKE\n36:07 \nLove hearing that. It's fantastic.\nSAVANNAH\n36:10 \nIt's it's fun now. I'm kinda like I wish I kinda would have just done it earlier, but it felt good to save the money. What about you? Anything fun?\nMIKE\n36:19 \nTomorrow is just got any last minute laundry done and getting packed. And then I'm flying on Sunday. And then tonight, my wife and I are just gonna go have dinner with the end law. So nothing fancy. Hopefully, I will be able to sneak in some time to do a little fishing. We'll see how it goes.\nSAVANNAH\n36:37 \nWell, I'll send good weather, but your way… safe travels, enjoy dinner with your MS and your wife, and you just let me know if you need anything from me, but I hope you have a really good weekend.\nWrap-Up\nMIKE\n36:51 \nAppreciate that. All right. Seven. I'll see you two weeks.\nSAVANNAH\n36:55 \nAwesome. Yeah, pleasure to meet you, Mike, chat soon.\nMIKE\n36:57 \nAs well bye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Mike and Savannah discussed the gap between Health Stream and their own product in terms of thought leadership.\n• Mike is heading to his home office next week to talk with Health Stream, but he wants to pick the right provider before getting anchored into one thing. \n• Savannah suggested that they should get into the platform for a full demo so they can dive deeper into topics that matter for Mike and put together a price proposal if he likes what he sees. \n• They agreed on having a demo at 10 am Eastern time on March 1st which will give them enough time for thorough conversation about any questions or concerns Mike has about Docebo's Workday Connector, content from DC, etc.  END"}
{"prompt":"KILEY\n0:00 \nHey, John.\nJOHN\n0:01 \nHello?\nKILEY\n0:03 \nHey, how's it going? How are you doing good? It's been a little bit. How have you been?\nJOHN\n0:08 \nGood. How are you doing?\nKILEY\n0:10 \nGood. Good. All good. It feels like yesterday was Tuesday and now we're already at Friday, it's kinda crazy.\nJOHN\n0:17 \nHow that works?\nKILEY\n0:18 \nYeah, this week really flew by what?\nSmall Talk ends\nJOHN\n0:21 \nIt's really Tuesday. Sorry, except when it's really Tuesday and then you step.\nKILEY\n0:28 \nI know. I like it this way better. Hello, everyone. Welcome in.\nKEVIN\n0:34 \nI you.\nKILEY\n0:34 \nHello? Hello. All right. Let me make sure we have everybody here. Yeah, we have four people on your side. Yeah, awesome. Well, happy Friday. Everybody.\nKEVIN\n0:44 \nYeah.\nKILEY\n0:45 \nUsually, you know, no one wants to work on Fridays, but here we are at the kind of end of the day, mid day, whatever time zone that you're in. So, thank you to everyone for joining today. And good to meet all of you. I know we have some new faces on the call, so I will just kinda kick us off with an introduction from our side.\nOnboarding\nKILEY\n1:04 \nMy name's Kylie, I'm an account executive here at Docebo. I've actually been working with John since around the October time frame. I think that sounds right. And he's really uncovered a lot of areas of opportunity that we've dug into over the past months following up from October. I also have two others on my side from Docebo, Danny and Chris. They are here to support me in the technical side of things. Chris. If you want to introduce yourself.\nOnboarding ends\nCHRIS\n1:32 \nYeah, good afternoon, everybody. Chris, fail and solutions consultant at Docebo. So I work with Kyle to make sure we're looking into your business needs for an LMS going through as many of the technical things as possible. And then with me is also Danny from our solutions architect side.\nSmall Talk\nKEVIN\n1:50 \nGreat. Well, Chris, feel free to, you know, rip into a guitar rip, whatever you.\nKILEY\n1:58 \nHRIS, Chris. Well, I'll count on you, buddy, go.\nKEVIN\n2:06 \nYeah, I'm Kevin Boyle, I'm director of it been a ski about five plus years and a couple of years before that consulting and John, in the last month or so, we've been chatting about you guys.\nSmall Talk ends\nKEVIN\n2:20 \nHe's been catching us up. Sounds like… he's pretty excited about your functionality. And now he's coming back around us and it's like, well, we need to figure out how that's gonna work with everything else that's pretty much the reason why we're here. So, I'll let the rest of the team introduce themselves. But basically, we're not here to qualify whether you're the best tells out there. We're here to help figure out how it's gonna work if that's where we go.\nKILEY\n2:51 \nAbsolutely. Thanks Kevin. Great to meet you. Thank you.\nWILLIAM\n2:55 \nI'm hi, I'm will mccomb, I'm the director of digital transformation solutions. I've been with S, ti for a year and a half right now. As an employee. I was a consultant prior to that for a bunch of years on the accounting software side.\nKILEY\n3:11 \nHi.\nMICHAEL\n3:12 \nI'm Mike, boom and I'm our lead developer here at st, I've been here about six years and, you know, as Kevin said, we just have some questions just to make sure that we can get some functionality that we're expecting.\nKILEY\n3:24 \nAwesome. Yeah, thanks for that, Mike. Yeah. And really the point of this call is to ask us anything you wanna throw at us. Usually if it's just me, I would feel a little overwhelmed because I wouldn't have the masters on the call, but we do have Danny here and Chris and they're on the more technical side. So, whatever kind of questions you wanna throw at us, feel free, but we are here to answer anything and everything. I know we have 30 minutes on the clock. So, whoever wants to start the floor is yours.\nKEVIN\n3:49 \nYeah. Well, if you had an elevator speech as a technician, Chris, what would you wanna catch us up? Because we really haven't had a chance to honest to get to in the weeds with your product?\nIntegrations\nCHRIS\n4:05 \nSure. Yeah. So Docebo is in a restful API platform giving you a lot of access to a lot of the different areas inside of the platform. You get to very easily where we really shine in our marketplace is our ability to host multiple audiences for you in a dynamic fashion.\nLayout & Content\nCHRIS\n4:25 \nSo if you're coming in as a technician or from sales or it, whatever the case may be, we can really make sure that your experience differs from your colleagues based on your credentials as you're coming in so you can really design learning around your specific audiences and then track that very easily.\nLayout & Content ends\nKILEY\n4:46 \nChris.\nCHRIS\n4:47 \nThat works.\nKEVIN\n4:48 \nJust going off on the fifth floor, we're good.\nCHRIS\n4:50 \nOkay.\nKILEY\n4:52 \nWe're there.\nKEVIN\n4:55 \nSo, Mike, you're probably the closest to the, to the current applications, anything from an integration point, maybe we could just kinda kick off and chat a little bit with these guys.\nWILLIAM\n5:06 \nSure.\nMICHAEL\n5:07 \nI think one thing that's definitely important for us is single sign on. So we wanted to just verify that if we could use single sign on preferably with like a two, you know, so that our customers can, you know, log in with access S, ti, which is our portal into.\nCHRIS\n5:31 \nSo I'm a, Danny take that one a little newer to me. But I think short answer is yes.\nIntegrations\nDANNY\n5:39 \nYeah. I know I'll be more than happy to expand upon that. So definitely like that we can use to the ones is on your side however to provision the clients using the API calls because you're going to provision are calls. And the other one too is it's very atypical of our clients to use JWT token bearings to do the authentication. So I'm not too sure if that's your scenario, but that's one of the methods of sharing keys. That way we have the authorization between the two sharing platforms, communicating with the same pair keys. Once that's established in any of the API calls that are available in the vast library as Chris had mentioned is available to you to do the provisioning from that perspective that we do have standard portals as well.\nIntegrations ends\nDANNY\n6:24 \nSAML, an open ID as one of the other conditions. I think since it is on top of OS two, you could use that if your ID P is configurable for an S to slash it provisioning exercise, which is a little bit more easier because you just configure it and map all your arnica structures to our structures and SSO is done automatically via that. So.\nBranches & Groups\nMICHAEL\n6:47 \nOkay, awesome. And then…\nWILLIAM\n6:49 \nKnow this.\nJOHN\n6:51 \nI have no idea what was just said in the last 60 seconds. So that's hilarious.\nKILEY\n6:55 \nI don't either.\nMICHAEL\n6:58 \nAnd one other thing is like in the current platform, you know, we do separate users into groups… you know, based on whatever courses we do show them and things like that. Well, we have an automated way of doing that. If that's even how this works yep.\nDANNY\n7:16 \nNo, absolutely. So part of the SSO, where regiment is that we have a article structure both from a horizontal and vertical perspective. What I would define as our horizontal is what we call Branches which is a very one two, one match from a structure of a hierarchy. And then we have a group which is across, right? So if you belong to two points in the hierarchy, you can use a group provisionary role, right? Which puts a person or an individual in two Branches, as we would say, right? Otherwise, if it's just a single branch and whatever that branch is associated with. And thank you, Chris, you're pulling that up wherever branch is associated with a course. That person will automatically get enrolled in those courses based on how we, you know, do the, you know, role based control in the back end and that's how it would work in that way?\nMICHAEL\n8:07 \nPerfect.\nCHRIS\n8:09 \nAnd this can be very part of the dynamic solution as well. So while the Branches and sub Branches are kinda the hard way we really put people in organizations and everything, we can have it very flexible at the same time with this other concept of what we call groups where these are people that can belong to different Branches and sub Branches. But they do have something else in common such as I'm in onboarding right now. And as an automated process, I get given my onboarding content. And once I'm done with that, a new rule can take over. And if I'm going into a specific job title, that can be the next role.\nCertifications\nCHRIS\n8:44 \nBut then puts me in a different group and gives me my new content. So this can really change over time with them.\nMICHAEL\n8:52 \nThat's cool. One other thing is… okay. Well, so obviously, you said you're a restful, you have a restful API. So I'm assuming that if we were to want to ever, all, you know, whether either users courses that they've taken or certificates that they've earned and show that on our website, we'll be able to do that.\nCertifications ends\nDANNY\n9:18 \nThere's definitely a library for the certification or sharing as we would call it. And you can pull all the data points that you would want to, you know, throw on your side, some examples if I were to use is like using credible as one where we would send the information. And incredibly, we transform that data into, you know, icons and badges for people to view on a website or LinkedIn. Learning is another one. Sorry LinkedIn in general, we have a connection through that as well where we send credentials and everything else through those means which is behind the scenes using APIs as well. So.\nMICHAEL\n9:51 \nSo we do use cradle for the digital badges and with the platform actually handle issuing those badges.\nDANNY\n10:00 \nYou would have to match the badges. So credle has the badge ID and the badge icons and so forth. We can exchange, you know, icon pictures if you will. However we can send the data points about who achieved a certain credit.\nIntegrations\nDANNY\n10:12 \nAnd then cradle, we take that information and then, you know, associate the proper badge and the ID and everything else and keep that library of information on the credly side, right?\nMICHAEL\n10:22 \nRight. Would we have to build that integration to have that work or is that already like built into this platform?\nDANNY\n10:28 \nYeah, that's a diy not out of the boss.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kiley, John, Kevin Boyle (Director of IT), William McComb (Director of Digital Transformation Solutions) and Michael Boom (Lead Developer at STI) had a conversation about Docebo's platform.\n• Chris from Docebo explained that the platform is restful API giving access to different areas inside it and can host multiple audiences dynamically.\n• Danny discussed SSO using 2FA as well as JWT token bearings for authorization between platforms by sharing keys. \n• Branches & Groups were discussed with regards to regiment in the hierarchy structure while Groups are used for people who belong to two points in the hierarchy or have something else in common such as onboarding content or job titles which would change over time with them. \n• Certifications was also talked about where Credly has badge IDs and icons associated with it but data points on who achieved certain credits need to be exchanged through APIs which needs integration work done by DIY methods not out-of-the box solutions offered by Docebo END"}
{"prompt":"MICHAEL\n10:32 \nRight. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Great. I think that's really all I had. I guess one other thing that will and I were talking about was if we, if there's any easy like Salesforce integrations or anything like that?\nDANNY\n10:47 \nWe do have an option. It's called the manage package. It's a little bit of a extraordinary measure because the manage package, what it is, it's built on Salesforce apex commands and it actually embeds to, in Salesforce platform. So you don't have to leave ideal for a sales department, right? But if it's both external internal facing kind of clients, then you'd have to worry about, you know, getting a Salesforce credit or user ID for a person to view the dashboard or inside Salesforce as an example. Otherwise exchange of data happens in behind the scenes to API calls that's one conduit, the one second part which is strictly data is using the API calls. Like we mentioned, the restful API and doing a similar activity minus the embedded of Docebo, right? We do offer what's called the I pass offer which makes a little bit more easier in terms of extracting the data from our platform and moving it to, you know, downstream sub processors as an example. But that's again if it's something that you guys are comfortable using restful API and just do it that way instead, right? Plus it's easy on the cost to not that's probably Kyle's like saying, shut up, Danny. But anyway.\nKILEY\n11:58 \nNo, what I'm saying.\nDANNY\n12:02 \nBut yeah, you do restful API and you can exchange data that way as well. So.\nWILLIAM\n12:06 \nSo, Danny, the use case in my mind for sales is going to be when somebody passes a course, we're gonna want to update their record in Salesforce. So the sales team is aware that, you know, here's some activity. Somebody's actually doing something. It sounds like that would be something that we would want to handle diy using the API calls.\nCoach & Share\nDANNY\n12:28 \nYeah, I would strongly recommend doing the diy approach. It's just that's more of a customized functionality. Ours is a very strict standard version of just exchanging learning data to and from Salesforce.\nKILEY\n12:39 \nRight.\nWILLIAM\n12:39 \nOkay. Is there a knowledge base, help disk, but customer facing where people are asking questions like this and sharing ideas?\nIntegrations\nDANNY\n12:50 \nWe do have a communities. I'm not 1,000 percent sure aware of what the communication looks like from a Salesforce perspective, but there's anecdotal evidence that people do talk about in the community side of the fence. I don't know Kyle, if you have like a magic box of like here's, a bunch of community threads on Salesforce, but there could be, there could be some that's there.\nIntegrations ends\nDANNY\n13:10 \nWe just have to poke around maybe and compile it for you. Look and Chris has sent out a link to.\nCHRIS\n13:16 \nGeneral knowledge base.\nDANNY\n13:18 \nYeah, just.\nCHRIS\n13:19 \nOpen free. Have fun digging around in there. We do have a Docebo Community that is for our clients and we can definitely get you something on that as well. It's a really fun thing to dig through even on our side every now and then I get a question that I just don't know and my colleagues haven't quite run into it but a customer did and they fix it on their own and they kinda put that out there into the either.\nCoach & Share\nCHRIS\n13:42 \nSo we get a actually a lot of really fun ideas from our community as well. There's a lot of good info in there, but yeah, just a knowledge base is a great place to start but we get some more info to you.\nWILLIAM\n13:53 \nOkay, great. Yeah, it looks like there's a bunch of Salesforce stuff on the community. Cool.\nCoach & Share ends\nMICHAEL\n14:03 \nActually, I do have another question, not technical but like I'm curious if, you know, we do have like trainings that don't happen online, like in person trainings and stuff. We'll be able to use the system for, you know, basically keeping track of attendees that went to those or creating certificates for that.\nCourse Enrollment\nCHRIS\n14:25 \nFor the Instructor led training?\nMICHAEL\n14:28 \nYeah.\nCHRIS\n14:28 \nYes. So what we do is we integrate with your Zoom as well. I think that's what you guys are using but we can do teams, Google meets whatever. So what they'll do is we'll actually go through our platform to get into the meeting. We'll move over to Zoom or whatever the case may be. But we're going that route, so we can actually track your attendance fully and you can have full portability on your attendance and we can even associate it with other content in there as well. Yes. So a lot of fun things we can do.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nMICHAEL\n15:00 \nThat's cool. And then go ahead Bill.\nWILLIAM\n15:03 \nSorry, Mike, does that replace code that we currently have running or?\nMICHAEL\n15:07 \nYeah, that's what I'm trying to see if basically because we had built something home made for that and if this could replace, that would be great. But then speaking to that as well, if we have, you know, historical data, would we be able to import that?\nOnboarding\nCHRIS\n15:25 \nSo that's yeah, that's part of our process when we're talking to you guys to get our scope of work for bringing on for bringing you guys on with our onboarding process. So we do have a migration services. So what we'll do is we'll get you guys over a form about all the different data points we typically look at and have you fill it out.\nWrap-Up\nCHRIS\n15:42 \nWhat type of information are you looking to bring over how much of it is there? So we can really get that scope of work figured out?\nMICHAEL\n15:49 \nAwesome. Cool. It's all I have.\nKILEY\n15:55 \nGreat question, right?\nWILLIAM\n15:58 \nAnd I think I have my questions answered on the Salesforce side. So I'm good too.\nIntegrations\nKEVIN\n16:02 \nWhat with architecture? Are you guys based on your windows based SQL? Something else?\nDANNY\n16:11 \nYeah, no, we're spaced on the Aws platform. Yeah. In behind the scenes. If you want to get technical, it's on a Linux OS, yeah, using my SQL database to control the data of the platform and he is the application server.\nKEVIN\n16:26 \nOkay. So, so potentially if you ever wanted to set up an ETL process into our data warehouse, some of the, some of the data, yup.\nDANNY\n16:35 \nYup. We have a couple of proxies for that one is what's called reports, which is basically creating CSV flat files and transferring it through FTP. And the other one is the API and a third option that just came out in 2023 is now we have a data lake, right? So, what the data lake is a 24 hour refresh in a more canonical format, meaning a more schematic kind of star schema looking thing that you would either migrate or mirror, which is if you're a snowflake customer, then you can do what's a mirror, right? Or you can connect through the regular DS connection to be C drivers, right? To do your typical detail and the data in a table staging area, and do you extract, transform and load, right?\nKEVIN\n17:21 \nSounds good. All right. No red flags. John.\nJOHN\n17:26 \nGood. My head is blown right now. So I don't…\nIntegrations ends\nWILLIAM\n17:31 \nYeah, it terminology is so ridiculous.\nDANNY\n17:36 \nYeah, I know.\nKILEY\n17:37 \nThe little like names down on here. I'm like I'm gonna go look all this up later and figure all this out because I…\nKEVIN\n17:43 \nDon't bother it's all smoke screen?\nCHRIS\n17:46 \nThey make it up as it go. So they sound smarter, starting to understand it. This is all still new to me as well. So he can, Danny could lie to me all day and like, okay, yeah.\nDANNY\n17:58 \nThat's that's how I get Chris all on the Loop. You see fyi on the ETL with the SaaS?\nCHRIS\n18:07 \nYep, sure. Thank you. I think.\nKILEY\n18:10 \nSomeone mentioned diy earlier in my world. That means do it yourself. You know, I don't know if it's the same.\nDANNY\n18:15 \nI say.\nMICHAEL\n18:17 \nYou…\nKEVIN\n18:19 \nMark that one off. You don't have to look it up.\nKILEY\n18:23 \nOne out of 10.\nDANNY\n18:25 \nFunny enough when the mobile stuff came out like back in the old days because I've been a data architect for 25 years, you know, MDM stood for master data management. Now, mobile is coming out. It's called mobile data manager. So, when you say MDM, you have to ask in the context of what you?\nKEVIN\n18:43 \nAnd there's only three letter, so many three letter accents you could throw in.\nKILEY\n18:50 \nToday?\nKEVIN\n18:52 \nYeah. All right. Yeah. Well, thanks for this work. Do we appreciate it.\nWrap-Up\nKEVIN\n18:55 \nI don't think we have anything else on our side. So, thanks for sharing. And so we'll Loop back around next.\nJOHN\n19:02 \nWeek. All right. And then I will do the same with Kylie and I'll throw another acronym tgi F. Everybody.\nKILEY\n19:11 \nWe all know that one.\nJOHN\n19:12 \nYeah.\nKEVIN\n19:14 \nRight. Very nice.\nKILEY\n19:17 \nThank you guys so much for meeting you. Thank in touch bye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Michael and William discussed the possibility of Salesforce integration, with Danny explaining that they offer a manage package built on Salesforce apex commands.\n• Kevin asked questions about the architecture of Docebo.

How are you?\nDAVE\n0:03 \nI'm doing good, just ready to start the long weekend.\nCHRISTIAN\n0:09 \nMe too. Me too.\nDAVE\n0:13 \nYeah. Unfortunately, the guy didn't reach back out and fill out the info sheet, but I did fill up the quit with what knowledge I could find on the website.\nAbout Docebo\nCHRISTIAN\n0:23 \nAnything to let me know?\nDAVE\n0:26 \nUnfortunately, not. Yeah, like the demo request didn't have any info. Basically, it's a esop company. So their employee owned… they sell hvac materials like sheet metal materials and bunch of stuff for air conditioning units… and he is the wording and director. So it's definitely the right.\nCHRISTIAN\n1:00 \nAnd program manager, but, yeah.\nDAVE\n1:03 \nYeah, yeah. Okay.\nCHRISTIAN\n1:08 \nSo, yes, to say. So it was an outbound in any further demo requests from the outbound?\nDAVE\n1:16 \nYeah, he was an outbound account and he came inbound.\nSmall Talk\nDAVE\n1:38 \nA couple of minutes.\nCHRISTIAN\n1:39 \nYeah, no rush. Any plans this weekend?\nDAVE\n1:43 \nMan. Just trying to do a little yard work, you know, kinda take it easy. Probably gonna do something Saturday night, but gonna try and get up early tomorrow and knock some stuff out before the weather changes too much again.\nCHRISTIAN\n1:59 \nYeah.\nDAVE\n2:03 \nIt's been pretty inter, mess with decent weather.\nCHRISTIAN\n2:06 \nSo, where you located?\nDAVE\n2:08 \nI'm pretty near Athens. I'm in a town called gainesville.\nCHRISTIAN\n2:13 \nOkay. There is Kyle.\nDAVE\n2:16 \nAll…\nCHRISTIAN\n2:16 \nRight.\nCHRISTIAN\n2:21 \nHello?

So, so I brought Christian here today.\nSmall Talk ends\nDAVE\n2:30 \nHe's one of our account executives. He's going to be leading this meeting. I'm just here to take notes and, you know, answer any questions you might have. So I'll let him take it away.\nKYLE\n2:39 \nExcellent.\nCHRISTIAN\n2:40 \nThanks, Dave. Yeah. So, Kyle, I know that you reached out to us asking for a demo and typically, we just have a quick first call to understand your use case. So when we do provide a presentation that's really custom to your, what you got going on. So really the call today is to help with that plus determine if we're a fit between the two organizations. So like an okay plan.\nKYLE\n2:59 \nYeah, sounds good.\nCHRISTIAN\n3:00 \nWonderful. So probably the best place to start honestly because he reached out to us after us reaching out to you for a while. We'd love to know, you know, why you reached out to us, what you're looking at doing, if you got any plans for MS project?\nKYLE\n3:10 \nYeah. So that's where we're at. We're in the process of evaluating LMS systems. We are looking to be… fairly active in kind of our search and getting a system implemented. The goal would be to have something up and running by June or July. So looking to kind of make a decision on the provider that we're going to go with in probably the next few weeks… we're coming from a pretty old… I don't even know if it's considered an LMS, but it's called.\nIntegrations\nKYLE\n3:48 \nOkay. And it's a software that is, you know, it's hosted on our website, but reporting capabilities are terrible. Employee database doesn't sync with our HRIS… just really not very… just not very complex. So we're looking to upgrade to something that we can integrate with our HRIS system which is UK G pro… and looking for a little bit more flexibility and something that can give us, you know, better reporting capabilities, better analytics, things that will help kind of propel our learning efforts.\nIntegrations ends\nCHRISTIAN\n4:34 \nOkay. Understood. So a couple of questions just kind of set some foundation. So you are a manufacturing wholesaler of H back, correct? That's correct? Okay. Understood. And so for the use case, are we primarily just training internal employees and those on staff or are we doing corporate staff as well? Like what does the Audience look like?\nKYLE\n4:54 \nYeah, definitely. Corporate staff, definitely frontline workforce. Our current LMS system is filled with a lot of safety like forklift training, things of that nature. So safety compliance training… we have a new ERP system that we're going to be implementing in the next year and a half. And so it's going to be a lot of that, but we haven't made that choice yet on what software we're going to go with. But having a system that's capable to, you know, either take new files that we're getting from the ERP provider or something that's going to allow us to offer our own trainings for the ERP system that's going to be a big part of it. And then we also offer our own trainings when it comes to product knowledge around hack products.\nCHRISTIAN\n5:46 \nOkay. And when it comes to stuff like safety and forklift, are you getting that elsewhere or are you making that as well?\nKYLE\n5:51 \nWe're typically getting it from the supplier of the forklift. So, okay, the forklift manufacturers.\nCHRISTIAN\n5:58 \nOkay. And you just have the content locally then. Understood? Okay, great. What about stuff like sexual harassment and other compliance trainings?\nKYLE\n6:06 \nThose are things that I'm currently outsourcing but it's something that we are hoping to upgrade with obviously the software upgrade looking for something that has content packages as well. So, I'm just to kinda give you full transparency. I've talked with a few different LMS systems. I've talked with Cornerstone Adobe, a company called brainier, they are a partner that we learned about from U.\nIntegrations\nKYLE\n6:33 \nKG. So… from our HRIS system, they are like a preferred partner. And then I stumbled across the CEO on the at D website, the association of Talent development. So you guys are a preferred vendor… and yeah, that's kind of. But basically, I've seen that a lot of providers are offering content packages, right? And like right now, I have a license for LinkedIn learning. I have 10 licenses for that, and I don't feel like we utilize them enough. I don't feel like I can, I don't have like the, I don't have as good of capabilities to assign trainings… you know, evaluate reporting on how well the trainings are going, things of that nature.\nCHRISTIAN\n7:22 \nDo you, do you like the learning thing, learning content, all else being equal in terms of the actual way to provide the content?\nKYLE\n7:27 \nNot particularly.\nCHRISTIAN\n7:29 \nOkay.\nKYLE\n7:31 \nBut I don't know some of it's good. Some of it. I don't love it's you know, I think it's for a certain type of learner. You have to be very diligent and obviously, it's very self directed. I like to see more micro learnings where there's a little bit more engagement.\nCHRISTIAN\n7:49 \nFor sure. Understood. So, yeah, like for some context that we do have our own like 80,000 plus course library, although we have some smaller packages because they're obviously not gonna need all that we do natively integrate with LinkedIn learning as well if you did want to go that route, but it doesn't sound like it.\nIntegrations ends\nCHRISTIAN\n8:03 \nBut so much of that honestly is like how you provide the experience and the way we do it internally. Like as a learning organization is we'd like to keep all things in one place. So, whether that be compliance safety, like they're going to have to be in the LMS to look at that.\nIntegrations\nCHRISTIAN\n8:17 \nAnd there you can provide avenues to other types of content as well while you're providing that kind of training, right? So it's really in terms of the navigational experience that you provide a, an kind of supplementing stuff that they have to do with stuff that actually might benefit them. Well, also showing them how they would benefit, right? Like that LinkedIn learning content. Like do they, what do they get out of that? They will, they get the content to get skills? Do they care about potential future opportunities? Do they care about more money in that capacity as well, right? So like when it comes to increasing engagement, kinda got to beat them to the punch there. So like.\nIntegrations ends\nDAVE\n8:46 \nI guess that brings me to.\nCHRISTIAN\n8:47 \nThe other question Kyle, like with a new project like this for your organization? Like what are your end goals or what does success look like? Does it just mean like hiring engagement people are taking train more regularly or does it mean like more consistent compliance rates? Like what does success look like to you?\nKYLE\n9:01 \nYeah. Good question. We're behind the eight ball in the terms of learning and development and training. And my position, I'm a one man team for training, right? So like establishing that learning culture has been a challenge for us… and not having the tools to kind of further that is also making it challenging?\nCHRISTIAN\n9:24 \nThis is.\nKYLE\n9:24 \nA step in that direction and on our strategic plan… that we are just putting out for the next three years, I just want to find kind of the exact verbiage to give you an idea of what that looks like.\nCHRISTIAN\n9:40 \nThat'd be awesome.\nKYLE\n9:46 \nOn here somewhere.\nKYLE\n9:55 \nThe idea though as I'm struggling to find it now, the idea is that we want to create a learning environment where all of our employees are engaging with learning. They're committing to it… right now, we have a it computer security program called now before, I think that's pretty popular… and… it's created accountability for our employees because there is easy reporting, right?\nCustom Reports\nKYLE\n10:28 \nManagers get a report every month that says whether or not the employees have completed it… and, you know, some of it, you can see how long an employee was on that training for. So sometimes you see an employee who went through it in like two minutes, right?\nCustom Reports ends\nKYLE\n10:43 \nSo like how much did they really get out of that? But at the same time they are getting the information. And so there is some progress even if someone's not taking it, you know, super seriously. The idea right now is to try to get 100 percent learner engagement across the organization, which obviously is a, I mean, I recognize that's not realistic, but it's to assign content to learners and get closer to, you know, all employees taking different trainings that are relevant to their roles. I wouldn't say it's necessarily safety driven or anything like that. But having a system that provides content that would be relevant to, you know, business skills for our corporate employees, safety or… you know, maybe it's health and wellness for our warehouse employees, like expression flex or something of that nature… that's part of it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kyle revealed he is looking for better reporting capabilities as well as integration with their HRIS system U K G Pro; content packages are also desired due to their current license of 10 LinkedIn Learning licenses not being utilized enough or having good capability for assigning trainings or evaluating reporting on how successful those trainings have been.  \n• Finally, when asked what success looks like for this project—creating a learning culture- they are looking for 100% learner engagement across the organization by assigning relevant content to learners in areas such as safety compliance training; corporate staff trainings; product knowledge around HVAC products; sexual harassment training; ERP implementation (for which they don't yet have software); micro-learning opportunities with more engagement potential than LinkedIn Learning offers them now.\n• The goal is to have a new system implemented by June/July. \n• They have also looked into Cornerstone and Brainier.\n END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN\n11:44 \nHave have you surveyed them what they care about?\nKYLE\n11:47 \nWe have not.\nCHRISTIAN\n11:49 \nSo like first of all, like I love the goal and I love the direction you're going in like I think that's like fantastic. And also, it's a great way to go about it. But we got to understand what they care about too, right?\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN\n12:00 \nLike that, health and wellness is 100 percent amazing direction to go in. But employees care about different things at different times, right? So like the learning culture and like 100 percent engagement is actually, I know it doesn't seem entirely realistic and there's questions about what that means, whether like 100 percent engagement means like throughout the year or monthly, you know, we can discuss.\nIntegrations\nCHRISTIAN\n12:19 \nBut with that being said, typically, if you can provide that learning environment where the content also is engaging to them.\nDAVE\n12:27 \nNot personal, could.\nKYLE\n12:28 \nBe a.\nCHRISTIAN\n12:29 \nWhat kind of you want to set up but just professionally as well and what that means to them, right? Like you take this training, it gives you better business skills that's great.\nIntegrations ends\nCHRISTIAN\n12:38 \nNow, does that reflect on a leader board on the homepage that leadership has access to and has visibility over, right? Like maybe that adds a different layer of depth of meaning for that learning for that learner not to use the word too many times.\nKYLE\n12:49 \nSo, like…\nCHRISTIAN\n12:50 \nThere's there's a bunch of ways to think about it for sure. And I'd love to explore that for you, but I think that's like a great direction to go in, right? So all understood there now, when it comes to your training, do you do any Instructor led training as well?\nKYLE\n13:04 \nWe do quite a bit actually. So that would be something that I'm looking for as well. Having a system that provides, you know, better tracking right now. I don't even have like a full database of employees in my current elements. I can't even track all of the training that we're doing. So. Yeah, that, yes.\nCHRISTIAN\n13:26 \nDo all your frontline workers have emails?\nKYLE\n13:28 \nNo.\nCHRISTIAN\n13:29 \nUnderstood. And does so, the, does that meaning exist in UK, G, or do some of the frontline workers not in exist in UKG?\nKYLE\n13:37 \nEveryone exists in UK G because that's where we process our payroll. But, you know, if an employee's not work facing, then it is up to them to have an email address listed in the system. It's becoming more of a requirement because all new employees have to apply online and they have to put in their email. They have to, they have to use, you have, they have to utilize an email to go through the hiring process. But we have, you know, we have a large population in our manufacturing areas and warehouse or areas where we have, you know, employees who have been here for 15, 20 years and, you know, English isn't their first language and they don't they choose not to have an email because they don't like to be communicated that way. So that, that's a barrier for us for.\nMobile App\nCHRISTIAN\n14:31 \nUnderstood. Understood. It could still work. Okay? It may mean limitations for stuff like Notifications.\nKYLE\n14:37 \nYeah.\nCHRISTIAN\n14:38 \nYou'd actually communicate with them that way but getting them in the system is still cool. Now, there's always for frontline workers, there's always a question of accessibility as well, right? Like do you allow them to enter on their phones or do you have like a computer in each facility?\nMobile App ends\nKYLE\n14:52 \nWe, we have computers in each facility for them to kinda dedicate time for them to do training. But I do believe going forward, part of my plan is to find different ways for them to connect. We, we're also in the process right now actually implementing a new kind of internet.\nMobile App\nCHRISTIAN\n15:15 \nIt's…\nKYLE\n15:16 \nCalled it's called be keeper. And so it's mobile based, you know, with a traditional internet, you're only getting employees who are on the, you know, the website or sorry on the current IP address at work or have a VPN. So that kind of was a major barrier for those frontline employees. So we're providing a mobile app that they can access on their phones. It's similar to like a social media kind of… platform. And so I see something similar hopefully happening with like the training.\nCHRISTIAN\n15:54 \nYeah, actually like I'm assuming you pi, so from other systems, but she was a fully fledged like social platform built in, but you can have it dedicated to certain things.\nMobile App ends\nCHRISTIAN\n16:04 \nWe can dig into that then like there's a lot of strategies or ways you can approach that too. Okay. Understood on all of that. Now, back to the Instructor led training. Just one other care taking question. Are those virtual or primarily in person?\nKYLE\n16:17 \nThey can be both. I would say probably about 50 50 split. Okay. Yeah.\nCourse Enrollment\nCHRISTIAN\n16:26 \nThe virtual Webinar tool are you using for that?\nKYLE\n16:29 \nZoom teams just depends. We utilize both. I would say Zoom is probably a little bit more common, but have Microsoft, so, you know, outlook is frequently used. I know when we have implemented in the past managers like the ability to kind of integrate their outlook calendar with, you know, if there's a training and it's scheduled on the LMS. It would be nice for it to be able to connect with like an outlook calendar.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nCHRISTIAN\n16:58 \nWe actually have a native integration with outlook. Yes. And with that, there's some advantages too because I think like it's always like very finicky with how people talk about this stuff. So, is this your first time buying an LMS Kyle?\nKYLE\n17:13 \nYes, I am still relatively new.\nCHRISTIAN\n17:15 \nOkay.\nKYLE\n17:16 \nThe learning and development world and our company is again way behind. So, yes, all new on all of it?\nCHRISTIAN\n17:26 \nOkay. Understood. So I would say because as a previous buyer as well now, in sales, like as a word of like to really think about when it comes to integrations, like it's very easy for anybody to tell you, yes. But what they may not tell you is the work involved on your end or development work.\nCourse Enrollment\nCHRISTIAN\n17:41 \nIf that's all essential or like what does it actually mean to integrate? Like, is it just user provisioning for outlook? Does it mean just sending calendar, their invites or if a session were to switch times, would it actually change it in the calendar or would it duplicate it in the calendar, right?\nIntegrations\nCHRISTIAN\n17:54 \nThere's? Like a lot of little finicky stuff. So whether it's tables direction or another direction, I'd always recommend just making sure you validate those integrations with the correct people on your side, especially from U KG. We're happy to go through those steps and fully show everything when it comes to integration because we're very confident in each of these integrations, whether it be outlook UK, Zoom teams.\nCourse Enrollment\nCHRISTIAN\n18:13 \nWe have native integrations with those as well, but just something to mentioned, but to bring it back to outlook, yes. So we do have a native integration. So that includes anything that you would need a notification for calendar invites. And again, like I mentioned a moment ago, it'll actually change calendar invites if it's like for example, you change in ILT time to keep outlook calendars relatively clean and make sure like nonexistent invites are in there. It is a native integration though for sure.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nKYLE\n18:39 \nAwesome.\nCHRISTIAN\n18:40 \nOkay, great. So other than that, like I actually like I really enjoyed the call. I love the direction your organization is going in when it comes to learning and like taking that learning culture approach and the fact that your leaders back that up is excellent too because they'll see benefits from retention to many other areas as well just in terms of like improve performance. But now there's a whole methodology and ideology behind doing this, right? And so we'll try to like if you do go our direction, we'll be very consultative in terms of like best practice of customers and all that. But other than that, it sounds like a very solid fit between our two organizations unless I'm missing anything.\nLayout & Content\nCHRISTIAN\n19:13 \nAnd I'd love to show you a demo. I wanna focus very specific on the things we talked about today and keep a highly custom. But before we talk about that, do you have any questions or is there anything I missed that's important to your use case?\nKYLE\n19:24 \nNo, just off the bat, you know, it does seem like… you guys would be a good fit for our needs.\nLayout & Content ends\nKYLE\n19:32 \nI love the questions that you've already asked and, you know, being part of a team that implemented U KG. And now I'm kind of… the head person on our be keeper project and learning more about those implementations. And like you said, you know, the sales rep sell a lot.\nCHRISTIAN\n19:52 \nYeah.\nKYLE\n19:52 \nAnd, and you learn as you go and we tried to do our best to get that through be keeper having, you know, kind of had some of those pain points when we went through U KG and we got better. But I, now that we're in the implementation stage with be keeper, there's a few things that we're running into that seemed like they were a little over sold. You know, ideally you can work around those things, right? But like it's just not ideal and some of it may be outside of their control. Like we're learning that UK G will only allow certain fields to be sent out as part of an integration partnership. But I like that, you know, bring that up prior and, you know, obviously you're awareness of that challenge. I think that's great the questions that you asked at the beginning about content and kind of where our direction is as an organization. Those are things that, you know, I need help with. And I love the fact that, you know, you guys are a software provider, right? That you kinda have that mindset of we want to make the platform work for your customers. That's what's gonna obviously create retention for you guys as well. So, yeah, I like it. I have an LMS committee that I'm working with. So it's like six or seven of us I'm trying to schedule them into the demos as well. So I can just have one demo as opposed to doing like two or three allowing them to see the capabilities of the platform as well.\nPricing\nKYLE\n21:21 \nSo if that's the next step, I'd like to try to get a calendar or a date that would work for my committee also. And then just final thing kind of ballpark price for a, I guess we're probably about 656 150 user counts… cost of the software and then pack content packages. You put a ballpark like within like a 20,000 dollar range or something.\nPricing ends\nCHRISTIAN\n21:51 \n100 percent. So, yeah, I think I gave you exact pricing right now based on our conversation. So when it, and first off, I do appreciate you saying all that, like we do try to really focus on that kind of overall experience. Like we as like sales people like we are held accountable for happy or unhappy customers.\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN\n22:09 \nSo it's a big part for us to make sure that all is good there. Okay? So yeah, let's talk about customers. So I mean, sorry price. So when it comes to 606 150 users, again, should we based pricing off of assuming that all of those folks will be active or do we want to go maybe a Tad under that?\nKYLE\n22:28 \nNo. All active?\nCHRISTIAN\n22:30 \nOkay. Understood. So I'll give you a quick rundown about how the pricing works. And I'll give you a ballpark. So it's going to be a bit different vendor to vendor and it's not always apples to apples. So Docebo, we work off an active user model and we assume that, well, what we do is we provide you a bucket of how many up to monthly active users you get on a monthly basis. And our active user is defined by an individual who logs into the platform and accesses an actual course or piece of content. So kind like if you go in and check a report, you don't count as active. But if one of your learners start a course, then they become active, they then remain active for a full 30 day billing period after which they are no longer active and you could allow different unique users into the platform. So for that too active just means active. So whether they access one course or 100 courses, it doesn't matter. They just remain active till the 30 days are done. And then that's gone. Makes sense so far?\nKYLE\n23:26 \nI guess, can you kind of explain that a little bit more? So if an employee is not active for 30 days, then they would go inactive.\nCHRISTIAN\n23:33 \nNo, sorry. Okay. Let me reiterate. So. Okay. So an active user again is the individual who access content and they become active once they access content, when they are active, they remain active for 30 days or that overall 30 day billing period. So from like let's say you buy Docebo on like March second, they don't they become inactive the next month, 30 days after, when the billing period is done. And once they are no longer active, that means you can allow different active users into the next month… still a little fuzzy?\nKYLE\n24:06 \nYeah, I, well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kyle mentioned they do a lot of instructor-led training with virtual webinars using Zoom or Microsoft Outlook; however, some frontline workers don't have emails yet. \n• They are implementing Be Keeper mobile app to provide better access for these employees but would need help with integrations between this platform and other systems like UKG or Outlook Calendar for notifications/invites etc. \n• They have an LMS committee.  END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN\n24:09 \nLet me show you. Let me, I'll show you maybe an actual like visual would be a bit better.\nKYLE\n24:14 \nIt's so it's a monthly billing cycle is.\nCHRISTIAN\n24:17 \nNo, it could be annual or quarterly. So I'm just not doing a very good job.\nKYLE\n24:21 \nNo, you're good. I understand where you're coming from. I'm just trying to get… trying to get a good understanding because I went through something similar like this with be keeper with like the whole, you know, we were told the per user per month cost, right? And then the billing is annual and it's like if we have like some wiggle room of like user count numbers. So the whole active inactive thing after 30 days, I was a little confused.\nCHRISTIAN\n24:49 \nYeah, totally. So this is kind of like a quick look at what it looks like. Okay. So again to kind of like literally read it out verbatim. So in active users at Shape a user that logs into the platform and access as an asset. So like opens a video watches, of course, over a given a 30 day billing period. So, let's say you buy a bucket of 1,000 monthly active users. Okay? That means on a monthly basis, you get up to 1,000 monthly active users to leverage, right? And if you are 300 monthly active users or 600 monthly active users in that given month, the pricing is the same because you're in that 1,000 monthly active user by.\nKYLE\n25:28 \nGotcha. And is that the, that's the increments that you guys use is like 1,000?\nCHRISTIAN\n25:32 \nIt goes, it starts at 300 then 501,000, then it adds by 500 every single next bucket.\nKYLE\n25:38 \nSo being over 500, like if we were to say 500, we would be… I see where you're kinda going there and asking about, would everyone be on the platform?\nCHRISTIAN\n25:50 \nYeah.\nKYLE\n25:53 \nInteresting. Okay. I, I'm on the same page now.\nCHRISTIAN\n25:57 \nCool. So there could be like two different ways this can go, right? So, for example, if we go with the 500 monthly active user bucket, let's assume that you do have 100 percent engagement at 600 employees per month, right? So you would pay your typical 500 monthly active user bucket. And for every employee above that, 500 monthly active users, for only those employees, we charge what we call an overage fee. And that overage fee can range anywhere from like three dollars to six dollars. So in a month where you have 600 active users in the 500 active user bucket, you pay your normal bucket fee plus like three times 100, which is like another 300 dollars for that month. And once that month is over, they are no longer active and you can allow different users in or the same users, right? So, the whole point by an active user model is that you're only paying for usage and not your named users because you could have like 100,000 users in the platform. We don't care about that. We don't charge for that. We only charge for the buckets of active users. So if we were to predict like 500 monthly active users was a good range, then we would go with that.\nKYLE\n27:00 \nYeah. I like that because, you know, obviously we're… full headcount, we're 100 and like 20 over that right now, our headcount fluctuates pretty significantly based on kind of the season, heating and air conditioning, really ramps up obviously in like the summer, occasionally in the winter, but… you know, with 624 employees, you know, 100 percent, you know, engagement would be great but it's probably not realistic. So say, I am closer to 500 or 550. Then it seems like that would be the smarter route for us to go. But I guess it would depend upon the price difference between the 500 and a 1,000 user, right? Because I'm assuming a 1,000 for a 1,000 CC, get a bigger discount.\nPricing ends\nCHRISTIAN\n27:55 \nExactly. And like honestly it's a cost analysis, right? Like is there a worse than the price difference in your case? And like you've been through to technology buying processes by now, you, we'll get into negotiations and there will be discounts and all that kind of stuff. Like with any other vendor you're talking to, especially if you put us against each other, right?\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN\n28:13 \nIf you tell quarter, hey, Docebo is like, you know, they're offering a really good deal. The Cornerstone is gonna come down 100 percent. So, like realistically, by the end of this conversation, what I honestly see happening is me providing the 1,000 monthly active users for close to the 500 monthly active user cost that will cover overage that will see you well into the future as well. But we'll see when we get there, right? We still got to see if the platform is like what you need. In the meantime. Let me give you some pricing for the 501,000 monthly active user ranges. And then we can go from there. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So let me just pull up my pricing sheets. So let's start off with 500 monthly active users. So for the core platform at 500 monthly active users, just the LMS itself, that is 28,890 dollars per year.\nKYLE\n29:06 \n28.\nCHRISTIAN\n29:07 \nYeah, 28 90 per year. Okay. And by the way, we can build quarterly or annually or semi annual, okay. For the social learning aspect which I'll showcase on the demonstration. So you can get a really good idea of what's actually included. That cost is 10,914 per year… and that's your software fees on an annual basis.\nIntegrations\nCHRISTIAN\n29:30 \nNow, let's talk about content. We have three different content packages. The first one is 50 courses and you could choose any 50 courses of the 80,000 and you get to switch those out once a year. The second is 150 courses that you get to select from. And then the third packages all 80,000, you get unlimited access to all the courses and picture like our course library like spotify, like any kind of course or artist or content provider you want. You just pull whatever you want. There's no additional cost or whatever it's just you get access to everything for a single cost.\nPricing\nKYLE\n30:04 \nOkay.\nCHRISTIAN\n30:05 \nSo at 500 monthly active users, the cost for content annually is 26,000.\nKYLE\n30:14 \nThat was for the 50 courses.\nCHRISTIAN\n30:15 \n50. At 150, it's 41,000… and premium, which is the whole library. All 80,000. It's 56 K.\nKYLE\n30:28 \nSo, this is something that, you know, has been, this is kinda new for me, right?\nIntegrations\nKYLE\n30:36 \nIn a situation where we're buying the platform separately or not separately but being built separately, right? For platform and content, which is similar to Cornerstone, similar to Adobe. I'm still trying to wrap my head around that whole, you know, what is necessary for us with like with a business like ours with ours, sorry, and a head count like we have, would you think that 50 courses would be enough to sustain like a year of learning for the different kinds of areas of employees we have?\nCHRISTIAN\n31:15 \nI would say, I would say it depends on what direction you take, right? Because you could for example, replace no before with our content because we have no before in our content library, correct? Right? So that could potentially not to eliminate them as your vendor. But if you want to bring some of that over, Docebo can Absorb that cost. Let's say because we can just deliver that content in our own library biting secret and other like business skills, right? I would say that if you're looking to be a bit on the safe side, the 50 courses is always too low, it always gets upgraded right away. Just what I see with my customers because that can just disappear so quickly.\nKYLE\n31:54 \nYeah.\nCHRISTIAN\n31:55 \nIf you're looking to satisfy your compliance thing like as well providing some business training, the 150 is, can be suitable for sure. If you're looking for the best value out, right? You can go with the content premium. But I'll kinda tell you my recommendation honestly. I would say start low, Kyle, like there's nothing hindering you from upgrading our contract technologically or financially in any capacity, right?\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN\n32:20 \nIf you want to start at the minimum package and just add it on as you go, you can do that, right? So if I had a recommendation start at 50 packages, sorry, 50 50 courses. And then if you fill that up, immediately, that's totally cool. Just give us a call. It'll be five minutes and say, you know what? I underestimated the score. 150, it takes us one second to update it and then you would prorate the cost. So it doesn't cost you. There's no penalties or anything. We would just add it onto the contract and that's it.\nPricing ends\nKYLE\n32:45 \nOkay. Yeah.\nCHRISTIAN\n32:46 \nTo…\nKYLE\n32:48 \nAnd that's been the big thing that I'm recognizing is, you know, you have the software cost, but the big cost comes in with content.\nCHRISTIAN\n32:55 \nYeah.\nKYLE\n32:56 \nAnd… my CFO is not a big fan of that part, but I also don't think that our executive team is fully understanding the amount that we spend on content right now… and so that's going to be like a factor rate like it's definitely something that I'm just trying to wrap my head around, but I appreciate you breaking it down… and for being transparent, you know, that the 50 is generally too low, but yeah, it's good information and good starting point. I appreciate it.\nCHRISTIAN\n33:31 \nNo worries. And honestly like if you ever need, if your CFO ever needs like a down to earth chat, like I can even call, my CFO is really good about talking to customers and they can just have a CFO chat on.\nKYLE\n33:41 \nYeah.\nCHRISTIAN\n33:42 \nGive him some perspective in that capacity.\nKYLE\n33:44 \nCFO chat. I'd be a good one.\nCHRISTIAN\n33:47 \nCFO checkout. I doubt a CFO will wanna talk to me, but a CFO may wanna talk to the CFO.\nKYLE\n33:53 \nI so doesn't want to talk to anyone. He just wants me to get this done at the cheapest possible cost right now.\nPricing\nKYLE\n33:58 \nI mean, he would probably be open to something like that. I think we're just, we're getting our head around these new SaaS costs, right? Every subscription, everything being annual, and we're going from with our ERP system, with our LMS system, we're going from softwares where we pay a one time yearly fee that's really low or not even a yearly fee. We're paying like a maintenance fee like an upgrade fee, but we bought the software out, right? So that's like a thing in the past, right? Like that doesn't happen anymore and there's a reason why, and obviously, with the upgrades that are happening technologically, we can't just continue to use what we have. So it makes sense that it's more expensive. And I'm just, I'm trying to get a better budgetary number to provide for them because the initial thought was like 50 K on an annual basis. And I, you know, I think what I'm learning is with content, everyone is higher than that… you know, I'm looking at your numbers here and it looks like there would be a possibility to be somewhere in that ballpark, but then are we getting everything we need?\nCHRISTIAN\n35:13 \nExactly exactly like, you know, I'd be a good way to go about it. And like just based on like experiences I've gone through like if I can, if you, I would have to be a kind of a two part process, right?\nOnboarding\nCHRISTIAN\n35:23 \nSo let's say you go Christian, you know, what? Like if you can bring this down to a certain level, then maybe we can do business together, right? And then we would go through a typical discount approval process on our end where I would say, hey, I spoke with Kyle. They agreed to move forward with Docebo. They agreed to move forward by this time. We need to give them this kind of price, right? It's a really easy way for me to negotiate internally to get preferred pricing for your team just because it's kind of like guarantees, right?\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN\n35:47 \nAnd we like to work and guarantees because forecasting that basing companies more important than anything. And then your end as well, like I don't know if I can get it down to 50. I can always try and let's say they say we can't do it but we can go like 53 54. It's not that much more to ask perhaps to kinda get what you need. So we can work on it. Let's do the demo first, but we can 100 percent like work on pricing if we get to that point.\nKYLE\n36:08 \nYeah, no. And… I love that. You know, you just have the obviously the transparency upfront, right?\nPricing ends\nKYLE\n36:16 \nYou guys know how this is gonna go there's. Going to be the negotiation between different vendors. Same thing is the same thing that we went through with our previous vendors and, you know, on the same point on token, you know, we, I recognize specifically, I'm not sitting here trying to drag people along to get something that's unreasonable. So it really is seeing the platforms and the LMS committee. The purpose of their involvement is to see, you know, what's gonna be effective for your employees and they're we have branch managers that are joining sales managers, manufacturing managers that are going to be joining. And so that's gonna be a big factor too. Is what are they like from a user interface? And, you know, those are going to be some factors too. But then, yeah, I appreciate you just obviously being upfront and transparent about the fact that there is some negotiate some negotiation there. And then, you know, obviously we'll be realistic on our side too.\nNext Steps\nCHRISTIAN\n37:17 \nCool. Sounds like a plan man. I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to our initial demonstration.\nKYLE\n37:22 \nMe too.\nCHRISTIAN\n37:23 \nFor scheduling that, would you prefer to do it over email because you got some moving parts or you got everybody's calendar right now?\nKYLE\n37:28 \nI could pull up calendars. Now. Let's see.\nKYLE\n37:52 \nAll right. I got them.\nCHRISTIAN\n37:55 \nWednesday is looking good. Friday is looking good for me next week?\nKYLE\n38:13 \nWednesday, my HR director who's my direct supervisor. She is out all day. Let's shoot for Friday. Let's shoot for Friday… right around the same time, maybe a little earlier sometime between 10 and noon mount.\nCHRISTIAN\n38:37 \nYour Mountain Time, we could always do Thursday afternoon too, but I can do that 100 percent.\nKYLE\n38:43 \nThursday afternoon is a possibility. What do you have? Thursday afternoon?\nCHRISTIAN\n38:50 \nI'm eastern. So your time, I'm free 12 to four.\nKYLE\n38:59 \nLet's… shoot two to three 30.\nCHRISTIAN\n39:06 \nSo that's four to five of my time is done. Cool. All right. Awesome. So, I'm gonna send you an invite if you wouldn't mind just forwarding that off to your colleagues and then we will get this going and I'll have something prepared for you by then.\nWrap-Up\nKYLE\n39:19 \nSounds good. We'll do. Thanks.\nCHRISTIAN\n39:21 \nHey, man. It was great meeting you. Thank you so much for the chat today. I'm looking forward to next week. And if you have any needs in the meantime, let me know.\nKYLE\n39:26 \nYeah, absolutely. Thanks guys. It was great meeting you both. Dave. Love the cat. My cat loves to be involved on virtual meetings.\nDAVE\n39:33 \nI'm telling you is every time?\nKYLE\n39:35 \nHe's a pain. Yeah, my cat jumps up like he's in front of the camera and I'm like great. All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nCHRISTIAN\n39:44 \nHave a good one.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The core platform at 500 monthly active users, just the LMS itself, that is 28,890 dollars per year.\n• Christian recommended starting with the 50 course content package and upgrading if needed; this comes with a yearly fee of 26,000 dollars.\n• The 150 course package costs 41,000 annually while 80,000 courses cost 56K per year.\n• Christian offered to negotiate discounts through an approval process on their end as well as potentially prorating any additional fees should more than 50 courses be required in the future.\n• Kyle discussed the process of negotiation between vendors and noted that they would be realistic with their expectations.\n• He and Christian agreed to have an initial demonstration on Thursday, at 2:00 PM Mountain Time.

{"prompt":"TRAVIS\n0:00 \nHey, Jacquelene. Hello. How's it going?\nJACQUELENE\n0:04 \nIt's going well. Good morning. Good afternoon, almost.\nTRAVIS\n0:08 \nNo, yeah. It is. It's about two o'clock here in Toronto. So, it's getting the end of the day, but people keep putting meetings on my calendar. So, I don't know, I don't think I'm shutting this laptop up till about six 37 o'clock but I, you know, I just tell myself all the time I signed up for this. No, no one forwards me into this job, right?\nSmall Talk\nJACQUELENE\n0:24 \nExactly.\nTRAVIS\n0:26 \nHow's things been going on contract plan?\nJACQUELENE\n0:29 \nHectic, similar to you find, you know, you have a plan for your day, and there are new meetings on your calendar and… you just have to like a plug away.\nTRAVIS\n0:44 \nNo, I gotta tell you. I've been talking to my manager about this whole and now working on Fridays things and I'm like, you know, these lots of folks, they seem pretty relaxed and I have a hunch it has to do with like not having to, well, yeah, he was the fan of idea.\nSmall Talk ends\nJACQUELENE\n0:59 \nOf course, I don't have that schedule. So I do work on Fridays and I can say that since I've been here, those who do have that schedule, they've still had to work on a Friday, so.\nTRAVIS\n1:11 \nOkay. Maybe Maria just seen us because, yeah, I try to schedule or like Travis, we just don't work on Friday or something like that. Sounds amazing. And yeah, my VP didn't agree, but it's nice to hear that. I'm not the only one working on Friday and very nice to meet you.\nJACQUELENE\n1:25 \nYes, Andrew, are you here in place of Maria today?\nANDREW\n1:31 \nWe were also expecting Maria, but it's good to see you both.\nBranches & Groups\nTRAVIS\n1:36 \nLikewise as well.\nJACQUELENE\n1:38 \nI'm sure. I…\nTRAVIS\n1:41 \nSo, I guess. And Andrew, you are you in Maria's group or you are part of Jacqueline group. So, I know last is quite large, but I kinda figured out who's part of who's group here.\nANDREW\n1:50 \nI am a part of Maria's group, yeah.\nBranches & Groups ends\nTRAVIS\n1:53 \nOkay. Right. Right. Okay. So talking to changes and she said things are looking very positive from a contract which is great. Jacqueline, thank you so much for just powering through that. I know it was a lot, hey, Maria. And so what I'm trying to figure out today is obviously what she's kinda shared with me is like, hey, they're kinda stuck on the, they can only do a one year agreement is kind of their policy. And she explained the policy and it made perfect sense. And so the reason we're kinda together today, I'm kinda trying to figure, is there any way we can get around that pause? Is there any higher Power we can kinda speak to? Because I've already talked to my contract folks.\nPricing\nTRAVIS\n2:36 \nI said, hey, is there any way we could honor that price which was cause, you know, we had the multi year discount and then an additional 20 percent discount on top of that. So, I mean, we're talking about a difference of almost 40,000 dollars. And I said, how do we, how do we do that for a single year? And they said Travis, like we can't sell the software for that price for a single year commitment. And I said, okay, let me go back to last and see if there's anything we can do someone we can speak to within last. So that can maybe help us get around this policy.\nPricing ends\nTRAVIS\n3:03 \nBecause Maria, I, I'd hate to, I mean, I felt like it took weeks to get the pricing approved last time to kinda get the budget approval. And I'm not getting it took a while. It took weeks because, you know, things just don't you know, there's process in place, but is there any way any person that can help us kinda get beyond this policy? Or are we stuck?\nPricing\nJACQUELENE\n3:24 \nSo I wanna ask a couple of questions and Mary, I don't know if you can answer it on this call or if it's something that we can go back one, how, what was the total amount that we received commission approval for?\nMARIA\n3:38 \nIt was the amount on the proposal. Was that Travis 79,000? I can look it up?\nTRAVIS\n3:43 \nGot it. I've got it because I was just kinda so here is.\nMARIA\n3:45 \nYeah, 67.\nTRAVIS\n3:48 \nYeah. So 67 for the license and then another 12 and then we have the services discounted another 25 percent. So, right around 12. So I think it's run around 79,000.\nJACQUELENE\n3:56 \nOkay. So that's the price for the first year, right? With yearly fee?\nTRAVIS\n4:01 \nOnly 67,000 per year after that, because the onboarding services just a one time kinda help you get it up and running and then 67 moving.\nJACQUELENE\n4:10 \nWell, I just asked because if, like if we went to the committee to the committee with the total three year amount and that's what was approved, then we wouldn't be having this conversation.\nPricing ends\nJACQUELENE\n4:21 \nSo to answer your first question, Travis, I don't think that there is a way that we can get beyond this policy because everything goes through a commission for approval. What I can say is that it is, hey, I have yet to, and I've only been here for a short time but I have yet to bring something to the committee and the commission and they've denied it. So a lot of it is by while we have to get, you know, it's a consent like they have to agree. I've not seen them deny anything so long as the budget is there, but it's just part of our process. So it's something that we have to do every year.\nPricing\nJACQUELENE\n5:03 \nAnd my understanding is that we've had contracts like this. The problem is we can't per SE enter into a multi year contract that says that we are going to obligate loss for these dollars for multi years because we don't have approval for that, we have approval for a year. And then the next year we would do an amendment or in this case, I'll probably just be like the order form for the new amount. We would take that to the commission would approve it. And then we move on. So that's why in the language and the contract we can have, you know, the, you know, begin year and then the three year.\nPricing ends\nJACQUELENE\n5:43 \nBut as far as the dollar amount it has to say pending approval from the commission because that is part of the requirement where we have to take it back to the commission and gain their approval. I know that we've done this before. We have several contracts that we do this with, right? Maria, I think the company we're using now, it's just been a matter of as a matter, of course, it's a part of the business but wasn't that was a multi year contract. The folks that we're currently with. If I'm not mistaken, please let me know, but we have other contracts where we have them for multi years. But as far as the fee is concerned, that's just part of the process to go back and say, can we approve the budget for this?\nTRAVIS\n6:39 \nSo, it sounds like so Jacquelene, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like they… I mean, they're it sounds like they might be that maybe I missed it. So they might be open to it or they'd be willing to at least hear our like kinda.\nPricing\nJACQUELENE\n6:51 \nYeah.\nTRAVIS\n6:52 \nYeah.\nJACQUELENE\n6:53 \nYeah. It's a matter. Of course, it's not like I said, while I've been here for a short time, it's a spreadsheet that we provide here's. All of the new contracts we're doing here's. The dollar amount, approve it. They approve it during the committee meeting. It's not, and it's really, I can give you a little piece of it because I'm doing it next tomorrow for the month and it's really just we're requesting the commissions authority to enter into specific agreements and amendments. So this would be an amendment. We would bring the dollar amount, and then they'll say during the meeting that they approved. But as I said, as a matter of the process, but it's not like if they're gonna sit there and actually deny.\nTRAVIS\n7:39 \nRight. But so, so down here though, so in this, what this annual billing section here just to make for it to be proper, so the years two and three, this will be removed from the order form.\nPricing ends\nJACQUELENE\n7:55 \nMaria, how would that work on that? I know.\nMARIA\n7:59 \nSo… I guess I'm hearing a couple of things but for me, we need to see this because this is what we do intend on plan on pain. I hear Travis that from a business standpoint, because you're in the business to make money and there was a discount provided to lasso for multi year, our business side has an issue with not having this bound in stone. So to speak in the contract from loss side, we certainly are not like Andrew's here, and his team is gonna do a huge lift to move to Docebo. Certainly are not gonna move after a year. And also just for context, this learning management system is huge for providers.\nAbout Docebo\nMARIA\n8:56 \nI mean, this is like for, in terms of like what we're responsible able for to provide two providers. This is like a big, a huge piece and a high priority for providing funding for. So, you know, it's no, I could see hardly ever unless like the world was ending that we wouldn't get approved for this going forward.\nAbout Docebo ends\nMARIA\n9:21 \nBut to Jacqueline point, the way that lasa does everything is that we do have to go and kinda get this approval from our commission every year. I just feel like there's gotta be a way to satisfy both sides in a certain way that we word it.\nTRAVIS\n9:43 \nAnd that's the tricky part because with the way our contracts work is, you know, essentially if there is an out actually, let me explain why we give such big discounts for the multiple years.\nPricing\nJACQUELENE\n9:54 \nDo Travis, let me just interject because this is so here's, the thing… if we took the three year amount which we didn't do. And the reason we didn't do that is because another reason that probably falls into this, we have a threshold, right? The threshold here because this is a vendor contract. Maria, it just dawned on me is that it's under 100 K. So under 100 K, we do that under what we call executive director approval. So the commission don't need, they don't need to approve. And like I said, even their approval is matter is a rope thing. It's not, they don't go line by line. There's no explanation why is this on there? But even still, so that's how this contract would go through. It would be through the executive director. But if it's over 100 K, then we need to get approval. And that's why the first question I asked was how much did we gain approval for?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed pricing and how it would be approved by a commission if it goes over $100K. \n• If the deal is under 100K then executive director approval is required.\n• It was mentioned that they have multiple contracts with multi-year commitments, however this one has to go through approval from the commission every year due to policy requirements. END"}
{"prompt":"JACQUELENE\n11:05 \nAnd I think we need to go back Maria and see what that answer is. Because if it was 79, okay, there was no reason for it to go to commission. I.\nMARIA\n11:17 \nI didn't know it went to commission cause I've had other contracts like with est like that.\nPricing\nMARIA\n11:23 \nI had to, but I guess Jacqueline, are you saying if I'm not, if I'm hearing you correctly, we could put all three years together at, with the full price and then go to commission and be like here's the lump Sum for this LMS for the next three years?\nJACQUELENE\n11:43 \nWell, it wouldn't even be for the next three years. We would just be saying this is the total amount for this contract and whether it's broken years, that would be in material that might be an option, right? And we can visit that and see if that will work. But… if we keep it as it is, then we would need to do an amendment to the other three two, for the other two years. But again, it still wouldn't need approval because it's under 100 K. It.\nMARIA\n12:17 \nYou know, Jacqueline, maybe it did go to commission because I think that and bring padded the cost.\nPricing ends\nJACQUELENE\n12:26 \nWho do you said Brian?\nMARIA\n12:28 \nYeah. So, so when she presented in the budget meeting, maybe she asked for more.\nJACQUELENE\n12:35 \nOkay. I will have to take a look at this and see what exactly went how for, how much there may be a way that we can work this in the contract?\nJACQUELENE\n12:53 \nBecause I'm trying to see how we can work around like you said to come up with ideas to work around the system. But at the same time, Travis, I just, I wanted you to know and to feel comfortable. And again, like we said, we can keep the three year term in the contract. It doesn't need to be a one year, but I just think we need to work on the language a little bit we need to because we need to be accurate, right? Right? In the language.\nTRAVIS\n13:17 \nAnd, and I appreciate that, Jacquelene. And, yeah, from our perspective, and the reason why this is such a big deal to Docebo is it it's all surrounds our business model.\nPricing\nTRAVIS\n13:26 \nWhat we do is we give huge discounts for multiple years agreement. So we can go to the banks and say, hey, we can't tell you who we're working with, but we're going to get paid, you know, a year from now, this much money and a year after that, this much money, can we borrow that money today? And then we take that money and we pump it right into the product? And that way it really kind of incentivize our customers after the end of the three year term. This is wow. This product just keeps getting better and better. It makes it a no brainer to renew with that with any kind of language in the contract that says, hey, if they, if something happens, the contract is going to be null and void. At some point, we call it termination for convenience. But there's lots of ways to kinda word it the best, allow us to borrow against that contract. They said, well, this could just, this will just be they just won't allow us to borrow against it, which is why we've got kind of like our standard pricing. So any language that would allow us to go confidently and borrow against years two and three, would, you know, obviously make, you know, shangs and the rest of my legal folks very happy because that's part of the reason why we're able to get the thing is like I said about 40,000 dollars off the kind of the standard price.\nPricing ends\nJACQUELENE\n14:33 \nOkay. So I'll do some research on my end and see what, what's possible, but, you know?\nTRAVIS\n14:42 \nMy fingers crossed, you can work magic, Jack, and I know.\nJACQUELENE\n14:46 \nThank you for that vote of confidence, but we'll see what we can do on our end. Yeah, I just need to see, I think what we initially approved, and then how we approve it and how we approve going forward and then make them like some suggested language in the contract?\nTRAVIS\n15:08 \nLove it. Okay. Well, I appreciate that. Appreciate you trying to again, trying to find a way there because I know it's not easy when you're working with, you know, inside something like your organization where there's so many policies.\nJACQUELENE\n15:21 \nAnd Maria, any historical context or information you can provide to me to help with this will be greatly appreciated because, you know, I think we're a lot of us are new here. So we're trying to like dig in the archives to figure out what's been done.\nPricing\nMARIA\n15:36 \nSo, I can tell you, Jacquelene, with the current provider, I'm not sure we now do it by quarter.\nJACQUELENE\n15:44 \nYeah.\nMARIA\n15:45 \nI wasn't part of the contract previously, but I think Tyler Douglas would probably be the best.\nJACQUELENE\n15:50 \nYeah. Speak with Tyler and see what we've done in the past.\nMARIA\n15:55 \nBecause I feel like the understanding, the safeguards with lasso, but at the same time, we can't miss the forest for the trees like with tax payer dollars, pay 40,000 dollars more.\nJACQUELENE\n16:08 \nYeah.\nMARIA\n16:09 \nA yearly cost that doesn't make.\nJACQUELENE\n16:12 \nAnd that's what it really comes down to is that we are accountable for every Penny. So we need to make sure that we are as transparent as possible and that everything is above board. So, you know, while, and also, we don't want to mislead, as I said, based on my understanding, we have not had a contract be denied or not approved because of even the dollar amount, is really just more about letting the public know this is what we're spending the money and it's because it's a yearly thing. As I said, I think they could have done it all under one, but I don't think they did. So that's why we're here looking at just the one year dollar amount. But if looking at that invoice, if that was the information we had, I don't see why they wouldn't have like done a total number, but we just want to go back and confirm… but yeah, we just need to be as transparent as possible and give them all of the information of where tax dollars are going… perfect.\nWrap-Up\nTRAVIS\n17:21 \nOkay. Well, is Jacquelene okay? If I check in with you maybe a week from today, just kinda see how things are going.\nJACQUELENE\n17:29 \nAbsolutely, absolutely. And if I have an answer earlier, you'll hear from me?\nTRAVIS\n17:34 \nWonderful. And I'm gonna, I've been leaning on Chang. We should have something in back in your hands. I know we're so close to having the red lines done, but early next week, we should be having something back in your hands there.\nJACQUELENE\n17:46 \nFantastic.

Yeah, just to bring everyone along.\nROSALIND\n0:46 \nOr…\nALIA\n0:47 \nFor joining and a very short notice, we've been working together, Ryan and John and I in the past couple of months alongside Caitlyn who's our customer solutions consultant around drafting the best possible path and identifying… the requirements then the LMS needs that Ryan needs in order to decide which way to move forward… throughout our discussions.\nOnboarding\nALIA\n1:17 \nWe've identified the need for an autonomy in terms of LMS admin access for. So, yeah, I wanna kinda to just kinda open up the discussion… around, you know, some of the discussions that you've been having together.\nOnboarding ends\nRYAN\n1:39 \nYeah. Yeah. We really just need to only answer, you know, one one main question. And I can't remember, I look back through my notes. I honestly can't remember but from earlier discussions back in June internally and then our discussions in October, we decided that we, the best path forward probably was that we would need our own instance and I can't recall why I can, I honestly don't remember why.\nPayment Gateway\nRYAN\n2:12 \nSo the context just as a high level context is Rosalind manages interlocks learn the external training platform. They have one branch that is our one one child domain or extended enterprise is being used for CFS and Rosalind, you said they may use two additional ones. Is that correct? Okay. So that would be.\nPayment Gateway ends\nROSALIND\n2:39 \nGot a.\nRYAN\n2:40 \nOkay. Thank you. So that would be four four used, I guess four total. So, but all of their training is external customer training and we're looking for a solution that provides mainly internal training to our employees across all the companies, but also, we would at least need one extend enterprise for machinery or one branch for machinery so that they could, that's a division so that they could, you know, do customer training as well.\nPayment Gateway\nRYAN\n3:14 \nSo anyways, we talked with Rosalind and carry Solomon yesterday. And again, we just couldn't really remember why did we, why do we go the standalone instance route rather than extended enterprise? Because it sounds like from our discussion yesterday with the interlocks learn team, it may work as, you know, having us as a branch or an extended enterprise, the internal training… under the interlocks, learn branch and then also machinery. Obviously, we would need, I guess one extra branch for that, but, or the next step up in the enterprise package. But anyways, do you recall Alia, why, like, was there a specific?\nALIA\n4:01 \nYeah. Yeah. And sorry, I didn't get the chance to introduce my coworker.\nOnboarding\nALIA\n4:09 \nMariah is my peer here at table. She's also a major account manager. I didn't get the chance to bring along Kaitlyn because I know she is our technical resource. So Mariah will be able to walk us through visually why… we had that discussion, but I can speak to it on a high level.\nPayment Gateway\nALIA\n4:29 \nI remember Rosalind, you and I had met with Karen as I think… early on through the stages and where the thought process came through is we know the pros of using extended enterprise is to be able to extend from your existing instance. I think during, I believe I was in November or October the discussion. What I wanted to know is how much the LMS administrators, whether from interlocks or la trim or, you know, future LMS administrators would be working together. And part of why I wanted to understand that is you can definitely branch off of… Intralox is extended enterprise. But what we wanted to know is does interlocks care that la trim can log in and sorry… I'm just gonna drink some water. Does a trim if later logs in and has access to your route admin menu because that is not separated in the platform. So.\nROSALIND\n5:48 \nYou, you're saying that if they were to use extended enterprise, they would not be able to use SSO?\nALIA\n5:56 \nThey can't they can't their own SSO, but the administrative menu, what a company is joining? What?\nPayment Gateway ends\nROSALIND\n6:05 \nYeah.\nALIA\n6:06 \nLike it's shared?\nROSALIND\n6:08 \nOkay.\nALIA\n6:09 \nSo typically, for clients who expand from internal to customer to partners, they have one LMS admin team that works together that kinda know, have they built the central repository, the courses, the learning plans, and they've kind of identified who owns what. And this is where the conversation started at the time.\nPayment Gateway\nRYAN\n6:36 \nSo, so… that makes me… that makes me more comfortable in the decision or the route we were going. I think if I understand correctly. So, if so, Rosalind is the product owner for interlocks, learn and I'm the product owner for like the internal instance or let's just consider it being a child domain or extend an enterprise. If I log in to that instant or that enterprise, the internal training, you know, branch there's a shared admin… menu. Is that what you're saying Alia?\nALIA\n7:19 \nAnd Rosalind, if you would give us permission, do you mind if we can showcase interloxes? Current?\nROSALIND\n7:32 \nYeah.\nALIA\n7:33 \nVisualization, do you mind from here and kinda walking us through?\nMARIAH\n7:40 \nYeah. Hi, everyone. Nice to meet you. I'm one of the senior account managers here. So I've been around for a while. I have a lot of customers leveraging extended enterprise and I have a lot of customers that have decided to branch out on their own interests or on their own instance. Excuse me. So Alia wanted me to join and just offer my support and what I've seen work well in the past and she's right? So, so the short answer is yes, could you set up your own branding, your own domain, your own SSO with extended enterprise? Absolutely, that is exactly what it's for, but I like to tell my customers that there's pros and cons to each solution.\nUser Permission\nMARIAH\n8:20 \nSo when it comes to really having autonomy of your own brand with within extended enterprise, you would really need to be a super admin because super admins are the only ones that have access to the central repository which is where your content lives. Super admins are the ones that can create pages and menus, which are the dashboards that your learners would go to access their training.\nPayment Gateway\nMARIAH\n8:46 \nSo as a super admin, you really have access to everything. And so when I say that means that you, Ryan could log in and, you know, you could potentially change something that would impact interlocks, all of your users, all of your courses, all of your content lives within the interlocks route domain.\nBranches & Groups\nMARIAH\n9:11 \nSo for example, when we're talking about users, you would have a branch here that would say later, but you would be able to see all the other Branches and users as well. When you're creating courses, you all would need to kind of really get together and identify a naming convention or a course code type of process.\nBranches & Groups ends\nMARIAH\n9:33 \nBecause as you can see here, all of your courses live together as one, you can search. I know that right now, I think you have CFS institute along interlocks. So you can see CFS courses here, and so on and so forth. So it's almost a shared environment from an admin perspective. Grant your learners won't know the difference. They won't see interlocks, they'll only see later, they'll have their own SSO. But what I really want you all to think about is from an admin perspective, as long as everyone's aligned and there are governing principles in place, this could work really well for you.\nPayment Gateway\nMARIAH\n10:13 \nBut if you really want your own autonomy for your brand specifically and maybe manufacturing alongside of it because it would be similar. Then I think in those instances, it does make sense to branch out. So it really is just pros and cons. To each, but you could absolutely accomplish what you're looking for just by using one of the domains that you have existing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Alia and Mariah discussed the need for autonomy in terms of LMS admin access. \n• Ryan asked why they decided to go with a standalone instance rather than extended enterprise, as this would provide more control over branding and user permissions. \n• Mariah explained that while an extended enterprise can offer separate SSO, the administrative menu is shared between all branches within it. \n• She also noted that when using an extended enterprise, super admins have full access to content across all branches which could be problematic if not properly managed or governed by principles set out by both parties involved. END"}
{"prompt":"ROSALIND\n10:37 \nI can, Ryan, I can tell you the way that we handle the courses here so that me and CFS don't buck heads. We use the categories. So if you click on industry.\nROSALIND\n10:54 \nYeah, we use those categories to make sure we're working. But there have been instances where Crystal accidentally deleted one of my courses. So those kinds of things can happen especially early on as you coming in as a new admin. So I did not realize that we share the same admin portal and that sharing of the admin portal is the danger to me because a lot of the root stuff that we do may not work for you.\nRYAN\n11:29 \nYeah, I completely agree. And that's yeah, I'm 100 percent there. I don't know necessarily… that we would have like polar differences in what we're trying to accomplish internally and what you all are doing with the customer training. I don't think, I mean, I don't think there would be a lot of differences or huge differences.\nPayment Gateway\nRYAN\n11:53 \nBut if there's even like one or two things that we need to be able to accomplish for our internal customers or for our internal employees, if it doesn't align with the way that you have it set up externally or the way that you have interlocks, learn, set up, then it's a no go pretty much unless we could find a work around.\nPayment Gateway ends\nRYAN\n12:14 \nBut I mean if, like if your business cases, you have to have it this way for customers and we needed a different way, then that's not that's a no go pretty much. Is that, does that sound correct? Alia?\nMARIAH\n12:27 \nWell, can I jump in there… some clarity? So, I mean, I don't wanna, the only thing that I think needs to be a consideration here is the shared admin space.\nPayment Gateway\nMARIAH\n12:39 \nYou could have different pages, different catalogs, different experiences, different sign on settings with extended enterprise, everything. It's all kind of managed in the same space. But when you go here to extended enterprise for each domain, you can configure your own settings. So I don't wanna say that like you would be confined to their configuration, you can set up your own configuration, but it's just, are you all okay with all of the data being in one place?\nCustom Reports\nMARIAH\n13:12 \nAll of the courses being in one place, when you go to run reports, you're gonna need to run reports based off of your branch so that it's your users so that, but you could create your own experiences in your own courses, right? And it could be totally separate, but it all would live together as like one happy family.\nCustom Reports ends\nROSALIND\n13:33 \nOne of the issues that CFS brought up was that they were not able to control having like password changes be set from our email address and stuff like that. So… if a user requests something, it's coming from Intralox learning instead of CFS. And I thought, I mean there's not a setting in there where they should have it come from themselves instead of us. So things like that, other than storage.\nRYAN\n14:13 \nSo, I think our two main things, our two main concerns would be… content configuration or course configuration and data. So… if, like if at the root… configuration or whatever the root level, root domain level, if a configuration is set for a specific course setting that trickles down to all of the child domains. Is that, that's not correct?\nMARIAH\n14:52 \nYou would have your own courses and you would be able to configure the settings for your course. Specifically. Now, if it's the shared content, the same content, there would be duplicate courses because you would need your course with your settings and they would have their course with their settings.\nRYAN\n15:09 \nOkay. That's interesting. Okay.\nQUENTIN\n15:13 \nLet me ask this question real quick. So the way I understand that, you know, we're getting credit for, you know, both contracts in terms of, you know, quantities of scale and stuff like that. If we actually were to share this, would we have to merge these two together?\nPayment Gateway\nALIA\n15:35 \nCan you elaborate a little bit further?\nQUENTIN\n15:37 \nSo, I mean, we're going to have two totally different contracts, correct? The way it's set up. But if we're you know, not… my understanding, maybe I'm incorrect here. When I look at the quote, you know, it's talking about this extended enterprise. But are we saying that we would be piggy backing off of what we currently have in place for that? Or is that still?\nALIA\n15:59 \nThe existing proposal that was sent is for a separate instance with its own extended enterprise managed by the trim team?\nQUENTIN\n16:10 \nRight. But aren't, we talking about leveraging that same… I guess that route behind it all or am I just completely?\nRYAN\n16:20 \nYeah, that's the, that's Quentin that you're right? That's the question that we're trying to get to. So right now, our plan would be to have, you know, our instance, the Laitram internal training instance and interlocks learn would still exist as its own independent instance of the platform of the software. Interlocks learn also has their extended enterprise, CFS institute and all that we would need an extended enterprise as well, which would be for later machinery. What we're trying to figure out is could potentially internally, we, instead of having our own independent instance, could we merge into the interlocks learn environment on one contract, one instance as one of their extended enterprises? Does that answer your question?\nQUENTIN\n17:13 \nI think so. I mean that's what I'm trying to get at like if we're gonna share, are we trying to merge together and work together under one contract? Or we're still keeping this separate regardless?\nRYAN\n17:24 \nIf, if well, I'll let Alia, answer that. I would think it would be one one contract because we would just be an extended enterprise under interlocks. Learn. If we went that direction.\nALIA\n17:37 \nIf you went to that direction. So part of the visual that Mariah was showcasing is if you decide to extend off of Intralox, is, what are the pros and cons around that and what are the limitations but where the teams have to kinda work together to kinda reconfigure the naming and whatnot, the other option is to have a separate instance in a separate contract and extend off of that with machinery?\nPricing\nRYAN\n18:09 \nOkay. So my only other question, well… I guess my other big question is okay. So users, we load users, internal employees from our HRIS data into let's say again, if we were on the interlocks learn instance that's you know, we have 3,700 people, but I know we're on an active licensing model or an active user model. I think we were on in our.\nALIA\n18:50 \nAnd…\nRYAN\n18:52 \nIt's a 1,000, right? Yeah. So we don't what's that?\nALIA\n18:57 \nJust recapping you have around 3,800 employees plus. And then what we landed is based on what you've seen from a monthly active user perspective, landed more around a 1,000 given that.\nRYAN\n19:10 \nYeah, yeah, because I think the most we saw in a given month was 700, around 700 or something like that.\nPricing ends\nRYAN\n19:19 \nBut anyways, the data that's loaded the user profiles that are loaded, those are a part of the root domain. So all employee data that's going into from the all employee data from HRIS, which I don't know that we're loading any, you know, personally or not personally identifiable, but what's the word sensitive information out of Oracle? I don't think that we are… but well, besides maybe employee ID, I don't know how widely known that is, but anyways, all of that would be accessible to anybody who was a super admin or an admin at the root domain.\nALIA\n20:03 \nThat is correct.\nRYAN\n20:05 \nThat's a little concerning if depending on the data that we ever were to load, but I mean, you know, because.\nQUENTIN\n20:11 \nBut wouldn't we be the super user?\nRYAN\n20:16 \nRosalind is, but she's not in human resources.\nQUENTIN\n20:21 \nOkay. I mean, anybody can see a employee number anyway right now. So that's not sensitive. Now, if you start putting sensitive information there, then sure.\nRYAN\n20:33 \nYeah, that's what I'm saying. I thought an employee ID was an example, but any, I mean, I think the bigger point is any PII or sensitive data that's loaded in there.\nPayment Gateway\nRYAN\n20:43 \nI don't again, I don't think we load any sensitive data. But if there was ever a need to load something that didn't need to be accessible by other admins could see that in the route domain. Yeah. Okay. And also, so, so loadiloading those people into the route domain that's going to impact the licensing numbers that interlocks learn.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ryan raised concerns about user profiles loaded from HRIS being accessible by super admins or admins at root domain which could include sensitive information such as PII; however he noted they don’t currently load any such data into Interlocks Learn platform so this should not pose a problem unless necessary in future scenarios.\n• Quentin asked if merging both contracts was an option for sharing this information; Alia clarified that a separate instance with its own extended enterprise could be managed by the Trim team instead.  END"}
{"prompt":"RYAN\n20:48 \nSo if somebody is inactive, they're never going to count a license against you. So it's not going to increase your cost. Additionally if they were to come back into the organization, their profile is created and their history is there, but also maybe for auditing or tracking, or for historical purposes, at some point down the line, you might want to pull that data from Docebo.\nCertifications ends\nRYAN\n21:09 \nSo all we would recommend is that you inactivate the user, having multiple like thousands of inactive people, isn't gonna slow down or provide any latency to the system. So that's really our recommendation at all times unless you're like, hey, we absolutely, for some very specific reason do need to delete these folks. I don't really talk about that too much. But as I understand it, it's manual. I don't know if there's an API to do that deletion activity to be to…\nNAREN\n21:38 \nOn, on the, in activating the user or the data of the user. So say, for example, we call the API and deactivate the user. Okay? The next time that the user tries to log in, our, into our platform… and if there is an API call that is made directly from that user account, will it activate by default or will it, will we have to activate first? And then do the API call? And.\nRYAN\n22:16 \nI totally understand the, and I'll get a clarification on order of operations. So.\nNAREN\n22:20 \nSo that we can implement something intelligent, you know, say, for example, the user is inactive for the last two weeks, we will just reactivate that account into Saba, and whenever they come back again, we will just call the API and you activate it.\nPricing\nNAREN\n22:37 \nSo if the user is inactivated for, you know, not even using the system for several months, we save some costs on the license and, you know, activate it next time, right?\nRYAN\n22:50 \nYeah. And even then, so even if they're active in the rent, even if you keep the profile active, like in terms of an intelligent workflow, if that person doesn't log in now, there's always a bit of risk, right? Like, hey, they're active, they could log in for whatever reason. Typically once someone's done with the program, though they're probably not gonna log back in. So the only time they consume a license is if they log in during a particular month. So if you have somebody who's left the organization and you do keep them active, the only risk is if they log in for some random reason.\nPricing ends\nRYAN\n23:20 \nBut if they're not part of a program, they're likely not gonna come back to that part of the website, but also understanding customers don't want that risk introduced, right? So deactivate is typically the route we go. So I mean, I say on the activate API, you guys can call from there. And then if and then I'm just gonna write a little statement here. If user comes back… and API call against their profile… to log in… profile to log in. What is order of operation? What is best? Order of operation? Perfect. Awesome. Let me see if I can get an answer there. APIs aren't my forte. So I know about them, but I wanna make sure I'm getting you accurate information because they are your four.\nNAREN\n24:23 \nThe last point I wanted to tell was that we are in tremendous pressure from the security team were on the privacy team telling that if the user meets a certain criteria, you know, inactivated for so much time and program has entered blah blah blah, certain criteria. We will have to actually delete the user from each of the third party system and that is becoming our. So it is not an active user. It is usually inactive user, you know, not using the system for maybe a year or maybe six months, they say that delayed it and they are asking us to push for Automation for it. But if the third party doesn't like you don't have an Automation, how do we deal with it? Is something that we have to think about? It is not very urgent, Ryan, but we to keep that in our mind to see how to do it and maybe document and see whether I can do something in the core part here, right?\nRYAN\n25:33 \nMakes total sense. And I'm just not sure if there is an API out there to delete. So I can ask that as well. So I have a lot of questions. I'll get some, at least some preliminary answers and we can continue the conversation for sure, get it squared away in no problem. So I…\nIntegrations\nNAREN\n25:47 \nTake that.\nRYAN\n25:48 \nDown. So I guess… what was that? So instead of kind of asking, is there a reporting mechanism for API calls? I think maybe if we drive towards that third data snowflakes side of things?\nNAREN\n26:03 \nYeah, I get some.\nRYAN\n26:04 \nAnswers there. And then I'll ask about the inactive, the activated users. Is there, you know, an API to deactivate? Is there an API to reactivate if they come back in? And then the deletion API, is there's something to do, we can do there, you know, with API or is it manual so I can get all of those answers? I know I have a few minutes left.\nIntegrations ends\nRYAN\n26:26 \nI don't have a hard stop more so that's okay if we're over on my part, but I want to respect your time and make sure. Are you okay to go a few minutes over or are you?\nNAREN\n26:35 \nHow that all? Unfortunately, there is anything else that I wanted to ask?\nWrap-Up\nRYAN\n26:44 \nNo problem. Mine was really, so.\nNAREN\n26:48 \nYeah. You have any questions? Please go ahead.\nRYAN\n26:50 \nYeah. Yeah. So a couple of things. So, I know you wanted us to kind of keep you updated. So… in regards to Vanessa Jackson at, I apologize, I didn't mean to keep you out of the Loop there miscommunication. It was not intentional.\nWrap-Up ends\nNAREN\n27:07 \nNo.\nRYAN\n27:08 \nThat, that seems like a good project but it's definitely a very minor, you know, small area of the organization. So understanding that. So we've only had two conversations with Vanessa one in September, one earlier this month, very much. Hey, this is what Docebo does. This is how you could… you know, provide a program to your learners and just answering her question. So there's nothing moving very fast. There. It was more just her exploring the system certainly can, if you would like, I could make an introduction there. If you wanna talk to her more about our relationship or anything like that?\nNAREN\n27:41 \nNo, I think when I say expert, so I can connect with, I think, no, no, no problem at all. And the reason I tried to do that was try to send you a mail regarding that is because we should not confuse. There should not be any confusion between us, you know?\nAbout Docebo\nNAREN\n28:01 \nOkay, because I try to… market to wherever I can within the organization to see where we can use and all that. Unfortunately, we don't have a decision yet on the, and the people and culture part, where in, we were asking for this one. We are still struggling on that account. I think the one of the aspects, there was something around… yeah, something around the implementation part. You know, say, for example, they were saying, why is the implementation being charged? Because that is too expensive? You know, why are we having implementation calls? Because we have a zoo, give us free implementation depending because of, because we believe that it is the partnership that is important, blah, blah blah.\nOnboarding\nNAREN\n29:07 \nAnd so in some conversation on that, it didn't move forward either way. But I think it is one of those balance filing thing, you know?\nRYAN\n29:20 \nYeah.\nNAREN\n29:22 \nThe implementation part, for example, we go to the, in a complete one, right? Say we talk to the understand the requirements, make sure that we implement, and then we go live when all that, the whole journey part of it.\nOnboarding ends\nNAREN\n29:38 \nSo, PNC is concerned on that telling that, okay, we are, you know, going on this with the Mega scale with, you know, once we implement, we will never do it again with the go on for a decade. So why so much of pains on the implementation cost? So that is something that they were talking but they haven't… decided anything. But I was just wanted to tell you that this is one of the concerns that they had telling that, you know, because the implementation cost itself is so much that on it really impacts, it is almost the same as the license cost. Maybe. Okay. No problem.\nNext Steps\nRYAN\n30:26 \nI definitely, I know you have to run on. That makes total sense. I don't wanna… to, I guess diminish it. I've taken a note. I can talk internally not that we can necessarily do anything but I do wanna make sure folks are aware. Can we book? Can we book maybe 15 or 30 minutes early next week, just pick this conversation up about the other project. I think there's a lot of stuff we should chat about in terms of long term partnership, that kind of thing?\nNAREN\n30:53 \nYes, I… will. Yeah. Next week, the, we have workshops starting next week till the end of the month. Okay? Is it is once a year thing? Okay? So I'll be busy from tomorrow till… the almost like a second of March.\nRYAN\n31:17 \nOkay. I'm out that first week of first second and third. So we'd wanna look at the week of the sixth, what?\nNAREN\n31:23 \nLike Tuesday or Wednesday?\nRYAN\n31:26 \nSay seven to eight at this time?\nNAREN\n31:29 \nJust a minute, Tuesday or Wednesday off?\nRYAN\n31:34 \nMarch seventh or eighth?\nNAREN\n31:40 \nOkay. I'm okay. For.\nRYAN\n31:44 \nTuesday at this time would be eight a M, my time at six 30.\nNext Steps ends\nNAREN\n31:47 \nThe same same, yeah.\nRYAN\n31:49 \nLet me send that out. And just before you go, just a quick point on that other project. So what we really wanna do 10 from a Docebo perspective is I know the trials coming up. I know that we're going to kind of start the, what we would call internally, the bake off, right? And we're putting where we're going. We have two ovens, which one bake it better and we need to look at that, you know, over the course of the next month, I was speaking with scenesia a little bit earlier this week and she said, and then I would love if you could maybe assist here. So, what we would want to do before that trial kicks off is Docebo really wants from my perspective and from our executive perspective to get on site with you guys in maybe Milwaukee with senesia with the team with everybody and sit down in a room and go over what the trial experience looks like.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They scheduled a meeting for Tuesday at 8 AM.\n• PNC raised concerns about implementation cost being too high compared with license cost but no decision has been made yet.

I can send you a short two minute video just briefly showing sort of what we've shown today.\nOnboarding\nMALLORY\n14:09 \nAnd yeah, perfect. Excellent. All right. Of course, we, whatever we can do to support and make sure that, you know, the key team that's going to be, you know, handling this project outside of yourselves are also on board and they understand that solution will fit your requirements. We wanna make sure everyone's comfortable with that.\nOnboarding ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n14:31 \nYou know, I'm all about partnering. This is not a master server relationship. I'm all about partnering with all of our vendors and we're basically turning back the last couple of years because we're very much been the driver of that. But, you know, we don't know everything and we're not saying we do. And the really important thing is us to get really key partners involved in our business and live and breathe it and everything else that goes. I'm sure we can get you out to mount Drew at some stage. So you can actually, you know, have a touch and feel of that. And we've got something in the we're going to actually have an open day in the Ein the coming weeks as well. So you might want to jump, you know, if there's any other video stuff we can made marketing digital marketing person and also help with that. So that'll be great.\nMALLORY\n15:26 \nYeah, definitely. I mean, I, I'd love that would be great. So Roger make sure you pass me the information of that and I'll see if I can fit in my schedule and hit out there and have a look that'll be awesome.\nANDYKIMPTON\n15:39 \nI did watch the demonstration.\nRICK\n15:41 \nDo…\nANDYKIMPTON\n15:42 \nGo on.\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n15:43 \nWhat, what's this one that you had in Victoria? And?\nANDYKIMPTON\n15:46 \nThat was?\nMALLORY\n15:47 \nYeah, that look great. So, awesome. Fabulous. Okay. So in terms of I'll quickly run through what, you know, course work might look like for a learner, it's very clean. Simple. Easy. You can create different learning plans.\nLearning Plans\nMALLORY\n16:03 \nSo it really guides them into different content, E learning. You can do workshops, a combination of webinars, face to face, whatever it is that you require. And then the actual course player itself is very simple and clean. So you'll be able to see here the course player and you can have the playlist of the content that they're going to consume.\nLearning Plans ends\nMALLORY\n16:22 \nAnd you can even make it simpler if you wanted to and just have that course player available to them. And then as part of that course training, you can provide, you know, maybe additional files that are part of the training, but they supplement things like product manuals or, you know, process documents or safety law, white papers and things like that.\nCoach & Share\nMALLORY\n16:44 \nAnd then you can have questions and answers available as part of the platform as well. So they can have that conversation and engage with their peers and have that wider discussion around what the, what is this equipment use for best practices? And things like that. They can start that conversation in a course itself.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Andy suggested that Mallory could present a five minute snapshot of the experience at an upcoming board meeting. \n• Rick offered to jump in for 15 minutes during the presentation, if necessary. \n• Mallory proposed recording a two-minute video showcasing what they had discussed today as well as providing additional support for those managing the project outside of their team.  \n• Andy mentioned partnering with vendors and having an open day where people can have hands-on experiences with equipment being used by their company, potentially accompanied by marketing videos created by Mallory's team.

Okay, good.\nBEN\n0:55 \nStuff.\nARCHIE\n0:56 \nWell, we can have a call later on this afternoon.\nBEN\n1:00 \nYeah, yeah, no one of them on the access group or the provider that we currently use anyway.\nARCHIE\n1:08 \nOkay. All right. Happy to know.\nBEN\n1:09 \nIf he's got any issues, you can just revert back to.\nARCHIE\n1:12 \nSure. Perfect. Good stuff. So, we're waiting for a couple. So that's a good. I mean, we can send a recording of this call over as well. So.\nBEN\n1:26 \nPlease mate, if you don't mind?\nARCHIE\n1:28 \nAll good. No problem.\nED\n1:31 \nHi guys. Hey, Ben. Good to meet you.\nBEN\n1:33 \nHi, you. Okay?\nED\n1:34 \nYeah, good. Thanks. All. Go ahead.\nBEN\n1:36 \nStuff. Good stuff.\nARCHIE\n1:38 \nWe do a, we do a full round of intros obviously when everyone gets here, but as the sales directly, he's my boss and then we put Andrea as well. Discuss the GPR that now. I have a question on.\nSmall Talk\nBEN\n1:53 \nAwesome. Who's the other one?\nARCHIE\n1:58 \nYou, you know, Sam.\nED\n2:00 \nYeah.\nARCHIE\n2:00 \nEveryone loves him.\nBEN\n2:04 \nI'm only playing some.\nARCHIE\n2:05 \nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nSAMUEL\n2:07 \nI got a beat on the MS.\nED\n2:09 \nJust so I have to grow out at going out the rest of my facial hair because Sam was getting, so, it's a jealous of the stronger mustache?\nBEN\n2:19 \nYeah, it's a solid mustache, Sam. You built mate.\nED\n2:26 \nGod, what's his name from top go? No maverick was the main one wasn't he…\nED\n2:37 \nYeah, yeah.\nARCHIE\n2:40 \nYeah, I mean, I struggle with facial hair in general, so.\nBEN\n2:43 \nMe mate, I've…\nARCHIE\n2:44 \nDown.\nBEN\n2:45 \nI've been growing mine for 25 years… was?\nSmall Talk ends\nARCHIE\n2:52 \nSo, so, so, who from your side is join us? So, a few on the calendar invite. So we've got panel. We got Jan and Ken.\nBEN\n3:02 \nYes. Is that everyone? Yes, I'm just gonna send around the messages now.\nARCHIE\n3:06 \nYeah, good.\nBEN\n3:07 \nSo we don't end up embarrassing ourselves too much.\nARCHIE\n3:11 \nSo, so, Andrea, for your… benefits then. So panels the HR, is it HR director or?\nBEN\n3:21 \nYeah. So she's the group HR director. So yeah, she's the big boss of all things HR.\nSAMUEL\n3:29 \nOkay.\nANDREA\n3:29 \nCool.\nARCHIE\n3:30 \nAnd then we've got Kent who is the, IT, the IT.\nBEN\n3:37 \nSo kens the it manager again, he's responsible for the group.\nAbout Docebo\nBEN\n3:42 \nIT, he's based out in Denmark. And then the last one will be Penn. So the last one will be… Jan is the aftermarket director for the group. So he's all things service for the group. So, and it's panel and Jan that have message to say they're running a bit late. They're out in Germany at the minute, something or other out there. So.\nSmall Talk\nARCHIE\n4:11 \nDo you ever, do you ever get out to Denmark at a?\nBEN\n4:16 \nI haven't been to Denmark yet. I'm on my way to Germany in a couple of weeks, a bit out there of some new equipment that we've got… and then the states will probably be next.\nARCHIE\n4:28 \nNice.\nBEN\n4:29 \nDenmark is pretty solid mate, to be fair.\nAbout Docebo\nBEN\n4:32 \nIt's pretty, you know, it's our HQ. So it's all set up there's. No real purpose for me to go out and do anything out there really. So it's mainly Latvia, France, Germany, and the states that I deal with.\nAbout Docebo ends\nARCHIE\n8:43 \nWell, thank you everyone for joining. I know there's a couple of calendars to merge. So I really appreciate that. So just before we sort of get sort of kicked off, really no real need for me and Sam to introduce ourselves because we've all spoken before, just want to introduce Ed from our side and Andrea. So I'll let Ed and Andrea introduce themselves really quickly.\nED\n9:09 \nThanks, Archie. I'll go first. So, yeah, my name is, I'm a director for the U. K and audit been with co for about four and a half years. So I work with Archie. So I thought I'd be a good call for me to join just so we can progress things quicker if possible. So, yeah, good to meet everyone. And then, yeah, join by Andrea.\nANDREA\n9:30 \nHello, Ryan. My name is Andrea star. I'm the privacy council at the table. So I support in this case, Archie and for any GDPR queries or doubts that you might have around our solution?\nARCHIE\n9:48 \nThanks so much. So really the purpose of this call then is obviously to ask the questions that you had. I caught up with Ben this morning. So got a brief understanding of the types of questions. What I will say is that Sam and Andrea both have a call at half past. So if we can ask any GDPR related questions and platform technical functional questions towards the start of the call, that would be great.\nAbout Docebo\nARCHIE\n10:18 \nAnd then towards the second half of the call, I know we've got an hour schedule, might not need it all to be completely honest. And then we can talk about more of the contract side of things if that's okay. So in just in terms of sort of kicking it off then for, no, I know you had a question around the GDPR having some users in Europe, having some users over in the states. So it'll be good to understand a little bit more about that, a little bit more about the concern. And then I'll hand it over to Andrea to give an answer that's alright?\nPERNILLE\n10:51 \nI'm familiar with the european GDPR and of course, it's important that you covered that. But as I understand, it is important if you have employee data in us that there's a local server… having these data or holding these data, I don't know that whether that is correct, and I need your advice in that manner.\nANDREA\n11:19 \nI can. And…\nPERNILLE\n11:21 \nRight now, it's it is basically the same situation for UK because you're not a part of you anymore.\nANDREA\n11:26 \nYeah, it's a good point. Feel free to interrupt me when you prefer if I misunderstood the question. But basically when we have customers that are global, so with multinational full footprint. And at the moment, I would say the preferred data location and data storage is, I would say always Europe. Given the would say cross board data transfer concerns or issues. So we usually store all your data including or any sort of backup or business recovery data centers in Europe. I think we have one data center in Germany, one in ireland, but we can double check around that. And in terms of, so all your employees data will be stored in that environment international, I would say if, yeah, so I would say I will stop here to see if there are any specific questions around that or clarification that might be needed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jan is the aftermarket director for the group\n• Pernille asked if it's important to have a local server if they have employee data \n END"}
{"prompt":"ARCHIE\n12:43 \nI think just to add to that as well, I mean, we've got a lot of company customers that we work with that have a global workforce that also training their customers that might be global as well. So it's definitely not a, not an unusual case if that makes sense. So, yeah, if generally our customers use the european either an.\nED\n13:04 \nOr…\nARCHIE\n13:05 \nJust outside of Dublin, the data centre to get around that sort of the GDPR compliance.\nPERNILLE\n13:12 \nSo what you're saying is that there's no need for a specific server or no way. No need for, you could say dividing the employees between servers?\nARCHIE\n13:25 \nNo, no to my understanding. No, Andrea, unless you've got any, anything to add there.\nANDREA\n13:30 \nCorrect. Basically on our, we say a customer base we haven't never needed to say split the customer base given the fact the U. S state laws are not so stringent at the moment, it might be in the future. But right now, the key point is just in Europe.\nAbout Docebo ends\nPERNILLE\n13:51 \nThank you.\nARCHIE\n13:55 \nPerfect. So that's the GDPRE, everything okay with the GDPR anymore, sort of data hosting questions at all?\nARCHIE\n14:09 \nNo, I take that. Silence.\nPERNILLE\n14:11 \nHave nothing. Okay.\nARCHIE\n14:12 \nPerfect. That is a good thing. Perfect. Thank you so much for Andrea for that. Cool. So, I understand that there was a few questions around the, or there potentially could be a few questions around the integration piece.\nIntegrations\nARCHIE\n14:26 \nSo, Sam, I'll let you cover these. Are there any integration questions about potentially integrating with the a D? Can I don't know if you want to sort of ask any questions there at all?\nKENT.KIRKEGAARD\n14:39 \nI think we had a meeting some time ago where we discussed the technical setup regarding backup and stuff like that.\nIntegrations ends\nKENT.KIRKEGAARD\n14:48 \nAnd I think well, no, the only thing we are interested in is that we can use the ad as your ad integration so that we can have single sign on and we are protected by mfa using the Microsoft account. So from my side, no further questions your on.\nPERNILLE\n15:08 \nThink, I think from my side, I think first of all, it's very important to link it to a D so that it's actually that from a D, the accesses is approved or given. But then at a later stage, I would like the HR system to be the master and then sending you could say the employees directly from the HR system into the CEO and the supplier that we're currently evaluating that had, has that possibility so that when you choose LMS, you would go into the CEO as if it was an LMS system in the HR system. That would mean that you wouldn't have to have, yeah, different accesses. So, so it's just that you are aware that for now because we don't have an HR system, it would be from ad that the approval or the creation is made later on. It would be another solution.\nSAMUEL\n16:11 \nAnd I'd like to ask in terms of the employee information that is currently stored on a user profile with the attribute statements does not have the coverage that would be expected to be able to maybe like automate some of the information in terms of user groupings, things like job title, for example, does that information currently sit on a?\nPERNILLE\n16:40 \nI think that is in the ad now and it should be because the, right now the a D is the master.\nSAMUEL\n16:46 \nOkay. Okay. Perfect. Yeah.\nKENT.KIRKEGAARD\n16:50 \nYeah. And when it comes to specifically the titles, we see that we have many different titles for the same positions depending on what country then. So, but I think that's a detail, but still…\nIntegrations\nSAMUEL\n17:07 \nThat's that's not a problem at all since that can be included in some of the logic within our system for managing the groups in terms of the actual data sitting on Azure and being able to be brought into the system upon log in when it's authorizing them here.\nIntegrations ends\nSAMUEL\n17:28 \nI'm coming to my admin settings within that SAML app, but there can be specific update or creation of users from that Azure SAML, and that can include particular custom fields that you have. And then you'd be identifying the attribute statement kinda endpoint there. So that when that XML is passed over, it's able to grab that and create or update those users as needed.\nJAN\n18:04 \nPerfect.\nARCHIE\n18:05 \nAny more sort of platform related questions at all. Take that silence as a good thing. Again? Perfect. So, I mean, Sam and Andrea, I don't know if you want to jump off now. I know you've got a call at half past. So, yeah, thank you very much for joining. I appreciate that.\nSAMUEL\n18:24 \nI stay in the background for now we.\nANDREA\n18:27 \nThank you, everyone bye.\nARCHIE\n18:29 \nAnd thank you. Brilliant. So in terms of any other questions then, I know there were some particular questions… about the contract in et cetera. I don't know if anyone wants to lead with that, then I don't know if you want, if you want to sort of pass the battle in there at all?\nBEN\n18:48 \nYeah. So I mean, we was guys myself me, Ken and Jan met the other day and I think there was just a couple of little fine details just to sort of run over Jan. Do you want, was there anything from you in particular… not to throw you?\nSAMUEL\n19:10 \nI'm desperately searching for my notes. Yeah, hang on.\nAbout Docebo\nJAN\n19:15 \nFor sure. Remember some of it, but I think.\nJAN\n19:22 \nI think… I, yeah.\nSAMUEL\n19:27 \nRight. But I…\nJAN\n19:28 \nThink what in terms of the contract and it's actually panel who will be the owner of the system? And so global are in the company, which is really good. So, so I guess the first thing is that our question, but I think we got that answer that we will host, the, it will be our mother company in Denmark, Alan, as that will be the contract owner and we will still do the business with the CEO in UK. Is that correctly understood?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Archie, Andrea and Samuel discussed the GDPR compliance when it comes to data hosting.\n• Kent mentioned that they are interested in using Microsoft account for single sign on and MFA protection. \n• Pernille noted that HR system should be the master sending employees directly into Docebo LMS from HR system once implemented at a later stage. \n• They do not currently have an HR system.  \n \n END"}
{"prompt":"ARCHIE\n20:03 \nThat's correct? Yeah, absolutely.\nJAN\n20:04 \nOkay, good. And… then panel before we move into the specific about the users and all of that, did you have any comments request into the contract itself?\nPERNILLE\n20:18 \nBasically not, it was more on the user basis and more on, you could say conditions for how many users and licenses. Yeah.\nPricing ends\nARCHIE\n20:28 \nPerfect. So I think that'll be a good thing to tackle now. So what exactly is the sort of the question, maybe concern about the usage? Is it potentially, I know Ben was mentioning potentially doing that on maybe a phase roll out approach. It'll be just good to understand a little bit more about that.\nPERNILLE\n20:46 \nIt was basically that currently we have started a recruitment for learning and development manager, who will be the overall responsible for the system. It will be an individual or a colleague recruiting in Latvia. So in the HR department there reporting into me. So what we will start with before that is that Ben of courses is responsible for the first step of implementation. So, so this was the original plan and this will still be the plan. So we will need the licenses necessary for rolling it out in after month. The next step will then be that we will include this for all our white color staff and managers. And the last step is then that we need to consider how to enroll all to blue color staff, other blue color stuff because they don't have an email. And that is the thing that we have been discussing. We can't also whether we should then grand an email, have a license for Microsoft. But that is the third step. So that means that for now it would be a little stupid to buy a lot of licenses that we would not need. And that being said, then I think that we of course, are interested in still having… good conditions for when we then buy the next part of the license.\nARCHIE\n22:16 \nI see perfect. And.\nJAN\n22:18 \nJust as one can come to that, the 100 percent support toward analysis. And just in parallel with those three faces service white collar and blue color, there will also be customers facing in.\nPERNILLE\n22:32 \nAnd that would be a part of the first.\nJAN\n22:34 \nThe first step, yes, to have licenses ready for that.\nSAMUEL\n22:39 \nOne thing I want to add Archie from a user provisioning and access point of view, we've discussed kind of single sign on integration. You can also have hybrid log on in the sense that it's a user name and password as well as single sign on.\nNotifications\nSAMUEL\n22:56 \nWe have many customers that have email lists learners. All you need to get access to the platform is a unique user name and a password. If they don't have an email address that's attached to that account. Of course, they can't receive email based Notifications. But within our platform, we do have a notification window that could give them updates in terms of you've, been enrolled in this training. You need to do this has expired and they'd be able to see that after they've logged in but particularly for users that aren't part of ad or that don't have email addresses, you could still from day one support their access to the platform as well as control the access to the content, the actual display of the platform.\nNotifications ends\nSAMUEL\n23:43 \nSo the user experience, if you are a customer or a contractor or an employee, they could have different dashboards when they log in.\nPERNILLE\n23:54 \nOkay. That's interesting. So good to know that we also have that possibility. So it's not reliant on a Microsoft license but still also in order for us… to be realistic in the workload for a new learning and development manager and do it the right way, we would need to face it and do a facing.\nAbout Docebo\nARCHIE\n24:22 \nNaturally, and to be completely honest, the majority of our customers do roll it out on a phase approach. It is a big project.\nAbout Docebo ends\nARCHIE\n24:29 \nWe completely appreciate that and we will be with you and we will advise you on that during the implementation. So that's not a problem at all. And we're very used to that as well. I mean, in terms of Ed, can sort of back me up and add some information in a bit.\nPricing\nARCHIE\n24:45 \nBut in terms of what we can do now, I know that we've given some discounts. Now previously, what we've said is, okay, the discount is for the first purchase only because you can upgrade your plan at any time through our account manager team. We can't guarantee not now what we do with some of our customers, not all of them, but some of them is to have a step approach to this. So what we can say is in the contract, we can write it in the contract. So maybe you start off for the first six months for example, on a 500 active user plan. Then after the first six months, you then expect to open that out to the blue color workers, for example, that's going, you expect that to increase the user numbers by 500 users, for example.\nPricing ends\nARCHIE\n25:36 \nSo if you know, what, if you know, sort of when then you can upgrade your plan. So that's what we do with some customers. It'll be good to sort of get your feedback on that and what the ideal situation would be for, from yourself.\nPERNILLE\n25:53 \nI think that would be a good solution because we of course, want to go that way… and include everybody.\nPayment Gateway\nPERNILLE\n26:02 \nSo, so it's just that we don't pay the big ticket and not use it from the beginning? Yeah. Okay.\nARCHIE\n26:12 \nI mean, and…\nPERNILLE\n26:14 \nWhat I'm hearing there is that then the discount that was offered when for having the 10 percent or something that is actually also a part of a facing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Archie proposed a phased roll-out approach to the implementation of the platform for white collar and blue color staff.\n• Ben is responsible for the first step of implementation. \n• Samuel added that users can have different dashboards when they log in, with single sign on integration or hybrid login options available. Notifications are also available within the platform for those without email addresses attached to their accounts.\n• Jan suggested full support towards analysis of these steps as well as licenses ready for customers facing in parallel with white collar and blue color staff accesses. \n• Pernille noted that it would be wise not to buy too many licenses at once before including all blue color staff.\n• They have started a recruitment for learning and development manager, who will be the overall responsible for the system. END"}
{"prompt":"ARCHIE\n26:26 \nExactly that. Exactly that. So yeah, we can write that all within the contract. So for the first maybe six months, I don't know, do you have sort of timelines for this when you're expected to sort of roll that out on a phase basis?\nPERNILLE\n26:39 \nI think that currently, what we're expecting is that to have a learning and development manager in place just before the summer holidays… and then that individual need to land and be on boarded, but starting up with creating a plan and content just… after the summer, meaning August, and that would be for the white color stuff.\nOnboarding ends\nPERNILLE\n27:05 \nAnd then expectedly including blue color staff in the new year.\nARCHIE\n27:11 \nIn the new year? Okay?\nPERNILLE\n27:12 \nAnd then for the first phase, that would be, I guess immediately when and yeah.\nARCHIE\n27:20 \nPerfect. So, so working back from that, so just to go through it so logically then, so in the new year, that's when you expect all of the, all of the staff members to have access to training.\nOnboarding\nARCHIE\n27:33 \nSo working back from that then, so it will take roughly sort of eight to 12 weeks for fill implementation of the, in the initial phase. Now, obviously we can go through the implementation plan, not a problem at all. So that takes us to April sort of may time.\nPricing\nARCHIE\n27:52 \nSo just before the summer, so 500 users will that will do you for until sort of the new year? Yeah. So what we could potentially do is say, okay, you've got 500 users up until the, up until the new year that's when we up your plan by 500. So in the contract, we can write in the new year, you will get access to another 500 licenses. You'll be able to get that same discount as well for the whole of the whole of the three year, the three year agreement that we have. So that that's how we do it with a lot of customers.\nPricing ends\nARCHIE\n28:35 \nWhat we can do is I can write that up and I can send that over for you to look at how that would look like in a contract for.\nPERNILLE\n28:42 \nThat would be great. Yeah, you agree?\nJAN\n28:45 \nYes, yes. Yes. I like the facing approach here and I'm a big friend of discounting.\nPricing\nARCHIE\n28:53 \nI…\nJAN\n28:53 \nExactly that. No jokes aside. So my question was mainly… is it 500 plus 500? Or can we face it in because it is two larger chunks, maybe it fits us quite well. I don't know. But is there an opportunity to do it in three phases?\nPricing ends\nJAN\n29:12 \nAlso? Why is that not really? And I'm also asking my own our own team here a little bit is just if the opportunity is there when we see the contract, when we sit and look at it?\nARCHIE\n29:25 \nSure, absolutely. I think because we don't do this with every customer, to be completely honest, we try to stick to a maximum of two phases for complete transparency especially because we're offering the discount for that higher bracket that we don't usually offer to be completely honest.\nPricing\nARCHIE\n29:44 \nAnd our next plan up from our 500 plan is our 1,000 plan anyway. So it would be on a two on a two phase.\nJAN\n29:52 \nAll right. So my next question there is then, and I'm not sure I understood that correctly. So when you buy a plan from you for 500 or 1,000 users, then there is some… hyper, some implementation resources included in that. So, but does it come with… a higher amount, a higher level of implementation? If you buy 1,500, and how is that influenced by the face to face model?\nARCHIE\n30:28 \nIt's a, it's a, that's a great question. So I think from an implementation standpoint, it would be more cost effective to go for the 500 first and then phase it up to the 1,000. Now, the reason being is that onboarding for our 500 user plan because it's generally a smaller project is it's 2,750 pounds rather than when it jumps up to that a 1,000 user plan straight off the bat, it's a 16 week, it's a longer implementation. It's more weekly sessions and that works out at 10,200 pounds. So as you can see, it's more cost effective. You're still getting the same training pretty much but it's just at a different scale. So it's a great question. And personally, what we see is that it's more cost effective in the initial setup phase anyway, but you'll still be fully enabled even when you do phase up and do scale up in the new year, you'll still have access to the account management team.\nOnboarding\nARCHIE\n31:30 \nYou'll still have access to your customer success manager. More importantly, so that's their role is really to be able to look after you throughout the whole of the duration of the contract. So they'll be your best point of contact. They'll be able to go through that with you every step of the way. Does that answer your question? The?\nSAMUEL\n31:53 \nYes, it.\nJAN\n31:53 \nDoes. And I actually also just passing the question onto to Ben here because he's the one who knows most about it that whether you are happy with this approach, Ben, in terms of implementation also because one thing is that we are happy about in terms of number of users, but also for the implementation?\nBEN\n32:11 \nI mean from, I think so. So from what I understand, we're doing the 500 user implementation plan first Torch LMS, is that correct? That's correct? Yeah. Okay. And then when we come to once that implementation plans over, we still then get ongoing support from a key accounts manager and a customer success manager. Yeah, that's how accessible. Is that support? How regular? Is that support?\nARCHIE\n32:37 \nYeah. So, I mean, it's really sort of as I went to be completely honest, typically, it's quarterly business reviews with current customers. You'd meet on a quarterly basis to understand any changes to the platform. So platform updates, we update the platform regularly. So being the first to know to tell you about that, but you, you've got direct access to them. It's a dedicated resource from our side, just gonna go ahead and share my screen. So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Archie and Pernille discussed a timeline for implementing training to both white color staff before the summer holidays, and blue color staff in the new year.\n• Archie suggested 500 users up until the new year with an additional 500 licenses available at that time, as well as discounts for the three-year agreement. \n• Jan asked if it was possible to phase out implementation into three phases instead of two, which ARCHIE said would be more cost effective in terms of onboarding resources. \n• Ben inquired about ongoing support from key accounts managers and customer success managers after completion of initial implementation plan; Archie stated this would typically involve quarterly business reviews with current customers to discuss any platform updates or changes. \n• They're expecting to have a learning and development manager in place just before the summer holidays.\n END"}
{"prompt":"BEN\n35:59 \nOkay, brilliant. And obviously, that's great. And obviously we're aspiring to be one of those customers that you never hear from because everything just magically works.\nED\n36:09 \nA good way to.\nBEN\n36:12 \nIt the minimum.\nED\n36:12 \nYou'll have quarterly business reviews and.\nBEN\n36:15 \nAwesome. Awesome. Let's say, for example, three, four weeks, five weeks after implementation, we stumble across a technical problem when we're trying to upload training content or we're trying to onboard people, that sort of thing you just mentioned now that… the customer manager, customer success manager isn't as technical as the implementation, but would we still have access to the implementation team? Would we have access to technical people?\nED\n36:45 \nYeah, absolutely. So that's managed through our support channel and your customer success manager in that instance is almost like your internal advocate. So they'll be the person that ensures that, you know, we're chasing up tickets for you and making sure that we're getting solutions to your challenges. But yeah, you have no less of access to technical resource. Absolutely. It's just with implementation. We're doing the hand holding it through a very structured scheduled process. But yeah, you'll have access to support where we'll help you monitor as well.\nOnboarding ends\nJAN\n37:21 \nOkay. That, is that part of the license fee or is that something that comes on top?\nARCHIE\n37:26 \nSports included absolutely.\nJAN\n37:29 \nAs your contract mentioned, something about hotline that wasn't the word and I don't have the papers here with me and I was a little bit actually curious what that was then if.\nED\n37:41 \nYeah, I enter.\nARCHIE\n37:42 \nMentioned that, I'm not entirely sure what you're referencing in terms of the hotline?\nJAN\n37:48 \nIt just sets and… yeah, keep talking. I'll get my note that's okay. If it's included, it's we don't have to discuss it any further. It was just something that was sent as an option… in the contract papers. Do you remember Ben and an just curious?\nMobile App\nBEN\n38:08 \nNo, I think when you mentioned it to me, it was apps and hotline. I think you mentioned.\nED\n38:16 \nSo I can potentially add a bit more clarity around there. So we base, we have different… support options. 95 percent of our customers are on the standard support which is listed in the MS a, but there is an option to take out premium support which includes the access to have phone support, which is something that isn't included a standard.\nMobile App ends\nED\n38:43 \nSo the hotline is likely just relating to any of the paid for support. The, as I said, 95 is probably more than that. 98 percent of companies have to use the standard support. It's just that we have an offering there if required. And that's I would, I think that's where the hotline is discussed.\nBEN\n39:12 \nJust just to confirm the hotline isn't the only way to contact via phone, is it for support?\nED\n39:18 \nNo, no. So for support, it's all within the platform. So there's a ticketing system and a chat system. So you'll have access to both of those. And we'll work. We'll basically that's the first place to enter your support request. And then once you've gone through this because we need a log of it, that's the minimum thing that we need. And once we've got a log of it, we'll try and support you over, yeah, chat or ticketing system. And then outside of that, we can, for example, if we can't get to the bottom of something, then yeah, we'll have a Zoom call with you and jump on a call that way. But yeah, this is just to have an initial, a log of the incident.\nIntegrations\nARCHIE\n40:03 \nThe ticketing systems all directly built into the admin side of the platform. So I'm I've just hopped into your instance here and it's just in this help center here. So this is your, this is your app inside of the platform in this help center. And then there's an integrated ticketing system.\nIntegrations ends\nARCHIE\n40:19 \nWe use send desk internally, so that's how that's worked. And we work on SL a S as well, which is also in the MS a.\nBEN\n40:30 \nIf all hours fails call Archie.\nARCHIE\n40:32 \nIf all else fails, just give me a call. You got my number. I'll regret saying that for sure.\nSmall Talk\nBEN\n40:38 \nMy favorites now.\nARCHIE\n40:40 \nThere we go. We have been speaking a lot in the last couple of months. So it's all good. We have said as well. When you're in London, we'll meet in.\nBEN\n40:47 \nFor sure for sure.\nED\n40:51 \nAnd also just all jokes aside, yes, like we're here to make sure that this is a success.\nSmall Talk ends\nED\n40:57 \nOne of our key metrics as a company that we have to report on is a retention rates, our renewal rates. So, yeah, all jokes aside. If he, if it's a case, if you do need to call us or whatever, then we're here to make sure that everything is really successful.\nBEN\n41:16 \nI think that's all from my side, anybody else? Anything?\nJAN\n41:25 \nNo, not from my side. I guess what we'll be looking for then… is a kind of a final contract from you guys with what we have been discussing so we can get that reviewed and thing is anything more we need to do invest?\nPERNILLE\n41:47 \nThink that of course, we need an onboarding of the new learning and development manager, but that could be partially covered by Ben also, but they also need to be some kind of support from, to, so, but that's it basically.\nARCHIE\n42:05 \nAbsolutely. No.\nBEN\n42:06 \nThat, that…\nARCHIE\n42:06 \nAll sounds perfect. So, what I'll do is a follow up then I'll go away.\nPricing\nARCHIE\n42:11 \nI'll spin up sort of the final contract if you like factoring in the increases of users in the new year as well, just so you can see what that looks like. From a commercial standpoint, we will stick with the current pricing and the current discounts as well, especially when you move up to that.\nOnboarding\nARCHIE\n42:31 \nSo we'll stick to that throughout the whole of the contract. And in terms of the signature, who would I be best to send that over when we do, when I do have that ready?\nBEN\n42:45 \nYou can either send it to me to forward on or?\nPERNILLE\n42:49 \nYeah, that's fine.\nBEN\n42:50 \nYeah. With you panella?\nPERNILLE\n42:52 \nThat's fine.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They have requested that a new learning and development manager is onboarded as well.\n• Ben will be the contact to send the contract to for signature.  END"}
{"prompt":"ARCHIE\n42:53 \nOkay, perfect. And so, so, was it, was there a question or? Okay. So, and in terms of sort of just so when we can, because we need to allocate the resources on our side as well, of course, to manage the kick off. So in terms of when you would be likely to be able to get the contract sort of signed off when we can sort of start allocating resources and get that kick off.\nNext Steps\nARCHIE\n43:19 \nDo you think we could potentially do that this month this week? Do you think that's reasonable or what would be the sort of the time line?\nBEN\n43:26 \nYeah. Bye.\nPERNILLE\n43:29 \nI think we can decide pretty quickly.\nARCHIE\n43:31 \nOkay, perfect. So, yeah, I'll get that all wrapped up today. I'll get that sent over to Ben.\nNext Steps ends\nARCHIE\n43:36 \nI'll send over there's. Some instructions it will be. I do sign as well so you can actually forward it to another member. We can go from.\nBEN\n43:46 \nBrilliant. Thank you very much.\nJAN\n43:48 \nI have a, I have a question and.\nARCHIE\n43:50 \nOf course.\nJAN\n43:51 \nIt's just because I'm curious to you talk about this eight to something weeks implementation plan.\nLearning Plans\nJAN\n43:58 \nAnd I think as you were saying, a structured plan, can you just quickly on a one page or something show us now what is, actually, what can we expect? What is it? Because we're also updating our strategy plans and our implementation plans just so we can kind of get an idea of what it looks like.\nLearning Plans ends\nARCHIE\n44:14 \nAbsolutely. Let me pull it up here. Just give me one second.\nJAN\n44:24 \nThis first step will be very much on you, Ben and the team over and whoever we can find to support you on that, but.\nARCHIE\n44:33 \nAbsolutely. What I'll do is I'll share you. I'll share a copy of this after the call but this maps out all of the stages of the it's pretty dull.\nOnboarding\nARCHIE\n44:45 \nIt's a word document but it's quite thorough and it maps out exactly the processes through that. So we want they'll be a project kickoff and discovery. So really understanding your business goals, the business drivers internally before this call as well. I myself, Sam will catch up with your solutions deployment manager and your account manager as well just to go over everything. So we're fully ready for that kickoff call. Weeks three to six will then go into the configuration and the validation. So we use a project management tool called the if that has linked out to the university. So the CEB university I'm flicking around my screen a little bit… is our internal customer learning hub.\nOnboarding ends\nARCHIE\n45:38 \nSo… this is, this has all of the information that you will need to successfully set up your platform. So it has a load of how to guides that you can enroll onto and on a step by step basis on how to set up the platform.\nOnboarding\nARCHIE\n45:58 \nSo you can all have access to this account. It's free of charge. It comes with the onboarding services and you'll be heavily supported with this as well as obviously your solutions deployment manager. So that and that's where you'll be doing the most of the learning from the three to six week mark.\nOnboarding ends\nARCHIE\n46:17 \nAnd then we always factor in a soft launch. So maybe a test number of users. So maybe I don't know five or 10 people you might want to select that, roll that out to them internally, get some user generated feedback from that, what's working? What maybe it maybe isn't et cetera.\nOnboarding\nARCHIE\n46:35 \nSo we'll always factor that into your timelines and then that transition. So once you set up that transition over to that customer success team and that account manager team as well. And then by the end of that, I mean you'll be fully up and running ready to go, but you'll still have access to the BI university.\nCoach & Share\nARCHIE\n46:54 \nIt's really important that you keep access to that. So you can access that as and when you do that as well. What I haven't mentioned as well as you get access to our Docebo community as.\nANDREA\n47:06 \nWell.\nARCHIE\n47:06 \nSo to the community is it's a great place for customers to interact. We have a very live customer community. So our customers sharing success stories frequently ask questions as well. So that's just a way to get customers engaging with each other and sharing success stories, etcetera, which we've found a massive success over the past year or so. So. I'll share… this document with you after the call when I send over the final proposal as well, if that would enter?\nWrap-Up\nJAN\n47:40 \nTrust I.\nSAMUEL\n47:42 \nIs this?\nJAN\n47:43 \nThank you.\nSAMUEL\n47:44 \nGood. Is this?\nJAN\n47:46 \nOkay with you, Kent and Ben also, is that what you also would expect?\nBEN\n47:52 \nYeah, I mean, that sounds great to be fair, especially the community aspect as well.\nARCHIE\n48:00 \nAbsolutely. Yeah. The.\nED\n48:02 \nThis is great for when you've got since this new L and D persons that will be starting there's so so much content on there.\nCoach & Share\nED\n48:11 \nSo both the do created content so they can get stuck into that. And then also the community itself. So where customers share, I mean, this will be great for everyone that the new starter, but we've got, you know, a couple of years worth of customers just sharing best practice, what works well in the platform.\nOnboarding\nED\n48:29 \nSo there's loads of information provided both from us and from our customer base. So, yeah, it's a great resource to leverage as well.\nED\n48:43 \nPerfect.\nARCHIE\n48:44 \nAny, any more questions? I know we've got another 11 minutes. So, yeah.\nPERNILLE\n48:48 \nHappy to, happy.\nARCHIE\n48:49 \nTo answer any more questions that you have.\nPERNILLE\n48:52 \nI think that what we need to cover is more internal also regarding responsibilities from between, ITHR, Ben and so on. So, so division of responsibilities. But that's an internal one that you can support us.\nARCHIE\n49:07 \nFor sure for sure. And we're always on the kickoff call as well. We've got documents that we can show you who we, who may be, is responsible for what, and how many hours each team are responsible for. I think that's a really useful document as well just to aid that conversation.\nOnboarding ends\nARCHIE\n49:24 \nSo I'll see if I can get my hands on it and I'll send that over just to aid those conversations on your side.\nJAN\n49:28 \nYeah, that would be good. Then we can try out that discussion a little bit.\nARCHIE\n49:32 \nExactly, exactly. Hopefully make it a little bit easier for.\nJAN\n49:36 \nAll right.\nWrap-Up\nARCHIE\n49:37 \nFantastic. Brilliant. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate all of you taking the time to speak with us today. Really looking forward to the next steps for the kickoff call, getting you on board as a customer. And, yeah, as always, Ben got my number. Feel free to share that around. Always sort of, yeah, willing for, to take a call if you've got any questions or answer? I.\nBEN\n50:01 \nBrilliant.

{"prompt":"SHAHIRA\n0:59 \nHi, hi… Ryan and I have been doing some digging into the groups versus Branches and I think what we discovered is one branch like per user, but I can be in multiple groups that was the takeaway.\nBranches & Groups\nANNA\n1:14 \nYes, thank you. Yeah. So in short, without a seven minute video, it's basically like I say, it's like the 10 diagram. I think that was me at the end doing this like basically, you can have people that belong to groups that are somewhat exclusive. You could think basically groups allow you technically. So Branches would be the distinguisher groups, allow you to have that dynamic grouping that would unite possibly users from different Branches. So if you think about like… maybe you're grouping everyone that's completed a certification, right? They might belong to different customer groups. Maybe those are divided by Branches. But because they've all completed a certification, now, they're a part of a group or like an onboarding class or managers like that's a great way of kind of grouping those that need to live segmented for other reasons into a way that's united.\nSHAHIRA\n2:09 \nYeah, just have to think about how we want to organize it. But yeah, I agree. It makes sense.\nOnboarding\nANNA\n2:14 \nAwesome. All right. Well, Steph is my go to wonderful Professional services representation. I know I mentioned to you yesterday, I am starting to have some more serious conversations about like, wow, I think ThreatLocker might be moving forward with Docebo and they're on a tight time line. So let's think realistically about what that means. So first of all, let me just confirm that. I always hate assuming anything but I'm receiving like red lines back. Have we made a decision to move forward at this point? Is that the plan?\nSHAHIRA\n2:47 \nSo, it's once we have the like final documentation and everything because we have our contracts manager looking at it. And then on Monday, Ryan and I are giving everything to the CEO like these are the contracts terms. These are the potential risks. These are the reason, but the decision is, yes, we want to move. The final decision of, yes, we are moving is Monday.\nANNA\n3:09 \nOkay. Okay. And I guess for clarity, have we landed on Docebo at this point?\nOnboarding ends\nSHAHIRA\n3:16 \nThat is, yes. Yeah.\nANNA\n3:19 \nAgain, I hate to be assumptive, but that is sorta what I was picking up on. So that's good.\nSHAHIRA\n3:25 \nThat's good.\nANNA\n3:28 \nOkay. So this is helpful, you know, regardless if we get full green lights or not just to be as prept as possible to receive you.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n3:37 \nThe idea is full green light. It is just a matter of keeping all of the important people in the Loop sharp and the final say, but, yeah.\nANNA\n3:46 \nOkay. So, yes. So on that note, Learnupon, is likely giving you through April fifteenth.\nSHAHIRA\n3:57 \nHopefully, so we've gotten… this wishy washy of, yeah, we should be able to do that, but no, confirmed like we've got that from our rep, but he hasn't gotten us the confirmation from his director, who would give us the final say.\nOnboarding ends\nANNA\n4:15 \nGot it. Okay. Silly reps. I'm just like come on, you can never get them to move as fast as we need that, because that would help, right?\nSHAHIRA\n4:25 \nWell, I have the director's email, so it's like one of those things like Ryan and I discussed it this morning of when should we reach out to her? And I said, well, I'm gonna give him like a full 24 hours to respond to us because maybe he did send her an email and he's waiting to hear back from her. But if I don't get a response within the 24 hours of when I sent that email yesterday afternoon, then I will send out another email.\nANNA\n4:45 \nOkay. You're on top of it, I'm not surprised.\nRYAN\n4:48 \nI think our plan is to operate as though March fifteenth is our deadline and we will hopefully have everything we need over and that gives us a month to clean up on the back end but I think Shahira and I intend to move as though March fifteenth is the deadline. Okay? No, it's tight. It's incredibly tight we are… getting prepared.\nOnboarding\nANNA\n5:17 \nSo first, I know one of the suggestions I said is like we have Professional services offerings that can help… as, you know, our full onboarding program is 16 weeks now. Even if this were a normal project and stuff, I'll let you chimein here. But like even normal might still look like some kind of MVP within that time frame and a soft launch. And, you know, even within 16… there's migration which I suggested kind of not knowing exactly what your content looks like and Learnupon that can really help teams dedicate time to other things while we're kind of worrying about uploading things for them. But it sounds like it is just truly text alone.\nOnboarding ends\nANNA\n6:01 \nI just wanted to align on that. Is it in like a doc, a PDF or anything or could you get it into that?\nSHAHIRA\n6:09 \nIt's something that could be moved that way, but it's not.\nANNA\n6:13 \nOkay. So.\nRYAN\n6:14 \nIt's not currently in docs, but we have set aside time and energy from other team members to move it out of the environment of Learnupon into docs in ways that are organized by our modules because that's how we're pulling it. And then we would have to reorganize that into our courses in order to get that moved into Docebo. From what I can see, I don't love that the doc is just uploaded and they would have to open every single piece because currently, when they open the module, they see the content not just a document for download but it does at least keep it organized in place.\nMobile App\nANNA\n6:55 \nYeah. Do you all use Google drive by chance?\nRYAN\n7:01 \nNo, we are purely Microsoft.\nANNA\n7:04 \nYeah. Okay. I was just thinking because that can just be handy as well. But that works and maybe there's something about like when you click upload as file, it becomes a download. There's another option.\nMobile App ends\nANNA\n7:16 \nIt would be the slide converter. Okay? Sounds a little counterintuitive because you think slide, it doesn't have to just be slide. That would basically allow like a PDF itself to sit within the course rather than prompt a download. So you could view the PDF in that way.\nRYAN\n7:31 \nSo, if we had it saved as a PDF doc, that would save the problem, but I know our intention is to move it all into scorm anyway, but.\nSHAHIRA\n7:41 \nWe want it in docs, so we can move it to scorm.\nRYAN\n7:44 \nRight. But we could take our doc and download as a PDF and upload the PDF into.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They are going to be moving forward, but they need confirmation from their contracts manager and CEO.  \n• ThreatLocker is in the process of making a decision to move forward with Docebo by Monday, while also confirming their choice on Docebo as their platform. \n• The team has set aside time and energy to move content out of Learnupon into documents organized by modules so they can be moved into Docebo more efficiently; however, currently it is not saved as documents yet. \n• Learnupon is giving them until April 15th, but that hasn't been officially confirmed yet. \n• They are presenting the terms to the CEO on Monday. \n END"}
{"prompt":"STEPHANIE\n13:58 \nGetting all of the information or there's errors in the information, right? For our team to actually get it up into Docebo. It's a fairly quick process to be honest. So, yeah, if you start the process now, you'll be ahead of the game.\nSHAHIRA\n14:17 \nYeah. I think as far as because we have reports for, you know, courses, enrollments, things like that, that's simple. And I know you guys have a particular format you want it in. But like I can see this easily being done early next week versus it's the training materials that's gonna take a little more time. But I think the most important aspects that Ryan and I really want to take away and utilize the migration service for is the core shells and the learner history like that's super important to us.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n14:49 \nAnd so, ideally it's so it's a seven week process including generally seven weeks including the time it takes for customers to input the data or is it seven weeks after the data is received?\nSTEPHANIE\n15:02 \nYeah, it includes everything. So that's your kickoff call to ensure alignment, review, what the scoping document is, confirm all of the items that you are having added into Docebo and then starting the process so that's you're giving us your data and then working through any errors, communication of that and then getting it up and loaded into Docebo.\nOnboarding ends\nSHAHIRA\n15:28 \nAnd is it something that the process could be in that we give you this data first, this data gets started and then this data as we get it gets put in or is it until everything is complete then you guys start?\nSTEPHANIE\n15:43 \nNo, no, we could do it as a kind of a phased approach if you wanna do to the first two as your priority and then have the training materials follow. That's completely fine.\nSHAHIRA\n15:54 \nOkay. That's good to know. Yeah. Okay. Am I okay to stop screen share? Yeah, everyone.\nANNA\n16:01 \nSuper helpful. And then what I'll say is, of course, send that my way. And then I'll send it to teams to get official pricing on that stuff's. Totally accurate. I'm looking at that and that looks on the very low end of our migration. So that should be good. I was laughing cause step earlier when we were chatting was like, I mean can they sign today? And so like naturally, you feel the urgency, we feel the urgency together, right?\nSHAHIRA\n16:29 \nYeah.\nANNA\n16:30 \nMy logistical question is, okay, you're not getting final goes until Monday anyway, but would the team be prepared to be able to sign it? Do it like as early as Monday if?\nSHAHIRA\n16:42 \nThe idea is that we're presenting all of the information and he signs the document right there in our meeting that's the idea that's why we have the contracts manager gone. We sent him all the things you sent us yesterday. We sent him and he received your word, doc today and he's gone through everything and he has of course, made some red line like a few suggestions. So that will be for your team to review. And then he's making a risk assessment type of a risk list for us to go over with our CEO on Monday. And then it's just gonna be like, hey, we've talked about this. You've already okayed this idea. So here are the details for you to actually look at. And then he'll look at the details and it is Ryan and I assume it's going to be a very simple like, okay, that's fine. And then get the signature and move forward. Okay? We assume, so we hope.\nANNA\n17:35 \nThat's good. Thanks for walking me through that because what that means is I can assuming my team can look at it and give, okay and whatever on those suggestions today, I can go ahead and get that ready and DocuSign for your CEO for Monday if that's the plan that right after that meeting, he can just pull up his email and go great. Done. I just don't wanna cause any delays here. If we're talking about something this type.\nSHAHIRA\n18:00 \nYeah. Our meetings at noon on Monday, it's set in his calendar and our calendars. So that's what our time frame is looking at. Our contacts. Guy knows our time frame. So he's making sure that everything is ready for Ryan and I to walk into that meeting and walk out and be able to hit the ground running.\nOnboarding\nANNA\n18:17 \nOkay. Awesome. Now, I did want to just align on Professional services at large so we can talk through more of kind of what the onboarding you're definitely getting entails but also it's worth being aware of additional offerings we have like even for partnership purposes, right? You're going to be a customer for three years, what exists as a resource? And then maybe more specifically if we need to explore this and there's the it to pay for additional services that could be quite impactful, I think to get you rolling fast as well. So I say this because I've had teams go as crazy as like outsourcing onboarding entirely. And someone stood up their platform in two weeks for them right there's all kinds of interesting things we're accustomed to doing to meet clients where they are and support them. And I just thought step is a wealth of knowledge to be able to highlight what some of those are.\nOnboarding ends\nANNA\n19:12 \nAnd then of course, you can kind of understand is that even something we want, we need, we can pay for et cetera.\nRYAN\n19:19 \nOkay.\nSTEPHANIE\n19:21 \nYeah. And I mean, one of the questions that I really like to ask you're in a unique scenario here. So what worries you most about taking a project on like this?\nRYAN\n19:32 \nI know for me, it's that our customer facing portal or group, what branch however it's termed will not look up to the standard that we expect it to. And the reason that we're choosing Docebo by the day we go live, which can't be later than March fifteenth at this point. So I want to be able to present a better product than we're currently leaving.\nANNA\n19:57 \nOkay. Nitty gritty question. Sorry, staff. We are Adam in about no laps in academy as well, right? Like some teams are kinda like, you know, it's okay if this isn't live and customer facing for two weeks or even for a month, right? But we want it available the day that you leave Learnupon.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The day they go live can't be later than March 15th. \n• The contracts manager is sending over red lines to review. \n• They hope they will get a sigature in their Monday meeting. \n• The meeting is on Monday at noon. END"}
{"prompt":"SHAHIRA\n20:18 \nThere aren't I wanna say that the day that we leave Learnupon, we want some specific learning pass that we have to be live but they don't all need to be live. So there are some aspects that some nitty gritty specific, how two courses that we have available and knowledge base like they don't need that course. It'll be okay if that course isn't ready and live and good to go, which is why I say some of the content isn't necessarily like why we need it because it's available in other places. So, and our support team is phenomenal and anything that is lacking in the university, if someone doesn't know how to access it, we have a team who can support our clients to be able to get that information out there as they need it. But what we don't want is for people who have like this content they've put in this time, we don't want that information to go away like that, they've like completed things or the progress towards things, you know. But Ryan is absolutely right in that we're more willing to have hiccups on the internal side versus the external side because it's very much a, we want to present ourselves in the way that we are an industry standard or we are an industry leader because we are, and we want to present ourselves that way. So it's important to us that what we show is organized is a step up into why we're dealing with this migration to begin with, right? That we have specific content available like our overall certification content, right? Because we have our own certification courses. And so that stuff is important.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n21:57 \nBut as far as like these nitty gritty how to like some of those content things. And Ryan and I can identify those too within like our upload, spreadsheets, we can, however we decide with the team to like best like, you know, phase it out then that we can totally help with that, do that.\nOnboarding ends\nSHAHIRA\n22:14 \nBut I think that's like the main things if I think like the basics for the external would be our certification, keep the certification stuff, keep the monetizing stuff for the MSP and on the internal side, keep the employee handbook stuff handy for, you know, the new hire, some of our basic onboarding past.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n22:33 \nBut again, some of the nitty gritty things that aren't assigned to like these onboarding things, some of the extra ongoing learning stuff can be pushed off.\nRYAN\n22:43 \nYeah, let's keep all the hiccups on the employees side, not the vendor side or not vendors and clients.\nSTEPHANIE\n22:52 \nOkay. So ideally you shut down Learnupon and do was available?\nSHAHIRA\n22:58 \nThat's ideally. Well, I wouldn't say that's ideally, that's what we want to prepare for, but ideally, there will be an extra month that we're given… we're hoping that we're going to have the extra.\nSTEPHANIE\n23:11 \nYeah. Yeah. Okay. And is it just the two of you as part of the project team for onboarding?\nOnboarding ends\nSTEPHANIE\n23:21 \nOr do you have other team members that are not on the call today to support you through something like this?\nSHAHIRA\n23:27 \nSo you as pulling content? Sorry, Ryan?\nRYAN\n23:30 \nI was gonna say go ahead that's fine.\nSHAHIRA\n23:33 \nPulling content. We have support. Great. So that part is we'll have other team members like Ryan mentioned earlier, like actively going into Learnupon, copying, pasting, pulling into doc files, things like that, as far as all the upload stuff currently that's planned for me and Ryan.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n23:50 \nBut if we find the need to pull people for support in that aspect too, I think it's a matter of us asking and then dealt gating, and I think that the executive team has been very supportive of us so far. So, I think if we identify that there is this need that we would get some fashion of support depending on what we say.\nSTEPHANIE\n24:11 \nOkay. And then in terms of configuration and testing through the onboarding process and really building out your solution within Docebo, is it just the two of you or will there be additional hands on support?\nRYAN\n24:26 \nIt's gonna be us, there, there may be plans for a third person at this point, but I don't know that we're aware of them.\nNext Steps\nSTEPHANIE\n24:33 \nOkay. But we are the team. Okay? And how much time in the next four weeks, will you be able to dedicate to a project like this?\nSHAHIRA\n24:48 \nI would say… there, maybe I would say we would have at least half of every day at least, but as Ryan says, it's like all of it, it's like, yeah, a lot of time is going to be dedicated to this migration, but I would say at least four hours of every Workday.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n25:08 \nOkay. Okay. So sometimes, you know, as Anna had mentioned, our standard onboarding project is 16 weeks. We take a train the trainer approach. It's an iterative, you know, you are learning, you're being guided, you're being taught, your hands are on the keyboard, doing the configuration, you will be guided with best practices from a do table expert. Along the way, you still have email communication with this tight and shorten time frame. We sometimes see two calls a week, three calls a week with your solution deployment manager. Other, you know, we can extend your team for you so we can provide you with a Docebo expert to provide the hands on keyboard that has the knowledge. So that really supports an accelerated time frame like this because you can dedicate maybe together eight hours a week, which is great. But what if you were able to put in another four hours, six hours, you know, that sort of thing to alleviate some of that off of you and know that you can meet that time frame so that's something that we can do where we can provide you with a dedicated LMS administrator… that may be, you know, helpful for you.\nOnboarding ends\nSTEPHANIE\n26:34 \nI understand we totally respect budget but I'm here to provide you with options, you know, so wanna make sure that you are educated on what's available to you and it may not be today, but even to consider down the road, right?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The content that needs to be live is mainly certification courses, monetizing strategies for MSPs, employee handbooks and basic onboarding materials. \n• They don't want their content to go away when migrating. \n• They're more willing to have hiccups on the internal side versus the external side because it's very much a matter of presenting themselves as an industry standard or an industry leader. \n• The day they leave learn upon, they want specific learning passes that they have to be live, but some nitty gritty content isn't necessary. END"}
{"prompt":"STEPHANIE\n26:51 \nSo with external being the priority, let's say you could accept a delay or a gap in the internal is what I'm understanding… what is most important beyond certifications for that external experience, you know, we speak to minimal viable product MVP. What would that be? What would you consider an MVP for your external Audience?\nPayment Gateway ends\nSHAHIRA\n27:24 \nYou know, I think our product right now is kind of very basic in its presentations. So to be honest, it wouldn't take too much in my opinion. Ryan, do you wanna put in your two cents here?\nRYAN\n27:38 \nYeah. Not only do we need to have the material available on the external side, but getting over those users, making sure they're in a grouping that makes sense to their organizations, having the managers identified and still able to see their users inside their own groups.\nUser Permission\nRYAN\n27:58 \nThe way that we've had before, I know you guys provide the, you can upload who's a manager, but like we can identify Power users, but we can't necessarily… change their settings through an import or a CSV file. Like, so we're going to have to go through and touch every one of those Power users once they're uploaded and make sure they've got the right people in their groups. I just want to give a really complete and seamless transition to our external users. And luckily, there are not as many of them logging in every day, although there are more of them, they use the university side less than our internal side does.\nSHAHIRA\n28:45 \nAlso, the way we currently have it set up like for example, we have two people who would be Power users while they're Power users over 17 different groups. And we're only going to be able to import them under one group and then have to add in the rest. And they're the extreme case. But we have other users who are managers or Power users over multiple groups. So it's like one of those things that's gonna take like man Power, not just an import to actually make sure.\nUser Permission ends\nRYAN\n29:11 \nAbout 40 people who are managers on more than one group. And so again, it, those are just things that we have to, you know, list as needed to be done. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to touch every part of our program and say, what do we need to do? And where does this fall in a priority? That way? We just start working down the list as soon as we have access to the pro.\nSTEPHANIE\n29:34 \nYeah. Understood. How are users getting into the system? So internal generally HRIS, what about external, how's that information getting into your MS?\nSHAHIRA\n29:51 \nSo, it's kind of two different ways either they are directly invited by their group manager by email link, right?\nNotifications\nSHAHIRA\n29:59 \nOr it, we do also have the open enrollment feature for anyone who just happens to Google it or click on the enroll from our knowledge base article or something like that. So they are able to enroll two separate ways.\nSTEPHANIE\n30:15 \nOkay.\nANNA\n30:15 \nLike Power users registration on behalf of… sorry, go ahead.\nSTEPHANIE\n30:24 \nNo, it's fine.\nRYAN\n30:25 \nAsk do as part of the onboarding, are we going to be able to mass email our users and offer them a way to log in and set up their account? Once we've added their email in? Yeah, yeah. Okay.\nSTEPHANIE\n30:40 \nYeah. So Notifications auto, enrollments that's all part of it.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n30:45 \nAnd what I can do to this may be helpful just to prepare you a bit. I can prepare or I can send over via our task list. So you will have access to our project management tool. We ask that one of you is we refer to it as the hives. So we ask that one of you is the clean bee and then they're tasking out accordingly to the worker bees. You know, it is gonna need to get involved. So to set up different pieces, it's not a big task list for it, but they do need to be aware that they are involved. So on this task list, it outlines the week generally speaking of when they're needed, how much time is needed, understand too that it is a project plan, but it doesn't need to go in sequential order. So it's all dependent on what your priorities are and what you're trying to accomplish.\nLayout & Content\nSTEPHANIE\n31:40 \nSo it kind of can act as a bouncing ball in a way. And it may be helpful for you just to evaluate that ahead of time so that you guys are prepared to. So I'm happy to share that information for you. One thing that I also like to note that people don't take into consideration is marketing generally wants to be involved or at least if you have access to a style guide just from a branding perspective, design perspective, especially if there's customer facing, so.\nLayout & Content ends\nSHAHIRA\n32:09 \nYeah, we have spoken to marketing. We have the branding guide and we have been told to send over the specifications and they'll start working on some images for us.\nSTEPHANIE\n32:19 \nAwesome. Okay, great. You guys here on?\nANNA\n32:23 \nRight, totally.\nSTEPHANIE\n32:25 \nTrying.\nRYAN\n32:26 \nWe're not gonna miss a beat on this, I.\nSTEPHANIE\n32:28 \nCan tell, I can tell this is awesome. Yeah, right.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n32:32 \nYour project management background is gonna shine here.\nSTEPHANIE\n32:35 \nReady to go.\nANNA\n32:37 \nThat's good. Yeah, I will say like the willingness to dedicate as much time as possible is key, you know, like I always say, like we go as fast as our clients can go. We're not going to hold you back but see clients that meet with their solution deployment manager the next week and they haven't even logged into the system.\nNext Steps\nANNA\n32:57 \nIt's like, well is a week, you know? So if you're really going to spend, I know 20 hours a week between each one of you. So 40 hours a week doing this for four weeks, I think that helps.\nRYAN\n33:11 \nYeah. And we've got a team of people that have been told that the deadline is February 20 eighth to off board all of our info. So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They have a team of people that have been told that the deadline is February 28th to off board all of their info.\n• They have spoken to marketing and they will be sending over the specifications. \n END"}
{"prompt":"STEPHANIE\n33:20 \nOne thing to note. So previous to this role, I was an account manager at Docebo. I've managed multiple clients at Docebo. I've had scenarios where a client had completed their solution before our kickoff call had happened. So as soon as the contract is signed, you do have access to your platform. You know, we can share the resources that you'll have access to throughout the partnership as well. So there is nothing stopping you if you guys are Gong how there is nothing stopping you from, you know, diving in, starting on a few different things that you feel comfortable with before solution appointment manager is assigned to you and the project kicks off. So I just like…\nSHAHIRA\n34:04 \nToday, Ryan has been clicking around from the log INS that Anna has been provided us and I've signed up for the university to start going through there. So we've both taken like a divide and conquer approach to how are we gonna learn this type of stuff and how we're going to get moving?\nOnboarding ends\nSTEPHANIE\n34:21 \nYeah. Awesome. An important course. If you don't have access to it, maybe we can jump start access and we could look into it, but do have already is of course that we ask you to take before onboarding, so we can try and see if we can get you early access if you can access it today.\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n34:40 \nYep. Let me see. I'll try and pull it up while we're talking.\nANNA\n34:44 \nAnother thing in that course and I can send it if you can't get it, but we have a use case document and that's also, I think going to be helpful in your pre planning. And then even for us, the sooner that we can get things like that, the sooner that we can have the nitty gritty details about what is an MVP to you. All the info you've provided today is helpful, but this kinda takes it a step further and to get it in writing from you directly is pretty helpful for us. So maybe take some time and work through some of that as well.\nSHAHIRA\n35:14 \nOkay. Did you say it was Docebo ready? Okay?\nOnboarding ends\nSTEPHANIE\n35:19 \nCan you enroll in it?\nSHAHIRA\n35:20 \nYes.\nANNA\n35:22 \nPerfect. I'll ask you another detailed question. Your installation name. We have technically within our URL on our side just to get you a system dot. Com. You likely saw that on the trial that's kind of like part of the installation, you can always rebrand it. That be another step, maybe phase two, I don't know, but that's like a vanity URL where your marketing team could absolutely just name it ThreatLocker dot com or whatever ThreatLocker university, dotcom. But on our side, we need something just to get going. I would recommend something simple with that in mind because you can always change that custom vanity URL.\nSHAHIRA\n36:06 \nCurrently, the client side is ThreatLocker Learnupon, dot. Com. So like, you know, you saying that you guys have that piece in there, it's just if we're keeping it consistent ThreatLocker, that dotcom.\nANNA\n36:20 \nThat's perfect. And as step said as soon as we would have an agreement signed, I would get you in there right away and I can even be a resource in between you getting an assignment from our team, just if you go ahead and get in there and add logos and all that stuff. If you have questions I'm used to answer in a lot of those… okay?\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n36:52 \nWe got this.\nSHAHIRA\n36:53 \nWe'll look out for the task list.\nSTEPHANIE\n36:57 \nYes.\nRYAN\n36:58 \nThe use case document and the access to your project management tool?\nSTEPHANIE\n37:04 \nYeah, we…\nRYAN\n37:06 \nFor both of those and we… we've been planning a lot. We've got a lot of time in the next month to devote to this. We're gonna make it work.\nSHAHIRA\n37:18 \nWork and Ryan and I are dedicated to the cost.\nANNA\n37:21 \nYeah, I love it.\nSTEPHANIE\n37:23 \nJust know if you get to a point that you are both pulling out your hair, you're not sleeping at night and you need help, we have it.\nSHAHIRA\n37:34 \nOkay. I do wanna take a second to like just talk about what general assistance we can expect with the standard like gold onboarding that is included.\nNext Steps\nSTEPHANIE\n37:46 \nSo generally speaking, it's one call a week and you set those up right at the beginning. So I know we're over time, but do you guys have a couple of minutes so that I can kind of bring up what the stages look like? So we can talk to them a little bit?\nOnboarding\nSHAHIRA\n38:02 \nI have time if you have time.\nSTEPHANIE\n38:03 \nYeah, I do.\nSHAHIRA\n38:06 \nWe appreciate this because this is gonna help us like wrap our heads around like, okay, this is what we can expect and if we really want to take advantage of the extra services we could purchase to help us get things moving.\nSTEPHANIE\n38:18 \nYep. So these are our phases that get worked through. So you're in the evaluation stage right now, we're in that first phase, we talk about Docebo already, so you can complete that. And once a contract is signed, then we work to have you meet your account manager. We wait for your solution deployment manager to be assigned, and then we move into a kickoff call. So this is where you're going to bring your entire team. Generally speaking, we recommend that anyone that's going to be involved in the overall project is brought on that call so that we're aligned and we'll do the same on the Docebo side, we confirm your business objectives and this is where the information gets put into the project plan that I mentioned to have and you work through that. So you're gonna meet those key milestones, your timelines, and just to ensure that you're aligned on those, on all those pieces. So configuration validation, this is the meat and potatoes. This is where you're going to spend most of your time. And this is generally done through one weekly call. But based on your time line, you may agree to two calls a week, that sorta thing. But that's definitely something that you can establish with your solution to plan deployment manager right up at the forefront.\nSHAHIRA\n39:41 \nOkay. And if it's something that we do decide on like two calls per week instead of the one that's not an additional cost.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Stephanie and Shahira discussed the onboarding process for Docebo, including access to resources once a contract is signed. \n• Anna suggested completing a use case document as part of their pre-planning. \n• Shahira asked about what assistance they will get with onboarding. \n• Shahira signed up for the university to start going through there.\n END"}
{"prompt":"CLEMENT\n1:04 \nSorry. Ready. So, yeah. Okay. I hope it gets resolved soon. I wanted to talk to you guys today because we were looking at different sort of like workflows. Actually, we had several workflows that we wanted to like explore. And as you know, like our systems are our current like L and D processes and systems are needlessly convoluted and complicated. I should say… I would like to share… our current process. Our current process as you can see here is outlined at the top. A lot of this is very onerous and it involves a lot of manual work. So we had some questions in terms of it's more like a feasibility check in terms of like we, we're doing this with all the vendors right now to check to confirm whether or not it's possible to actually carry out this kind of like automated workflow.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n2:09 \nSo right now, the way we do it like manually is for something like classroom training. First of what we do is we enter all our training dates into a Sharepoint file. It's actually a shared excel. And then once we enter all the training dates, we log in to SAP and we input all the training dates into SAP and we create the classes, the sessions, et cetera. And we generate the registration link so that people can like click on the links and sign up. And then because this is an internal calendar that we have like in Sharepoint, we don't share it with like the wider organization. So we publish like the dates on like our quarterly calendar.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nCLEMENT\n2:57 \nOur quarterly calendar is hosted on a CMS where we basically, we have customized the page to include all the links to all these training courses with tiles that are basically corresponding to these courses that people can easily click on. So they don't have to do it within SAP because if they went into SAP, it would be probably about 10 clicks.\nNotifications\nCLEMENT\n3:24 \nAnd usually we send the deep links from SAP to them via email or we do it through the calendar here that we're using. So what happens next after that is we announce we send out email blasts. We announce on yammer that we have updated our quarterly calendar with all the required dates etcetera.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n3:45 \nAnd then the dates are linked. So we just wait for them to register. And when they register it's updated on SAP because it's a deep link. So what happens after that is we prepare for like the class there's like a pre class like preparation. So we find out like who? Has actually enrolled in the class via the LMS. And basically, it's all manual. So we'll have like a sign up sheet that's in the classroom where people just sign and mark their names. And then we do like this post everything we have like a kind of after the class is ended, the Instructor will go on SAP and basically mark the attendance for all those concerned what attend the class essentially.\nCertifications\nCLEMENT\n4:36 \nAnd usually they do it like batch by batch because… it's they don't it's not usually a common, I mean, it's because it's so troublesome. They don't do it like immediately after the class, they may say like, okay, like let's input all the training, like maybe like for example, our head will say like, can you like put all the training dates and update all the training dates for the month of November?\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n4:59 \nAnd then we'll have like a meeting to talk about up like the data and like the completion rates, et cetera. And like who's the attendance rates and like review. So it's kind of like done a synchronously that's what I would say is happening here whereby we kind of enter the dates on SAP. We communicate it in a separate system. People attend the session. We manually record their attendance. And when the session is over, we basically enter the data into the system and make it part of the record. So it's kind of broken and fragmented as you can see here. And if there is any follow up that's required, there is no continuity in terms of going from one. For example, like if we need to follow up after like a selling skills like workshop, there's no sort of like mechanism within where we can like say, like this is a follow up session to that earlier session with this batch because there's no continuity built within it. So it's just kind of we schedule a new session, but we inform them manually offline like through email.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nCLEMENT\n6:11 \nSo within the system itself, we don't have that continuity here. So this is kind of a snapshot of like what classroom training is like at the moment in terms of the business process internally. So we don't know like how, whether this is possible, like we have checked, were checking with vendors on this one.\nUser Permission\nCLEMENT\n6:31 \nThe second part here, which is if we have super admins and you have like instructors Power users and end users. Can you do something like this where for example, you log into administrator and you create the course essentially and then you're able to update the L and D calendar.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n6:51 \nWe don't know like, okay. So there are two things one is our outlook calendar. The second thing is we need to have like a kind of like shared calendar internally with an land that not the whole organization can see. We need to have our own like training calendar so to speak. But then we also need to have like another calendar which everyone can see for sign ups. So I think we need to distinguish between these two types of account, an internal calendar and an external calendar. So the Instructor should be able to see our whenever a training event is created. Like what you see here setting up the learning activity in the LMS, the Instructor should be, should have like their event updated in their outlook calendar or to be able to see the event that's going to happen and they'll be notified about it. And likewise for end users, this is the end user column that our end user role. They should be able to see their outlook calendar being updated with the event that they were enrolled into. So what would happen next is if that were at all possible, is that after the event has been created in the LMS, and after the calendar has been synchronized, there should be like some kind of automated way to send an announcement or notification to like the attendees, and also to the Instructor to let them, let the Instructor know that they are going to be in this training, and also the Instructor to get the attendance list. Because right now our attendance list, you see up here, it's printed. It's actually printed before in the class prep before we go inside and start the class. Like the Instructor will receive a paper copy of the attendance sheet so that he or she knows like who's going to be in the class with other details, which department, and also like their other like information. So in which role, et cetera. So that's basically the public comps part the Instructor needs to know. And then the end user to receive the notification that they have been enrolled to the course. So they have that visibility. And then for the pre class prep, maybe right now, what we do with the pre classes, we have to check maybe like one or two weeks before the class.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Clement discussed the current process for classroom training, which involves entering dates into a shared Excel file and generating registration links.\n• The quarterly calendar is hosted on a CMS with tiles linking to each course. Email blasts are sent out when the calendar is updated. \n• After registering, there's manual preparation for classes including sign-up sheets in classrooms and attendance recording after class ends in SAP. \n• Clement then looked at user permissions, discussing whether it would be possible to have an internal/external calendar that could update Outlook calendars of instructors/end users and send notifications when events are created or courses enrolled in by end users. END"}
{"prompt":"CLEMENT\n9:17 \nLike what are the enrollment rates? We have to go inside the system actively to find out what the enrollment percentage or the enrollment number of seats that have been occupied out of like the total seats. So we have to investigate this manually when we go inside the system itself.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n9:33 \nSo we wanna take that kind of like uncertainty out because we can't be going to the system and like checking repeatedly daily, hourly, like to make sure or to make sure that we have like enough attendance before we start the class because, you know, like we don't have enough people attending the class, we might just cancel it or if we have reached maximum capacity, we should be notified as well too.\nNotifications\nCLEMENT\n9:56 \nSo if there is a way after this period in which the like communications have been sent out after the calendar has been updated again, let me just recap learning activity created calendar updated for end users and for instructors, and for L and D, public communication sent to instructors and L and D. I'm sorry, public communications sent out to instructors and end users. Sorry, my bad here. Yeah, public communication is sent to end users and instructors, and then for the pre class prep for weekly reports about enrollment or maybe enrollment Notifications about like what's the total enrollment? Like at like fixed periods or fixed dates so that we don't have to keep going and check this.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n10:42 \nSo, and so has just enroll to this. So we've got, we got six people instead of five people in them. So that's something we want to take the manual aspect out of. And then when the class runs, maybe we can do something like… the QR code for the attendance as well too. And then after that, we can have like an attendance report, feedback report, like on a survey. Like maybe the attendance QR code can also include like a survey at the very end. Maybe they actually scan the QR core for attendance at the end of the class and not at the beginning so that they can do the survey together with the attendance marking. And then we have like a sort of like attendance report and like a survey report like for each class, and that's viewable by the Instructor. And then if needed, we can have that continuity to schedule up a follow up session. But with the, with the sort of like history and continuity building from this current session. So that we don't have to say we're creating an entirely new session that in, from a system perspective, it's disconnected from the previous one. We're just building another session with the same Cohort. But then we can't recognize it within the system that is the same sort of like thing and it's a follow up.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nCLEMENT\n12:07 \nSo we don't want that to happen. So we don't know if that's possible as well too to be able to have that continuity that this is all part of like if say, for example, we want the Instructor to like check on the status of like maybe it's like an assessment and they don't do well.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n12:27 \nAnd then like a post like workshop assessment, a schedule, a follow up session is needed. So we schedule a follow up session and then a follow up session can be traced back to that first session with like the assessment for example, and then you can continue to build that continuity.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nCLEMENT\n12:43 \nSo you have that historical like data for that Cohort. So that's kind of like what we're thinking, what we're wondering if it's possible actually. So what do you think?\nMALLORY\n12:58 \nThat's a lot?\nCLEMENT\n13:00 \nYeah. Let me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Clement discussed the need to find a way to take out manual checking of enrollment rates and be notified when maximum capacity is reached.\n• Clement proposed public communications sent out, pre-class prep for weekly reports about enrollment, and QR codes for attendance with surveys at the end. \n• Clement also suggested having continuity in scheduling follow up sessions that can trace back to first session assessments. END"}
{"prompt":"CLEMENT\n16:50 \nJust make it read only for like the end user that's what you're that's adjusting, right? Okay.\nMALLORY\n16:56 \nThey would see it. They wouldn't be enrolled to it. They could just see the calendar.\nCLEMENT\n17:01 \nGot it.\nMALLORY\n17:04 \nIt's just to centralize the process.\nCLEMENT\n17:08 \nAnd I think that.\nMALLORY\n17:09 \nThink.\nCLEMENT\n17:11 \nThat does make sense. That actually brings me into my two questions actually… so okay, actually, let me just kind of like backtrack a bit like it is better to have everything centralized in a single place. I think what I'm about to like ask you is more of like a kind of like change management like question. Maybe it's something you can like answer like how previous clients have done it. We've asked similar questions to other ones as well too, which is right now, I think in a survey that we conducted recently with like people about like our current LMS, I think having it centralized is actually great because that has been one of the greatest complaints about things being scattered. But one thing I've been like kind of like we've been wrangling about is accessibility, like how do we make the LMS accessible? Like to make invisible? Because a lot of like the comments that we have received from people are along the lines of how to make it more transparent, accessible and easy to access.\nMobile App\nCLEMENT\n18:24 \nLike we're not talking about like the mobile version because the mobile version is the app for example, with many others. But in, for the desktop version, right now, the way we access it is a SAP SuccessFactors is through bookmarks, like we bookmark like the learning page and we go inside.\nMobile App ends\nCLEMENT\n18:42 \nWhereas some other people have actually never actually even seen the LMS before yet, mainly because we have been deep linking courses, but they have never gone inside the LMS and stuff they don't know about the LMS existing. They only know about the courses that we have deep linked and shared because to them, it's well, it's a very like complex and long winded URL to like copy and paste to go inside the LMS itself. So some people have bookmarked it. The ones who are much more keen on like expanding their learning, others who are much more busy maybe or don't have time to actually take time to go and look like they can't have it at their fingertips. So like they're usually we're usually resorting to those deep links that we share. So I don't know like in terms of visibility and accessibility. How have previous clients that you guys have worked with, solve this problem of making it visible across the organization? Because it's about building habits of having people the habit of using the LMS but it's also about visibility and reach. We can do a lot of change management communications to like tell people that to introduce the LMS to publicize the new LMS and to tell them that this is a new way of doing things. New way of going in. But the other component is if we're still like using the same method of like book marking the LMS and like sort of kind of like sharing urls et cetera.\nLearning Plans\nCLEMENT\n20:23 \nLike it won't be as visible. So visibility is kind of like a major sticking point in terms of building a learning culture as well too. Because the learning culture right now is probably limited to what they see physically, which is like the classroom training and the deep links to courses.\nLearning Plans ends\nCLEMENT\n20:43 \nBut if you ask the average person on the street within our company, like what the, what, where do you go to for learning? They will say just I'll just Google it. I'll just web search it or ask a colleague. They don't know about the LMS portal because it's invisible. So I don't know what your take is on that in your experience with previous comments?\nOnboarding\nMALLORY\n21:01 \nI'm conscious, we have seven minutes. I'm gonna try and answer this very briefly and potentially we might need another call because it's kind of a bigger topic I think that we need to touch on. I wanna make sure we get the technical stuff right today. I would suggest that obviously internal marketing and the initial landing of the learners when they come in is going to be really important and that be sort of their guiding to key parts of the LMS that they need going to really be able to lean into.\nOnboarding ends\nMALLORY\n21:30 \nOne of these could be this new calendar. So this is where you'll find the up to date calendar of training and have that linked directly onto their main landing, which will take them to like a calendar widget page potentially. But I think that it's kind of a bigger conversation I think we should have. And I am conscious that I have a lot of notes that I want to sort of talk about the rest of this process specifically. So if you don't mind, can we?\nCLEMENT\n21:58 \nWe can, we can address that like later. I think let's clear this first. What I'll do is let me just because I think we talked about this concept, the sorry, the unpublished cap catalog calendar and the published calendar.\nCourse Enrollment\nCLEMENT\n22:15 \nSo I'm going to just give you like a quick look at what our internal and external calendar looks like right now and.\nMALLORY\n22:24 \nCan integrate with Docebo, connect with outlook or obviously we're built on open APIs. And so that could automatically also create calendar invites into the training calendars within outlook in terms of, you know, creating the event and having it available and things like that. So it is possible just depends on the technical integration. The normal standard integration with outlook is the person that enrolls receives a calendar, ics attachment to the email. So they will be able to add that to themselves. So someone's managing that outlook calendar as in they can go in and accept an ics.\nNotifications\nMALLORY\n23:05 \nThen you could also just have them as have the shared calendar as a recipient and enrollment into those events as like a block like a just like a, an extra email address, a user within the platform and they can get added automatically if that makes sense.\nCLEMENT\n23:26 \nSo they wouldn't need to accept the ics in order for it to be visible and outlook, right? Because sometimes you don't accept it. It's still like showing up on your intern. I mean, in your outlook.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Clement and Mallory discussed the need to make their Learning Management System (LMS) more visible, accessible, and easy to access.\n• Clement suggested that deep linking courses was one way of doing this but it wasn't ideal as some people had never seen the LMS before.\n• Mallory proposed internal marketing initiatives such as a calendar widget page which would help guide learners when they first join the system.\n• They also talked about integrating with Docebo or Outlook in order for users to receive notifications regarding upcoming training events via email attachments or shared calendars respectively. END"}
{"prompt":"MALLORY\n23:35 \nSo open up the ICS and add it to your calendar that's the native out of the box if you want it to automatically create the event in outlook that's the integration piece.\nCLEMENT\n23:46 \nThe integration piece. And by that, you mean the table connect or is there?\nMALLORY\n23:52 \nConnect or via open a P is yep.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nCLEMENT\n23:55 \nWell, okay. Yeah, it's okay. So basically what the short answer to this is, we have the unpublished calendar and then we have the published external calendar. And then for the outlook, it's dependent on integration with the APIs or connect.\nMALLORY\n24:13 \nYeah, it's just a matter of if it's under published or working progress, you have sort of an under progress like working progress catalog. And then you have a calendar with just the working progress courses visible in that catalog. And then once that course has been confirmed, you would then just assign it to the correct catalog.\nCLEMENT\n24:33 \nOkay. Okay. So let's say for the public communications part, I mean, these Notifications can be done for the Instructor and the end user as well, too, right? We can.\nNotifications\nMALLORY\n24:50 \nYeah. And you can send, you can send a digest to the instructors of the enrolled users to courses.\nCLEMENT\n24:57 \nOkay. So basically like that.\nMALLORY\n25:00 \nSomeone in rolls or you can send like a digest every once a week or every three days or however often.\nCLEMENT\n25:07 \nEssentially step forward can be accomplished through that digest.\nNotifications ends\nMALLORY\n25:11 \nYeah.\nCLEMENT\n25:12 \nYeah. Okay. Over.\nMALLORY\n25:16 \nTerms of generating a attendance QR code, we have spoken about this before. However the last time we spoke about this, it was using a test for training material. But I have thought of another idea. We have a product which is data Lane impact, which that will automatically send a QR code created to the Instructor.\nCourse Enrollment\nMALLORY\n25:36 \nIt will also include an attendance sheet. And so the learners will scan the QR code. They'll complete a core survey. They will get an attendance sheet that they have to sign themselves virtually and that will automatically mark the attendance. And then obviously, the piece which is around the feedback and how they, how the, how you can use that. But that, that's a specific product. However out of the box, what you could do is create. So the Instructor creates or has the core survey as part of the session. And then they would just use that it's called a training material. So they would use that training material link as the QR code that they need to create.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nMALLORY\n26:18 \nAnd so what they'll do is they'll have that visible. The learners will scan that, complete the survey. And once they've completed the survey, that will automatically mark them as attended.\nCLEMENT\n26:29 \nOkay. Yeah, that's I mean that's the approach that you shared in the video you and Monica.\nMALLORY\n26:33 \nI use the test with the blanks, but this could be with the core survey. So if you could want that to be mandatory the core survey, then that would also mark them as attended.\nCLEMENT\n26:44 \nOkay. Noted on that. Thanks for sharing that. And what about contony with you?\nMALLORY\n26:50 \nSo you can set up sessions around… the same event. I'll have to look into this a little bit more because I haven't had that question specifically. So let me get back to you on that piece specifically around like what that continuity can look like. It's just a matter of figuring out how that would work, but I don't see that as being a big.\nCLEMENT\n27:13 \nYeah. Okay. Yeah, because, you know, like what I mean? Like especially when it comes to like for example, coaching, we have outline coaching as well too. Like a coaching is like it won't be a one off event. It will be finding out like check INS like regularly and like that continuity as well too. So it'll be interesting to see if that can be accomplished. I think the other sort of like steps, I mean, based on this first reading of like classroom training internally, it seems like the other steps probably will be doable as well too. So if we have like external training for example, by like external vendors, and then if we create like an external like training course inside the LMS itself… and then…\nCourse Enrollment\nMALLORY\n27:59 \nSame, you will create as if it were just an ILT session. And in fact, you can have the external training provider. You can give them access as a Power user to manage that session if you want.\nCLEMENT\n28:11 \nOkay.\nMALLORY\n28:15 \nIf you wanted to, you don't.\nCLEMENT\n28:16 \nIs there, is there a possibility that if we don't have like enough like users enrolled by a certain point cut off date that the Instructor can be notified to cancel the session?\nSmall Talk\nCLEMENT\n28:31 \nLike if it's like only like one week left, sorry, one day left and or not one day would be quite extreme. Yeah.\nMALLORY\n28:38 \nWe have a wait. You have, we do have waiting lists. So if there's too many people can wait for cancellations, let me check on the reverse situation.\nSmall Talk ends\nMALLORY\n28:47 \nI'm really sorry, Clement, we do have to jump to another call but you want to send me this document and I'll have a look. I think from our conversation, I'm understanding sort of the wording, what it looks like. I can look at the different scenarios and then just take a look.\nCLEMENT\n29:02 \nYeah. Yeah. That'll be great. I mean, I'll just send over, I mean, these couple of slides more like a feasibility like check on like the kind of workflows that we want to ensure or instituted to make sure whether or not it's doable. So I can send like… these initial flows that we have developed. And if based on the terminology we talked about is doable, you can let me know especially about the continuity part which you said you look into and also like cancellations, right? So, yeah, okay, great. So I'll send it to you. And if you need any clarification on what certain words mean, like for the way we're describing it here, let me know. Like remember the top part is the old way?\nWrap-Up\nMALLORY\n29:46 \nYes. Yep. Yeah.\nCLEMENT\n29:48 \nYes. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.\nMALLORY\n29:52 \nThanks.\nCLEMENT\n29:53 \nThanks for the call. Speak to you later. Bye.

Well, I'm actually working from home today. We're all iced in here in.\nDAMASO\n0:12 \nI got you. I got you. How was, I guess we haven't chatted in quite some time. How was the holiday break, holidays? Good? New year? All that?\nJESSICA\n0:19 \nYes, yes, it was fine. I took up a few days and spent time with my daughter and visited friends. So, how about your yourself?\nDAMASO\n0:26 \nYeah, same here on this sense. You know, we even me being down here in Miami nowadays, it's we didn't you know, we weren't immune to the arctic blast that happened. They got down to the forties here. So, which is like crazy. I know that's my comparison is not anything too, you know, I guess that bad. But down here though, like a lot of places like especially the older units, especially with the elderly community. Like a lot of places don't have heat. So, it actually was a big issue for a lot of folks down here, but living in an apartment wasn't that big deal. So, but I have my parents come down to visit, spent the holidays with them. It actually felt like Christmas because it was a little bit cold, you know? So I appreciate that. At least in that New Year's, everything spent time with Lawrence family. So it was good.\nSmall Talk ends\nJESSICA\n1:12 \nOkay. So.\nDAMASO\n1:14 \nThen once you believe it, we're already at the end of January and already about to get 2023 is off to a hot and fast start.\nJESSICA\n1:24 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n1:25 \nWell, anyways, we appreciate you taking the time to catch up with us today. I know kind of reconnecting and kind of picking up where we left off, right?\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n1:35 \nI know there was a lot of opportunity to us for us to talk about services and things like that. Especially now transitioning back to a team of one, right back to the drawing board list, let's try to figure out when it comes to this project and it's still being a priority. You know, what are the proper expectations that we should accept when it comes to onboarding and support resources? And then also what additional options do we have on the table that you may want to consider to help supplement you? And I guess one, right? So to help us have that conversation, I did include a member of our services team.\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n2:09 \nHer name is Stephen. She is one of my close counterparts working on the services side of the business. She actually previously was a Docebo account manager. So working directly with our clients. So nobody better to speak with when it comes to the service options that we have available that you may want to consider.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAMASO\n2:24 \nBut also thinking about what does the Docebo experience look like when it comes to engaging with your support staff coming from the Docebo team? So I'll go and let Steph say hello real quick and it's going to be largely her show today. So I'll let her take it away.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n2:39 \nI was so great to meet you, Jessica. Thanks for taking the time and happy to spend some time today talking through what our methodology and what the Docebo experience looks like from the 40 fourth view, but also discuss some options, you know, to supplement some support for you to ensure that implementation goes as smoothly as possible and leads to long term success.\nOnboarding ends\nJESSICA\n3:05 \nOkay.\nSTEPHANIE\n3:07 \nYeah. A couple of questions. Have you implemented an LMS previously?\nJESSICA\n3:16 \nNo, I did like all the initial classes for one, but I didn't do like the actual implementation side. So I was like the first instructors and first classes designed on it but not, I guess this side of it.\nSTEPHANIE\n3:30 \nRight. The full admin? So to say, okay, that's fine. At least you played a role and have some experience. So that's great. Tell me a little bit about maybe some anxieties that you might be thinking when, you know, I understand that there's been changes at the organization that seems to be a very common topic these days, but tell me a little bit about, you know, what some of your anxieties or even questions you might have when thinking about a project like this and taking it on.\nOnboarding\nJESSICA\n4:05 \nI think time allocation, right? So then I know because like right now this morning, like I'm doing all the ID work right now. I'm making videos like, you know, it's that one man band type of thing. So I'd be really curious for, I know we had like the estimates for a team during implementation but during implementation and then also just like post implementation, just running it solo. So then I can begin to kind of resource plan if that makes sense kind of short term long term.\nSTEPHANIE\n4:35 \nSure. And I know that you saw some of the, you know, the pieces of the project and who, what roles they'd be allocated to. Are there other roles within the organization such as it and marketing that you'd still be able to pull on?\nJESSICA\n4:50 \nIt, yes, in terms of marketing, like they would do like they would help me do like a roll out in terms of communications and all of that, yes.\nSTEPHANIE\n4:58 \nYeah. And something else to consider would be branding. There's usually a style guide or they want to have a say when it comes to those types of things. So they could probably provide you at least if they could provide you with resources sometimes they wanna do hands on. So.\nCoach & Share\nJESSICA\n5:14 \nI have the style guide and all the fans and peers and, or I'm good friends with the style guide. So.\nSTEPHANIE\n5:20 \nOkay, perfect. Excellent. At least if you have some additional resources that you can pull on when it comes to those specific topics… but we can talk through some of these pieces.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n5:36 \nUnfortunately, I can't buy your time. I wish that I could do that for myself even in my personal life, but, you know, we do have other resources that could assist and support in different areas that may be able to take some of the burden off you so that, you know, not all the weight is on your shoulders but what I'd like to do is take you through and kind of talk through what our methodology and what the experience would look like so that you have an understanding. I prefer conversation. So please feel free to interrupt me. I'll just let me share my screen here. And if you can just give me a confirmation when you can see it.\nJESSICA\n6:24 \nAn…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jessica spoke about anxieties she had when it came to taking on a project like this, particularly regarding time allocation and resources from IT & Marketing departments.  END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n13:51 \nAnd one thing that I will add to what stuff just walk us through as well. I think perhaps the biggest takeaways. So all of this is kind of understanding as a part of our general onboarding and ongoing support packages, right? This is the team that typically our customers will expect to be working with. So you have your solutions deployment manager, who's your primary point of contact during the onboarding process. Then from their post, you know, end of your onboarding period, then that's where the account manager and then all the subsequent resources that they have at their disposal will pick up where that solution deployment manager left off and they'll be responsible for those kind of ongoing support activities, right? So typically, we would expect by the end of that onboarding period, you all will have fully gone live with the product or, you know, let's say kicked off to where it's been made available to all the learners that you expect be engaging with the platform for the use cases that we've discussed now, that's kind of the general sense as we start signing and thinking about perhaps there might be some custom options that we may want to include as part of that package and so on, right? That you all may want to consider some of the biggest factors that play into all of that is one understanding one, you know, who's going to be, you know, what resources do you have at your disposal in order to help support with this? Because that gets an idea as far as, or are there specific roles or areas for expertise from our team that would make sense to include as a part of the custom package or a, you know, we've already talked about. This is largely a team of one. You might have some support from, you know, marketing for example, or, you know, it, and so on. So that part of it I think makes sense talking about timelines as well. While there isn't necessarily a firm, go live date or deadline that you all may have. It still is helpful for us to understand in terms of resources and how much time we may want to think about including additional outside of what's generally already included. That also is helpful to us as well. So, you know, when it comes to potential kickoff. So when it gets started and thinking about who from our team, it's going to be available and, you know, how we should plan to do our own resource planning to help supplement your own strategy. I guess any considerations or guidance you can help give both Steph and I with regards to all right, if we were to get started on this as the team stands as it is today on your end and who we could think about tapping from the Docebo side. Any ideas with regards to like who or when we can expect to actually get started with that process so that we know, you know, who is going to be around to set that?\nJESSICA\n16:19 \nIs that a question? Or are you a statement, how you phrase that?\nDAMASO\n16:22 \nStatement? Yes, sorry question. Sorry, anyways, question, key takeaway is that in terms of getting started, when would you actually hope to begin the kickoff process that step?\nJESSICA\n16:35 \nWell, I mean just thinking logistics here. So probably convene the stakeholder team hopefully in about another two Ish weeks and they make a choice.\nPricing\nJESSICA\n16:46 \nAnd then at that point is usually at least 30 days of lawyers negotiating, right? So that puts two months right there. And if it takes at least three months to implement, that puts us at five months out at least for go live date, I would probably.\nDAMASO\n17:01 \nYeah, sounds good.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n17:02 \nSo let's kinda coincide with your timelines, let's say executive approvals to your point. Let's get let's just call it three weeks, right? So that puts us about mid February or mid February towards the end of February. So then by that point, to your point, it could take anywhere from, you know, a handful of weeks, sometimes upwards of a month to go through the legal negotiations, contracts, things like that we do just so you know, try to make it as easy as possible or have that process go as smoothly as we can. So we could expedite it where we can too. So there's definitely the things that we could do in partnership between our legal team and yours to make that happen as quickly as possible. And then I think there's another thing too. I may have messaged you offline about, I can't remember, but we also are running a promo right now where you get an extra free 20 courses to sign up before the end of March 30 first from our catalog, which is good.\nOnboarding ends\nJESSICA\n17:54 \nI know that one happening because that tomorrow.\nDAMASO\n17:57 \nBut no, not January 30 first March there.\nJESSICA\n18:01 \nOkay. I was like.\nDAMASO\n18:03 \nYeah. So we definitely have time there. So that's definitely an incentive that I think would be helpful for you all to consider. Now… with that in mind for all of us, I think knowing where we're at right now and what we'd expect to do, I can tell you right now, this is a project that, you know, I know we've been working on for quite some time.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n18:25 \nAnd now I can tell you our team is incredibly motivated to ensure that, you know, we feel like we're the best fit for what you're looking to do. We hope you feel the same. But also we are incredibly motivated to, you know, address any and all concerns to make this decision for you and the rest of the team as easily as possible and hopefully mutually agreed to partner so that we can gonna begin the process to effectively support your team. So we'll do what we can to ensure that decision for you all is made easy for you. But certainly, as we have these discussions especially over the course of the next couple of weeks, please let us know if there's any things that we can continue to provide you through support or discussions around different areas, concerns you all may have otherwise then let us know. We're happy to try to make sure we can do it we can, so not to steal stuff's, thunder. But I think that information is definitely helpful for us to think about when it comes to timelines and things like that. Especially when we're thinking about resources to then eventually pull into the team depending on which additional custom package or support options you may want to consider, which I guess is a good segment to pass back to step and talk about, you know, what other options we have available for you all to think?\nOnboarding ends\nSTEPHANIE\n19:30 \nYeah. The other thing that I didn't mention Jessica was that are phenomenal resources. Docebo Community. I can't say enough about our Docebo community and the Growth that it has had over the last year. We have extremely active users and this community is providing you with other users much like yourself. So you don't have to just listen to Docebo. We may be a little bit biased but there's other users much like yourself that have overcome various hurdles or solved for different problems using Docebo. And all of these stories are shared within the community. It, you have access to ongoing conversations, historical events, upcoming events, bit, webinars, we always like to educate our users.\nAbout Docebo\nSTEPHANIE\n20:26 \nWe have a full customer education team and that runs do table university is very active in the community. And another, just in my experience in supporting do table clients. After your onboarding project has been completed, you have access, we turn on a functionality to communicate with our support agents via chat.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso and Jessica discussed the onboarding process for Docebo, including timelines and resources.\n• Jessica expects to wait up to five months for a go-live date due to legal negotiations. \n END"}

If that's simple, it's just handy to have and I've heard a lot of positive feedback from customers with that functionality.\nJESSICA\n21:30 \nYeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n21:33 \nYeah, but anything throughout the onboarding process is managed by your solution deployment managers.\nAbout Docebo\nSTEPHANIE\n21:40 \nSo you don't have to worry about that they at least take on that communication for you and looking into anything that you might stumble across.\nDAMASO\n21:47 \nYou know, it's actually timely that we're talking about this because just last week, we had our company wide kickoff that was largely sales and marketing focus, but we had a lot of stakeholders coming from the customer success, customer experience side of the business and our SVP heading up that customer experience group.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAMASO\n22:06 \nJerry cook. He put it this way. He said this year, it's always been our priority but this year, we want to make sure there's no avoidance of doubt. We are trying to bear hug our customers with resources and the support that they need just to ensure that they feel confident. And, you know, what it is that they expect from Docebo and what they're able to do with the product itself. So definitely a major priority for us as it always has been. But definitely, that's something that we're focusing on especially as we think about adding more headcount to that.\nIntegrations\nJESSICA\n22:37 \nYeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n22:37 \nAbsolutely. So talk, do you mind if I ask you a few questions, Jessica, just about the overall project? And so your content currently, it's mostly around safety. Is that by a third party provider or is it items that you've created in house?\nJESSICA\n23:00 \nOur safety content is primarily all outsourced right now.\nIntegrations ends\nJESSICA\n23:04 \nOkay. We have since the summer since I started the L and D team, we've have created a few like custom modules that some form packages that we'll need to import. We have like a lot of videos right now because that's like the hot demand is like micro learning videos. So like I was saying, that's what I was editing beforehand. So we don't necessarily have like full blown curriculums, it, but we have like components like a lot of videos. Is that a few quizzes? Like some blueprint reading, but a lot of what we've created… is not safety. It's all manufacturing centric. So it's all like lines, yeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n23:52 \nOkay. Okay.\nJESSICA\n23:53 \nAnd I should back up prior to me starting, we have an entire suite if you will of mine scorm like using a different system… but we have many… like beginner intermediate and advanced modules for each part of the Cam line that we would need to put into the system.\nIntegrations\nSTEPHANIE\n24:17 \nOkay. Okay. Perfect.\nDAMASO\n24:20 \nOne thing on that too. And then I guess this is really more for stuff, but because we are also thinking about including content as a part of the overall total package that can is considering that also would mean that they would get that additional content curation specialist resource. That would be a part of the team. We haven't talked about much yet. But think of them, Jessica is like another person from the side that's going to be working with you as your content specialist. Think of them. This is like your library. And I know when we had conversations with William talking about content back in the day… that resource is there and available to serve you as almost like an extension of your team.\nIntegrations ends\nDAMASO\n24:57 \nSo you should shouldn't have to feel like you have to become intimately familiar with everything we have available in our content catalog that's what that additional support resource is there to help fill that need for you.\nIntegrations\nDAMASO\n25:08 \nSo if you have special requirements as far as this type of training in this format and in this, you know, preferred duration and things like that, you let them know to curate those samples for you and then work back and forth with you to ensure all right is what we recommend from our providers.\nLearning Plans\nDAMASO\n25:22 \nLet's get this into your platform and then start adding into your learning plans or curriculums. Things like that you had mentioned to your employees. So… just one more great person to expect to work with especially if we include content.\nJESSICA\n25:36 \nA lot of stuff too right now would have to be like for learning plans.\nLearning Plans ends\nJESSICA\n25:41 \nLike we're still developing the matrices like for each role in our manufacturing sites. And I've been working really hard to try and like to find those. Like what does you know, fabricator level one, level two, while the level one, level two et cetera. You know, receiving clerk level one whatever for all of that. But a lot of what we need is probably going to be like self select right now until that gets further because again, I mean we're still just we're starting this here. There's we're building the foundation.\nDAMASO\n26:14 \nYep.\nSTEPHANIE\n26:14 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n26:15 \nOne quick thing on that point too. I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hijacking the meeting but talking about some of what you just brought up with regards to the matrices and the different learning paths and curriculums we're going to be making available that might be role specific.\nIntegrations\nDAMASO\n26:29 \nA lot of that can also be associated with skills training as well. And whether or not that's a high emphasis for your organization, you know, performance management especially, you know, it's another way of thinking about that. There's actually some revamps that we've made to the Docebo skills module that is now already now included with your purchase to learn LMS.\nIntegrations ends\nDAMASO\n26:48 \nSo I know we haven't spent much time talking about that much less having seen that module in action, but I think at some point if it makes sense before we start bringing everything to the table to the rest of the executive team and so on. I think having a brief walkthrough of what the skills module entails and show you what's included with that along with learn might be helpful just to kinda give you a better feel for, hey, this isn't just the LMS. Now, we have a potential skills and performance management aspect available. Okay. So anyways, there's quick aside, but.\nIntegrations\nSTEPHANIE\n27:19 \nAnd I understand that U KG is your HRIS. So that would be your source of truth for people data.\nJESSICA\n27:29 \nYes, except for international entities which are not on that. So that would be excel spreadsheet. Okay? Like a CV?\nSTEPHANIE\n27:36 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n27:37 \nYeah. I think we talked about this, the UKG integration, whether we decide to do it be APIs using the Automation app, we have different methods by which we'll extract that information from the UK put into the table and vice versa. Again, we talked about it, their customer are, so it makes for a good relationship to have that data feed work very well. But then secondarily for those international entities or people who operate outside of the continental us or actually said just North America, for those folks, we have that template for that bulk upload that you could use there even there might be opportunities to leverage the Automation app, just coming from different data sources?\nJESSICA\n28:16 \nYeah. Okay. And.\nSTEPHANIE\n28:17 \nSpeaking about integrations, are there any other systems within your tech stack such as you have a CRM or that sort of thing of any sort? Is there any integrations that you can think of that would be important?\nJESSICA\n28:35 \nIn terms of systems like PG, that we're running? Yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jessica mentioned that most of her safety content was outsourced, but they had created some custom modules in house for manufacturing centric training such as videos, quizzes, and blueprints reading. \n• Jessica also noted she was working on building matrices for each role at their manufacturing sites while developing learning plans for employees too.   END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n28:39 \nAnything outside of that, you could see syncing.\nJESSICA\n28:43 \nWe'll need to pull data from some other things like where we get our anti harassment training or cyber security, how we're running that right now. So all that data will have to get eventually like put over into that because I'm hoping we can just start running everything through one once all those contracts run.\nIntegrations\nDAMASO\n29:01 \nWhere, where are those currently being managed separately?\nJESSICA\n29:07 \nBefore in apex?\nDAMASO\n29:10 \nGotcha. I know we talked about that and I think that was an opponent built into the data migration services we talked about too migrating over that legacy information. And then eventually, if you decided to stay with those providers, I know we talked about with our content catalog, we would have some viable alternatives that might have if not the same content but maybe even better content on those subjects that you're currently utilizing those providers for today. That will be your opportunity then to then use and route all of that content delivery through the platform. And so you click save there. But then we still get all the historical records that you decided to bring in or if you continue using those providers, export that content, have it live to platform. And then you get the benefit of all the.\nIntegrations ends\nJESSICA\n29:55 \nRight. And we need to pull from Ispring to all of our customer data because that's where we're using for our customers right now. Okay? So that I'll need to get pulled over as well. And that's where all of our like nine modules are living right now. And the rest of the stuff I'm just running as like MP four and each five stuff off Sharepoint because there's no centralized location. Yeah. And then we'll have some excel files from Sharepoint to just like forums, that type of thing. We're trying to keep track of what we can, how we can.\nSTEPHANIE\n30:28 \nAnd I love that you use them. You know, you spoke about building a foundation because I cannot speak to that enough even in supporting clients with Docebo is that, you know, generally go and look for a solution that to solve for XYZ. But in order to solve for that long term, the foundation does have to be built. So you have to look at that bigger picture and build that strong foundation and go from there. And I always recommend that you start small.\nJESSICA\n31:01 \nYeah. Polyeah, we would start domestically like in my perfect world which is not everybody else's world. So, you know, there's the disclaimer in the warning.\nBranches & Groups\nSTEPHANIE\n31:12 \nHow…\nJESSICA\n31:13 \nHow it would work, but yeah, I would wanna kind of launch each location domestically, one by one like do a beta group and then location by location to kind of really kind of control, you know, with me just being one person?\nSTEPHANIE\n31:29 \nYeah, it's…\nJESSICA\n31:30 \nFine. I just kinda had a brainstorm as we're talking.\nBranches & Groups ends\nJESSICA\n31:36 \nI'm not going sure what other you said to trigger it, but I know the leads at manufacturing. I don't know if you've worked a lot of the manufacturing friends, but sometimes they're skeptical. So I had put together a presentation when we had the trial version, but any screenshots that you guys could potentially send to me of like… just like a group lead or a manufacturing manager, like basically out on the floor, how they would see the system would be helpful in terms of them entering just like an overall training for people or if they wanted to like assign something to somebody?\nDAMASO\n32:21 \nYeah, I can do that.\nJESSICA\n32:22 \nLike see their list of people like here's. My people here's what they've done because I try to do a whole as much as I could then, but it's…\nDAMASO\n32:30 \nYou, could you share with me what you have and you don't have to do it now but we can take it offline share with me what you have. So I see what screenshots you already have put together. So then that way I know what you already have. So I'm not replicating it, but then I can show you some of the additional stuff I might recommend showing to help fill those.\nJESSICA\n32:48 \nOkay. Yeah, I will try and do that today.\nDAMASO\n32:51 \nOkay, cool. Thanks.\nSTEPHANIE\n32:52 \nSpeaking of that, your Mac or your managers on the manufacturing floor? Are they doing in person training a lot with machinery or?\nJESSICA\n33:05 \nYeah, it's mainly all JT and the goal is kind of again building that foundation trying to shift the mindset, like you're always gonna have JT. I'm sorry, I cannot teach someone how to tag well with the video entirely like you need that hands on experience. So we need to be able to track that JT very easily, right? Without a lot of clicks. And then what can be replicated is what I'm trying to get them to save time on and see the value and like I just did a blueprint basics for fabrication and they're like the symbols like you don't have to explain this over and over again. Like that's something we can kinda more automate to make their lives easier.\nSTEPHANIE\n33:44 \nYeah. And are there… timeline requirements for certification of machinery or that sorta thing?\nJESSICA\n33:52 \nYeah, the system, absolutely we would need to track. So, I mean, think of our company in terms of in terms of groups of people, there's like Professional services, which would be our engineers. So they have all sorts of Professional engineering like, you know, their licenses, their credits, their continuing education. Like we have to be able to track all of that. We have seven different engineering departments alone, like a lot of companies like just the like engineer. No, we have electrical, we are very it up with that have Professional services. You have construction. And then we also have one, am I missing manufacturing? Okay? So there's kind of those three big areas. And then with each of those, there's tons of different departments if you will. And even within Professional services, like there's definite relation because when we talk about like start up and conditioning of a plant, those people are housed in Professional services, but then they go over to site like a lot of our Professional services, people are on site for like months at a time. Okay? Sorry, my computer locked up for a second.\nSTEPHANIE\n35:01 \nOkay.\nJESSICA\n35:06 \nAnd when I say site that's like anywhere in the world, all six continents. So.\nSTEPHANIE\n35:11 \nOkay.\nJESSICA\n35:15 \nAll right.\nSTEPHANIE\n35:17 \nYeah. So what does change management looks like look like from your perspective, when you think of rolling a system like this?\nJESSICA\n35:28 \nThat you got a walk before you can run for, you, can, you know, for you can run free and just fly, I guess?\nSTEPHANIE\n35:36 \nYeah.\nJESSICA\n35:37 \nYeah. So it's going to be like I said, building the matrices and building those foundational items that help them save time and then go from there in terms of getting into more than skills and competencies. It's more just like how can we track everything first? And what can I do to make life easier? Then move into like the social components and other aspects of it? That makes sense? Like, yeah, that's my plan. If you have other ideas, I'm always open to suggestions, so.\nSTEPHANIE\n36:09 \nYeah, no, that makes sense. I think it's just the key is getting them in, right?\nJESSICA\n36:16 \nYeah. And it's gotta be like perfectly smooth and super simple like those first few items. So that's why I'm like just tracking what they need to track in terms of safety or whatever or credits. And then like some basic intro things like we have some custom things we created for custom software that we have like race track, connect. Those are custom softwares that we've created for us for various aspects of our company. So like those basic kind of intro modules like people doing those and then build there because.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso and Jessica discussed the need to migrate data from various sources, such as anti-harassment training or cyber security.\n• They also spoke about integrating content delivery through a platform, pulling data from Ispring for customers, building a foundation with Docebo and starting small domestically.\n• Stephanie asked whether managers on the manufacturing floor were doing in person training with machinery; Jessica responded that they would have to track JT easily without many clicks and automate certain processes like tagging well in video. \n• She also mentioned there being timeline requirements for certification of machinery, tracking Professional Services Engineers' licenses/credits/continuing education across seven departments plus Construction & Manufacturing groups worldwide - all while trying to make life easier by introducing custom software modules into their system.

{"prompt":"STEPHANIE\n36:49 \nYeah. Okay. Sounds good. So back to the phased approach. What timeline would you associate to that? So if you're doing, you know, one group and then building and you're doing this individually with each group would do you envision that taking a year, six months, what's your hope there?\nJESSICA\n37:11 \nI mean, yeah, I would love to have a lot of locations done domestically by the end of the year. Yeah… but only time will tell right now and especially because there's so many unknowns with the economy right now, you guys have seen them used in the past week. I don't have to tell you how many is there have been white color with Microsoft and Google and everything else? So… in the tech industry. So… okay, I would, I know you guys wanna date. I would love a date too. It's just not possible to give you like a specific month right now.\nSTEPHANIE\n37:47 \nYeah, yeah, no, by end of the year is definitely a realistic goal. And that makes sense to me.\nJESSICA\n37:52 \nYeah. Now, whether that will happen, who knows, lots of caveats? Disclaimers?\nSTEPHANIE\n37:57 \nAbsolutely, totally understand. And one last piece that I was curious about was SSO, is that currently a requirement to have SSO capability?\nJESSICA\n38:11 \nYeah, we should be able to do that now. I'm not gonna say anything more than, yeah, we should be able to allow it people to handle that tech.\nDAMASO\n38:21 \nAnd I feel like we may have talked about this, but forgive me, it's been awhile and I can remember, but do you happen to know off the top of your head which SSO provider you're currently using?\nJESSICA\n38:32 \nNo, I don't actually.\nDAMASO\n38:33 \nOkay. Something to double check on just because when we think about, you know, special considerations we may want to think about for from a technical standpoint, setting up that. So it's something that we do, we can't get those set up with your single sign on provider.\nIntegrations\nDAMASO\n38:48 \nAnd we do work with most of them usual suspects would be like, you know, an OT, which is what we use internally or like Microsoft Azure, active directory, things like that. So double check with your it folks just to see and confirm because either way, you know, depending on the product, it does take a certain level of understanding or kind of expertise setting that stuff up skills depending on what that is. So any information you're able to find out, relate to us on that subject will be helpful.\nJESSICA\n39:18 \nOkay. I just messaged one of the it gurus.\nDAMASO\n39:21 \nYou…\nSTEPHANIE\n39:23 \nAlways get down connections yep. So there are other pieces that we can support. It all depends where, you know, I've seen individuals stand up a solution on their own. So one LMS admin, it is doable. But again back to your earlier point about time, it all depends.\nIntegrations ends\nSTEPHANIE\n39:46 \nAnd if you're being pulled in different ways to create content build matrices, you know, all of these different pieces and all these different hats that you're going to have to put on… just know that we do have alternative resources. What I mean by that is we've got a partner network and we generally will lean on them for hands on configuration.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n40:13 \nThese are certified Docebo experts that can be an extension of your team. So you can have them as part of your team for a certain time period or it could be a bucket of hours, for example. So you can purchase a bucket of hours to be part of your onboarding project. They would join the kickoff call with you and they could have designated tasks that will take off some of that work for you. So for example, you have to do some ID and you have to focus on that. Maybe there's a week that you can't focus on building the solution. Then all of that work can go to another LMS administrator that can do the hands on configuration for you and know that they're experts in the solution. So their turnaround time is generally faster.\nJESSICA\n41:06 \nSo, can you be more, can you give more details? Like, so they would handle the configuration for that week? So what are they handling? Like cost? Like, yes, more detail.\nLearning Plans\nSTEPHANIE\n41:18 \nYeah, for sure. So it can vary. So as I, you know, going back to that project plan that I spoke to, those different topics will be allocated to certain weeks and it all depends on what you are trying to accomplish. So, you know, we'll give you an example of learning plans. You want to set up learning plans. They can do all that. They can set up all the learning plans. They can set up the enrollment rules, they can set up Notifications for you, but we still want you to be enabled. So those topics you will still learn about, but you won't have to do the actual configuration.\nLearning Plans ends\nSTEPHANIE\n41:57 \nWe would just have someone come in with you and do all that work. They can be part of your weekly calls with your solution appointment manager as well. So the cost, I can follow up with an email on some of the different options in terms of the buckets of hours, whether it's 50 hours, whether it's 100 hours. And I can even, you know, specify some key topics if that's of interest. Yes. But they can also do the entire implementation for you. So it's really flexible as to what the, you know, what the possibilities are.\nJESSICA\n42:36 \nAnd then I would need if they did the entire implementation, I would just need to, I mean, I would need to produce all the matrices of what we need for each role and just access to all the scoring files.\nSTEPHANIE\n42:48 \nYeah, yeah.\nJESSICA\n42:49 \nCSV files and everything. Okay?\nSTEPHANIE\n42:51 \nOkay.\nJESSICA\n42:54 \nYes, please send me some polls and estimates for that.\nSTEPHANIE\n42:57 \nYeah, yeah. And that's the other thing to consider is that you would act more of a project manager role in a sense… you know, to be the correspondent on your side, provide access to different documentation and that sort of thing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Stephanie and Jessica discussed a phased approach for onboarding, with the goal of having many locations done domestically by the end of the year.\n• They also discussed SSO capability and which provider they are currently using; Jessica does not know. \n• Stephanie suggested that Jessica look into getting an extension to her team in order to help with configuration tasks such as setting up learning plans, enrollment rules, notifications etc., either through a bucket of hours or complete implementation option. \n• Lastly, Stephanie mentioned that if they decided on any kind of implementation plan then Jessica would act more like a project manager role providing access to documentation etc. END"}
{"prompt":"STEPHANIE\n43:17 \nAnd we'd still want you to be enabled along the way as well. So the other piece there's also sometimes design as a topic, you know, so branding out your pages. So you talked about, you have so many different groups, there's you know, seven engineering groups alone if they each need to have a unique experience. So a landing page I'm on the manufacturing floor, maybe I want just a very simple page… you want, you have to design that out. Well, we could do that for you or if you have a manager group that has very specific needs and you want a distinct landing page for them to land on, we can support in building out those pages and those unique experiences as well. So design is another very common topic that comes up to ensure that you're maintaining your branding and, you know, it is very user friendly within Docebo. I started Docebo. That was one of the first things that I did was building out my demo platform and I was done at how easy it is because I am not a technical person at all, but, you know, it's just another piece. You can get very fancy with any HTML or CSS and if you don't have experience using that coding language or that, then we do have resources available that can take that lift off you as well. So.\nJESSICA\n44:48 \nOkay. Yeah, please send me quotes for all of that.\nSTEPHANIE\n44:50 \nOkay. Okay. Any other questions or… you know, concerns even I'm more than happy to address.\nLayout & Content ends\nJESSICA\n45:05 \nThose, no, I'm feeling slightly more overwhelmed now. So I just need…\nSTEPHANIE\n45:09 \nNo… that wasn't the purpose of this call? No.\nJESSICA\n45:18 \nIt was good. It was all informational and it's just, I mean, it's just a lot for one person.\nSTEPHANIE\n45:23 \nIt is, it is absolutely, and there's no denying that… but I'm being completely honest with you when I was an account manager, the amount of people that spun up a solution on their own, I was stunned and the simple fact of it is that the way that we have our onboarding setup is to really support that.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n45:52 \nWe, yes, you've been shown, you know, the different resources that come into play. But this is like the max really that are needed and it's not always needed. We just wanna make sure that you're covered off. But even the simple fact that I don't want you to walk away from this meeting thinking that you can't do this on your own, okay?\nJESSICA\n46:14 \nI know I have to like it's good. I will get it done.\nSTEPHANIE\n46:21 \nBut on the other hand, you know, we still have, we do have resources available that if you need to pull on them and you need additional support, they're there to support you.\nJESSICA\n46:32 \nOkay.\nSTEPHANIE\n46:33 \nAt the end of the day, your success is our success. So, you know, we want to be in it for a long term partnership and set you up for success that's it. So we're here to support you no matter.\nJESSICA\n46:48 \nOkay. Thank you.\nDAMASO\n46:52 \nAwesome. Well, I guess Jessica, we have about 12 minutes left of our originally, a lot of time for today. So any other questions related to services or otherwise that, you know, we can help answer between Steph? And?\nJESSICA\n47:06 \nNo, no. I have my list to do. I'm gonna find out our SSO provider. You guys are going to send me some quotes on things. Do I'll send you what I have so far in terms of a kind of a presentation?\nJESSICA\n47:27 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n47:28 \nYeah. And then, yeah, for us, our action items are to put together kind of a listing of the services that step talked through with us today and kinda let you know in terms of like, you know, you wanna purchase like buckets?\nOnboarding ends\nJESSICA\n47:41 \nOurs?\nDAMASO\n47:41 \nWhat's included with different services and things like that, I'll send that will send that over to you in a email later today. And then once I take a look at this, what you'll send me in terms of the screenshots, I'll have a better idea as far as what I should go back into your demo instance and pull from as well or take a look at some other providers than ours, the other customers of ours and see what I could replicate. But other than that, I think we should be in good Shape. The only other thing I was going to go back to was the skills module again that's something that I think might be something, it may not be a phase one thing, but if you're thinking long term partnership here, that might be something that would be worth considering especially as you're thinking about socializing this with the team. You gotta kinda emphasize kind of the long term fit and things you have available to scale into. And again, because it's all for free that's one of those things that might as well know what options you have on the table that's going to be included already. So if you'd like I can… bring Scott back into the mix and we can play go through that together again, you know, it can be as early as this week, pretty much whatever schedules permit.\nNext Steps\nJESSICA\n48:47 \nYeah. Let's do that. Let me look at my calendar do?\nDAMASO\n48:51 \nI wanted to ask you had the meeting with Michael Michelle last week? Is that right on Friday?\nNext Steps ends\nJESSICA\n48:56 \nI did. Yeah. So.\nDAMASO\n48:57 \nWas it?\nJESSICA\n48:58 \nYeah, he's a talker.\nDAMASO\n49:00 \nIt's kind of a, you know.\nJESSICA\n49:04 \nYeah, but I did enjoy just listening to his thoughts and I think he validated a lot of kind of the approach that I'm taking because again use that foundation word like I have to build this slowly and carefully so there's buying and people see the value and validity and not trying to be a silo at all times.\nDAMASO\n49:24 \nDoing their.\nJESSICA\n49:25 \nDifferent items because our company has all these different components, but we have to work together.\nDAMASO\n49:30 \nYeah, exactly. It's great to feel validated by one of the industry leaders literally like both him and his team. Like they are the on the forefront of anything that's HR, L and D related. So I think it was good to be able to connect you with them. So glad to hear the conversation.\nNext Steps\nJESSICA\n49:47 \nYeah, I have openings like a fair amount of openings randomly throughout the week. So you just kinda let me know when…\nDAMASO\n49:54 \nYeah. So I'm looking at Scott and I schedule, we can do something Wednesday is kind of out of the question. But if you wanted to where Thursday afternoon is mostly free for him and I, we can do any time from one PM central until four PM on Thursday.\nJESSICA\n50:13 \nLet's do one PM. I'll block off one PM to two PM right now.\nDAMASO\n50:17 \nOkay. Sounds good. We'll block it for an hour. I don't think it'll take that long to go through it. Just really, if there's anything else that you wanna make sure that we go through together, it could be a refresher on certain things or other questions you may have or if you wanna invite some other folks to take a look, but depending on their questions, just let us know, but I'll send that to you here shortly and then we have the stuff that will work back and forth on that will take off line.\nWrap-Up\nJESSICA\n50:38 \nOkay, cool. Perfect.\nDAMASO\n50:40 \nGood. All righty. Well, step, we appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks for the great information that you're able to give us today and…\nJESSICA\n50:50 \nStand for in your background there's the U over your.\nSTEPHANIE\n50:54 \nYeah, shoulder. It's actually just an empty vase.\nJESSICA\n50:58 \nOkay.\nSTEPHANIE\n50:59 \nYeah. I wish it stood for something more exciting but.\nSmall Talk\nDAMASO\n51:06 \nI like.\nJESSICA\n51:07 \nIt in the little point man. So.\nSTEPHANIE\n51:09 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n51:10 \nLooking at it reminded me of that sponge Bob episode. We're east you in fun when he's filling out that myself. I'm still a child. So anyways, all right, cool. Team. Well, I'll go and let you get back to it again. Any questions? Just let us know. Otherwise, Jessica, keep an eye for the fall. We'll catch up again on Thursday.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jessica requested quotes for the services discussed and will send screenshots of her presentation to Stephanie.\n• Lastly, they scheduled a meeting between Scott & Jessica to discuss further details next Thursday from 1-2 PM Central Time END"}
{"prompt":"AMY\n6:45 \nSo just like for context and like going into our review in a couple of weeks like that's just some good context to.\nMIRANDA\n6:54 \nYeah.\nAMY\n6:54 \nThese are kinda shifting on our end.\nMIRANDA\n6:56 \nSure. That's great for me to know. Thank you for sharing that.\nAMY\n7:00 \nSo, and then Greg, I guess we can jump in.\nGREGORY\n7:03 \nYeah.\nAMY\n7:04 \nTechnical things that are lingering.\nGREGORY\n7:07 \nThat's actually, yeah, that whole reorg thing too is kinda, you know, been on my mind cause we anticipate getting those new Branches and having that fit with our user structure there to like figure out how that's going to go down with the, because right now we're doing the FTP import from Workday right? And so I was looking through there and I know there's a way to like you create custom categories that match up with the input from the spreadsheet, but that was something that I, since I've never actually done it myself. I was like definitely curious about.\nAMY\n7:38 \nDid it last time? So I would like chat with cat. She can probably just figure out how to do it because I've seen her do it, but she's the one that like owns the folder probably help out in that.\nGREGORY\n7:52 \nEspecially.\nAMY\n7:53 \nWe're trying to like get all new pages up because there's so many of our pages refer to these like current, the current structure. And so.\nMIRANDA\n8:02 \nIt's okay. So that's gonna be a big, so as like have you completed the site audit yet?\nAMY\n8:09 \nYes.\nMIRANDA\n8:10 \nOkay.\nAMY\n8:10 \nJust finished on like I wanna say like, was it last Friday or did she just finished it like this week very recently?\nGREGORY\n8:20 \nSay or something? Yeah.\nMIRANDA\n8:22 \nAwesome. And so, I wonder too if that was probably a great exercise to happen right before something like this because at least you can identify where all the changes are that need to be made.\nGREGORY\n8:32 \nYeah, I wrote down the headers too, so it's like you really can just do like a control F, search for any, yeah, it's pretty great.\nMIRANDA\n8:43 \nYeah. And would that just be like adding additional fields with the FTP?\nAMY\n8:49 \nTo be, from moving to Branches and adding in for?\nGREGORY\n8:54 \nBut I'm hoping it happens too is like even before we remove those, right?\nBranches & Groups\nGREGORY\n8:58 \nLike we see the users filter out of them as they get rerouted to the new Branches. And then eventually those two Branches have zero or the instantaneously, those people have zero in those Branches and then we delete them, right?\nMIRANDA\n9:11 \nYeah.\nGREGORY\n9:12 \nThat's what I'm thinking, I don't know. So, yeah, I guess I'll go to talk.\nBranches & Groups ends\nMIRANDA\n9:16 \nFunny how like reorg changes like that have this like domino effect with all the other parts. It's like, yeah, nothing ever happens in a silo, I'm sure they're not even like thinking about how it affects your team too.\nAMY\n9:29 \nNo.\nGREGORY\n9:30 \nNo.\nAMY\n9:30 \nOf course.\nGREGORY\n9:31 \nLike all the little part places it might be written, which is probably like thousands and stuff.\nSmall Talk\nGREGORY\n9:37 \nIt's like all that's gonna have to, it's like it's going to be like writing the wrong year after new years.\nMIRANDA\n9:43 \nAll, it'll drive me crazy trying to hunt it all down. So, I know, sorry, we can get started too, but I worked at a company where we were lominad and the second the a was a capital a, and then we did this whole rebrand and the…\nAMY\n10:01 \nWent through that like a year or two ago. It's the same thing and we still get that we still get the upper qa because like legally like our LLC.\nMIRANDA\n10:10 \nYeah.\nAMY\n10:10 \nUpper keys.\nMIRANDA\n10:11 \nBut…\nAMY\n10:12 \nLike we use a lower?\nMIRANDA\n10:15 \nOkay. Well, that's super embarrassing for me guys because I've been using an upper case.\nGREGORY\n10:20 \nOr like I think I do it too sometimes because that's how I like remember it as before I even worked here, I was like supervisor with the day.\nMIRANDA\n10:27 \nA trip advisor. Is it still all one word?\nAMY\n10:32 \nOne word?\nMIRANDA\n10:33 \nYeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah, cause that's in Salesforce, it says like trip advisor. So, yeah, I was like obsessed with hunting down all capital as, and eliminating them, you know, and life.\nGREGORY\n10:48 \nI bet that happened. I do right?\nAMY\n10:51 \nI…\nGREGORY\n10:51 \nRemember going through.\nAMY\n10:52 \nDecks and like having to change it was.\nMIRANDA\n10:56 \nLike this is old, yeah, or you see some people still have it like the CEO in his signature for so long had the wrong, like logo in.\nAMY\n11:06 \nIt was just…\nMIRANDA\n11:07 \nChange it.\nGREGORY\n11:08 \nNo.\nMIRANDA\n11:10 \nAll right. Okay. Side rant. Okay. Sorry, Greg.\nGREGORY\n11:13 \nOkay. No, that's right? No, that's interesting. But, yeah, as far as other technical issues, I know we had a few just totally like bizarre notification.\nMIRANDA\n11:23 \nYeah.\nGREGORY\n11:23 \nThis come our way, like they got notified on like I would say, they're still kinda coming in the…\nNotifications\nAMY\n11:30 \nThey're common.\nGREGORY\n11:32 \nJust is like errand, weird Notifications kinda popping up and every time I try to like investigate and look into it looks to me like the settings are all configured like I get a little confused with the time zone stuff, but like some of these are happening days before they really should be triggering.\nAbout Docebo\nAMY\n11:49 \nYeah, that's like one of them, which like at one point, I had to make one only for like specifically for the apec region. And I was told like somebody in apex has to do it, which like was fine for a one time thing.\nMIRANDA\n12:04 \nWe…\nAMY\n12:04 \nDon't have anyone on our team who is familiar with the learning cloud in the asian Asia pacific region.\nNotifications\nAMY\n12:13 \nSo it's not really the most feasible to like every notification we made to have to make like and it's mostly in great, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've mostly seen them with like the, we have like reminder enrollment Notifications like one week, one day, one hour. And it's mostly with the one day and one week.\nNotifications ends\nMIRANDA\n12:35 \nI…\nAMY\n12:36 \nHaven't really heard of it for the one hour.\nGREGORY\n12:39 \nYeah. Yeah, that sounds all right. Happened on New Year's yeah, the one that happened on New Year's was one week, I think, right? Or like it was the week.\nAMY\n12:48 \nYeah. And so I think like we had, Greg had submitted a ticket and the outcome better, but I think we, they were kinda like, yeah, this is the way it's opposed to fun. Like it's like.\nMIRANDA\n13:01 \nYeah, this is.\nAMY\n13:01 \nThe way it's opposed to function, they say.\nGREGORY\n13:04 \nIt was.\nMIRANDA\n13:04 \nLike functionality. Yeah.\nGREGORY\n13:07 \nYeah. Yeah. There was. It was kinda like two parts of the problem. Well, yeah, one made sense because it was okay. Yeah, before we get into that one, that one's a complicated one. It was. But yeah, the time based part, he said the person I was working with was great but at the same time, he was just like, well, it's because of time zones. And then, and I try to do the map in my head. I'm like, well, no, no, no, like I think it was like four days off or something then when it should have gone out like it was the third of the day of the week, but it came out on like the first day of the year, I don't know, but it was like time zones on our, yeah, that can only be 24 hour. Yeah.\nAbout Docebo\nAMY\n13:45 \nWe're like so… careful when it comes to time zones and like just for like contact like our company base is a lot smaller in the apac region, but like we, we're like overly careful to make sure that they feel like we're like a very us east coast centric company just because this is where headquarters are.\nAbout Docebo ends\nAMY\n14:10 \nBut we like very much how to make a like a concerted effort to make a pack especially because they're so much smaller, like not feel like everything's kinda us centric. And so, I think like as part of the cloud like, I don't know what the issue with this one notification was. But like the platform in general, I would also say it's like not the most global friendly, like there's no way for example, for them to only see courses that are in their time zone. They have to like go through a bunch of like east coast time courses because we have way more employees here. So there's way more offerings here. They have to like scroll through all of that to find their one little like a friendly session. And like little things like that. I think they're already frustrated by. So then like the Notifications on top of that, like is a little like difficult on our end to explain.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Amy, Miranda and Gregory discussed technical issues related to reorg changes, notifications and Docebo.\n• Amy mentioned that the company is careful to not be too US-centric for their APAC region employees. \n• Greg noted that there were some strange notifications popping up days before they should have been triggered due to time zone settings on the platform. \n• They also discussed how difficult it was for APAC region employees to find courses in their own time zones as most of them are from the East Coast US.

{"prompt":"MIRANDA\n15:13 \nYeah. Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that you've already submitted a ticket for that. I'm sorry, I'm not glad to hear that. What they're claiming is that it's the penalty. But what would be helpful to me, Greg is like if you could potentially find that in your Inbox somewhere and forward that thread to me.\nWrap-Up ends\nMIRANDA\n15:34 \nAnd then from there, like I can hop into Zendesk, I can do some more research and talk to the support agent that awesome. Yeah. So that would be really helpful for me because essentially, like it does sound like part of this is like, yeah, that's like how the platform functions right now with the, you know, the Notifications and other regions like has to be made in the country that's in. I wonder if that's been something that's been brought up in the community. And I will look and see because you can't be the only company, the global company that's running into something like that. And so I'm gonna look in the community and see if it is, and if it is not, I would just request that you make a post and you can get some people to upload it. I'll share it around with my team too and be like, hey, can you guys go up about this? Can we get some traction on this? Because I, you know, like I said, you guys can't be the only one experiencing that?\nAMY\n16:34 \nYeah. So I actually, I just found the ticket and it is, he was basically like, it's hard to find a concrete reason why, which is why it's best to find a consistent way to replicate it. There's so many things working in motion that can trigger it. I would advise you to monitor it and I'm gonna mark this ticket, so.\nMIRANDA\n16:53 \nLike…\nAMY\n16:54 \nBut this is.\nMIRANDA\n16:55 \nNot…\nAMY\n16:55 \nThe first time it's happened?\nMIRANDA\n16:57 \nYeah.\nAMY\n16:57 \nAnd which there's at least one other ticket somewhere related to the same thing?\nMIRANDA\n17:03 \nYeah.\nAMY\n17:03 \nI know it's also happened like periodically with us based employees too. So I'm not sure if it's like also just like a downtime in your system because we've like very recently run into a lot of issues with like reporting. And then they've always been like, yeah, it's like a known issue like the platforms down for a day.\nMIRANDA\n17:26 \nWeek. Yeah.\nAMY\n17:27 \nBeing that we're not notified when these things happen, like we often don't know whether like a problem we encounter is because of a downtime in the system. So like this could be an example of like a downtime in a system and like they're so random and inconsistent like the regions it's happening with when it's happening, the course, like everything is so random that I honestly could be downtime lags, I don't know why the, but there's no way for us to know that. Like, so I assume it's a problem.\nNotifications\nMIRANDA\n18:00 \nSo, no, sorry, go ahead Greg.\nGREGORY\n18:03 \nYeah, it's just like a one tricky part about it too is that we didn't have a way to access… like the log of emails I sent to see if like is this one person who found out and is now submitting? A?\nAMY\n18:18 \nSo.\nGREGORY\n18:18 \nOr is it like everybody and there's just that one person who's like…\nAMY\n18:21 \nYeah… one of my thing too. Like the other notification too, I think it suggested like we BCC or email the account it's sending from on every notification. And first of all, the email we send notification from doesn't actually exist.\nNotifications ends\nGREGORY\n18:42 \nLike…\nAMY\n18:44 \nA legal role and then be like, we don't want 100.\nMIRANDA\n18:49 \nNo.\nAMY\n18:49 \nThe Notifications into the platform.\nMIRANDA\n18:53 \nYeah. I understand where they're coming from, where they're like we have to find some way in order to replicate it for us to name it as a bug. But I get where you're coming from, where you're like that is not feasible for me. My Inbox is full enough as it is. Yeah. Like I wonder if we could like CC some like a support analysts or somebody who's working on the ticket too. Like that's just, I mean, I'll probably get in trouble for saying something like that, but I'm like if we really want to get to the bottom of it, you know, because as what I'm hearing from you is like support said this is, I can't replicate this, but you're seeing it still happen today, you're seeing still happen now. So I'm gonna peer into that ticket a little bit more. What I might ask to is like if you, if we could follow up with some more recent examples like it just any evidence that you have that we can throw at them being like here, it just happened with this notification on this day, it is happening again. Yes, it's sporadic but enough so that it's you know, having a business impact because…\nNotifications\nAMY\n20:01 \nI'm wondering if I can like go back and look because I know like Tony sent me one at one point, then you got that was wrong. Yeah. Like I was saying, I had to sit down with someone at apac and have for like step by step, set up a separate notification for apac for one of the Notifications so that I found that out to be a ticket. So I can probably have a ticket told me to do that too.\nNotifications ends\nMIRANDA\n20:22 \nYeah. Screenshots, screen recordings, anything like that is super helpful too, especially because like the support agents, they're in a bind because they're like if I show this to a product manager, they're going to be like how I don't this isn't enough for me to go off of, you know, so like as long as we can give them like empower them to have more evidence, so to speak, then that should be helpful.\nAMY\n20:49 \nPut something together.\nGREGORY\n20:51 \nYeah, that way you can see it all in one big. Yeah.\nAMY\n20:54 \nYeah.\nGREGORY\n20:55 \nTotally.\nMIRANDA\n20:56 \nYeah.\nGREGORY\n20:57 \nSome of the better like cases we've had maybe or something, although, Amy, I just realized what if we proxy as like Nadia and make up Notifications? We?\nAMY\n21:07 \nLike, I feel like.\nGREGORY\n21:08 \nI just realized that I'm like are…\nAMY\n21:10 \nKinda like, well, first of all, they said they had to be in the like physically in the go. So I…\nGREGORY\n21:17 \nLike proxy is just…\nAMY\n21:19 \nI mean, like their account had to be in it or like they physically had to be sitting in it. I didn't really know what that meant. So I just had her do it.\nGREGORY\n21:27 \nThat makes sense because.\nAMY\n21:29 \nCompanies probably don't replicate every single one of their Notifications to be apac. So I feel like there's another way around it.\nGREGORY\n21:37 \nYeah. Yeah.\nMIRANDA\n21:39 \nYeah.\nGREGORY\n21:39 \nThat makes sense. I get that little time zone notification when I proxy into people. Yeah. So it's probably something. Yeah. Okay. Cool.\nLearning Plans\nAMY\n21:47 \nSo, one notification problem that?\nGREGORY\n21:51 \nThere was also one that was like clearly defined that we figured out together and it's basically like Docebo… we, and it was like almost like a feature request because we wanted to notify when there was an incomplete learning plan. Like here, the course we haven't taken yet in this learning plan. But what have ended up happening? Is it's like if you've ever taken a course within that learning plan, what was it again?\nAMY\n22:17 \nFor example, so we have like a manager development program that has like a series of courses, six to seven courses that people have to complete when they're new to the company or newly promoted as a manager.\nLearning Plans ends\nAMY\n22:28 \nAnd there was a recent course that was added called interviewing skills that like our Talent acquisition team built. And they, so they wanted us part of the manager development programs. So any new managers would be auto assigned it. But they also wanted all managers just to take it like across the board.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Miranda and Amy discussed a notification issue related to global companies, which could potentially be due to system downtime.\n• Amy described the Learning Plan feature request for an incomplete learning plan notification and how it relates to a manager development program with six or seven courses, including one called interviewing skills that was added recently. END"}
{"prompt":"AMY\n22:46 \nSo we added to the learning plan and I enrolled all the managers in the company into the course itself, not the learning plan, just the course. And it's becoming a problem all of a sudden that like employee managers, I should say managers who are not new, who have been here for years and we're just enrolled in interviewing skills, are getting manager development program Notifications but are not enrolled in the manager. Like if you go in the back end, look at manager development program, they're not enrolled in it, but they're getting the notification. And so.\nGREGORY\n23:20 \nSo, it's like unique course that learning plan.\nAMY\n23:22 \nEmitted a ticket. And they were saying, if they were basically like, yes, expected behavior again, if a course is in alert, like they basically, I don't even know exactly word for word what they said, but they are basically like, yeah, yeah, that's expected behavior which… I guess you were trying to get a grasp on like why is it set up that way? Like.\nMIRANDA\n23:47 \nYeah, you.\nAMY\n23:48 \nProbably set it up that way for a reason. We can't figure out why.\nMIRANDA\n23:52 \nYeah.\nAMY\n23:52 \nThey like the only thing we can think of is to create a separate course, but that gets like messy when it comes to reporting.\nGREGORY\n23:59 \nLike the learning plan only course. And then there's the like separate, yeah, yeah.\nLearning Plans ends\nAMY\n24:03 \nA lot of manual to like separate that at this together into one. So like we weren't really able to get a good grasp from the person we were working with on like functionality wise, why it was, I.\nGREGORY\n24:21 \nYeah. Maybe we're using the notification in a weird way.\nAMY\n24:24 \nThat like a manager takes let's say the, a manager is really interested in gaining more skills around feedback.\nLearning Plans\nAMY\n24:32 \nLike we would expect them to just go take the feedback course without necessarily being enrolled in the manager development program. And I would assume that's like similar in other companies like that, you can take a course that's a part of the learning plan with the learning plan. So, I'm not like, I don't know if it's through that, that's expected functionality because it doesn't make sense to us.\nNotifications\nAMY\n24:55 \nBut if that is expected functionality, like why is that? Like, yeah, like should we be using that notification differently? Is there a different notification we should be using for this purpose so that we can keep it as one course. Like we weren't able, those insights from the person we were working with. Okay? Like this is one of the ones that like we've been getting a lot of tickets lately about.\nNotifications ends\nMIRANDA\n25:21 \nOkay. Internally to you. Okay. Yeah, if you want to send me that ticket as well, just like, you know, I'm curious now too.\nGREGORY\n25:31 \nYeah. Yeah. I think it was part of the time zone one. So that might be a good one to send out like it was like both of those problems.\nNotifications\nGREGORY\n25:38 \nNot only were they not in the manager plan, and so they got that, but they also got it on the wrong date. So it was like a, is a good example.\nMIRANDA\n25:46 \nYeah, cause are you supposed to duplicate every course that just doesn't seem?\nAMY\n25:53 \nSend you like some of the, I don't know if it would help like if we sent some of the names?\nMIRANDA\n25:58 \nYeah.\nAMY\n26:00 \nComplaining about it, because like, and they're getting, they're like what tenure have you been here for so long? Why am I getting this notification?\nMIRANDA\n26:07 \nYeah, it's also.\nAMY\n26:08 \nWeird because they're not enrolled in the like, if you look on the back end, they're not enrolled in the program, and we have that notification sent to only send to like people in the learning plan. Obviously. So that's why I'm just confused.\nLearning Plans\nGREGORY\n26:24 \nWell, I think it's like there wasn't a learning, this learning plan is a complete option like here are the remaining. So we kinda had to do our own thing there. It looks like I don't know.\nMIRANDA\n26:34 \nYeah.\nGREGORY\n26:34 \nRight there. That wasn't an option that existed yet or something. But yeah, I don't know.\nLearning Plans ends\nMIRANDA\n26:41 \nYeah, those are, I know, I wish I had like the exact responses off the top of my head.\nAMY\n26:45 \nThat's…\nMIRANDA\n26:46 \nOkay. I don't know.\nAMY\n26:48 \nIt's…\nGREGORY\n26:49 \nThe whole thing, it's like, I don't know.\nAMY\n26:52 \nSo, we're like we need help getting through the answer.\nMIRANDA\n26:55 \nYeah. Well, I appreciate that. You have a strong desire to understand the why behind some in. So that like you said, so you're like should we be using this differently? Like, is there something, you know? And look, I know that cat said when we met like that, you do use the platform a little non traditionally in some senses too, which is great also because, you know, you're being creative and using it.\nAMY\n27:17 \nYeah.\nMIRANDA\n27:17 \nAnd I…\nAMY\n27:18 \nForget what it's called, but we were like, so you could probably check on this on your end, but like we were supposed to be like included in some product group on side like once they were ready for like new voices to come in like for the last two years, we've been told like, yeah, yeah, you're going to be on it and we've been like so excited about it, but then we never heard anything about it like, no, no, no, don't worry. You're still on the list?\nMIRANDA\n27:45 \nWas that from Adam barlhousen?\nAMY\n27:47 \nNo. So, initially vide, like with our customer?\nMIRANDA\n27:50 \nOkay.\nAMY\n27:51 \nAnd then like she put us on the list. And then like Rob and Mike, we're like, yeah, yeah, you're still on the list, but it was for like some, I forgot you like talked about it at inspire like some product group, but like you pick googles into it.\nMIRANDA\n28:09 \nOkay. I'll ask vide.\nAMY\n28:11 \nI…\nMIRANDA\n28:11 \nI, what that was. She'll remember, she's got a great memory and because you still want to be, you're eager to.\nAMY\n28:17 \nReally want to… talk about it. We're like we're really? Yeah.\nMIRANDA\n28:25 \nOkay.\nAMY\n28:26 \nSelling point for us. Let me tell you.\nMIRANDA\n28:28 \nCool. I love that you wanna give feedback. I think that's awesome. Yeah. Let me see if I can push that along somehow nudge some folks, yeah, Adam.\nAMY\n28:38 \nTechnical things are.\nMIRANDA\n28:40 \nYeah, please let.\nGREGORY\n28:43 \nYeah, let's see after that Slack integration, which is, I was just, I was just like looking into that because I was curious after Amy mentioned it and…\nAMY\n28:52 \nYou send it up just so, you know, back in like 2021 early 22. So, it's been there for like a year. We just haven't been able too.\nNotifications\nGREGORY\n29:01 \nYeah. And it's weird. Yeah, like it says it's set up on the CEO in it says configuration done green text, all happy, you know, then we try to create a notification, you know, with that Slack additional Slack. So it's like email and Slack and it doesn't seem to go out to like the quick test.\nNotifications ends\nGREGORY\n29:24 \nI did. I like, did a ILT sign up notification? Then I signed up for our ILT course. And then nothing sounds like, okay, that's weird on top of that, it's like when we synchronize the users, it's only getting like 600 or so which is like definitely not enough. So, like we might think that's the issue. But then on top of that, I was looking through our like our Slack apps for the workplace for TripAdvisor and Docebo is not even been approved on there. So, I'm like what?\nMIRANDA\n29:54 \nLike…\nAMY\n29:55 \nMark both sides of the, because I know I had submitted a ticket a long time ago… and they had said like everything looked okay, or maybe Rob had even looked at it. Maybe it wasn't a ticket. Maybe Rob had just looked on, somebody had looked at it and then like it all looks right?\nMIRANDA\n30:12 \nYeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Amy and Gregory discussed the issue of managers receiving notifications for courses they are not enrolled in, which is causing confusion.\n• They considered creating a separate course to address the problem but found it would be too difficult to report on. \n• Miranda suggested sending her some names of people who have been complaining about this issue as well as details from an earlier ticket Amy had submitted regarding Slack integration with Docebo that was not approved yet. END"}
{"prompt":"AMY\n30:13 \nSo…\nGREGORY\n30:13 \nThat might, we might need to like follow through with. Is it Rob who you would talk to?\nAMY\n30:17 \nBut he's not here anymore.\nGREGORY\n30:20 \nBut I, yeah, that's the gate.\nMIRANDA\n30:22 \nYeah, but you did submit a ticket?\nGREGORY\n30:27 \nThat's I thought you're talking about the right? Okay.\nAMY\n30:29 \nNo, no, it was Duncan on our side. Yeah. So I guess we're just not sure which side the issues on like do we, whose problem it is so to fix? I also like one thing that came up while I was looking at it is I noticed that in Slack, it comes up as Docebo. Like as, you know, the app is.\nMIRANDA\n30:50 \nYeah.\nAMY\n30:51 \nI'm curious and like again, you don't need to have an answer right now, but I'm curious if there's been any other companies to like internally call it something different and how…\nMIRANDA\n31:01 \nWork.\nAMY\n31:02 \nThat, because if something comes from their team, nobody's gonna know what?\nMIRANDA\n31:05 \nNo, they want. They understand learning cloud is.\nAMY\n31:08 \nYeah. So I wasn't sure. Like if there's any workarounds like other companies?\nMIRANDA\n31:13 \nYeah. Yeah. Can you white label that notification? Good question. I don't know. I'll find out.\nGREGORY\n31:19 \nI'm gonna do some investigating on our side now too to see like what happened to it and like how, yeah.\nMIRANDA\n31:26 \nYeah, because if it hasn't been syncing properly and in Slack isn't showing it as a partner?\nAMY\n31:34 \nWe'll talk to our team to get it added to Slack like, I know that on our side, but I'm not sure about the 600 users thing since fully integrated.\nMIRANDA\n31:43 \nYeah. So if a ticket hasn't been submitted for that, then that, it would be great if you could submit just for the syncing issue while you're looking into the other things. And then the one that I'll take with me is, can you white label that Notifications, it doesn't show us to and I'll follow up with you with that?\nGREGORY\n32:01 \nI'd be great. Yeah, because it might even if we can't we might just be like me, no, yeah.\nMIRANDA\n32:07 \nYeah. And…\nGREGORY\n32:07 \nI…\nMIRANDA\n32:08 \nExplain to your team but I'll see if I'll see, I'll check into that. Yeah.\nAMY\n32:13 \nThen I think the last thing which is the easiest is we just want to change the unique identifier from email address to employee ID. It was like super easy. He was like, but I would just, he basically said he would at the time like do it with us, just and like test a couple of users, make sure we were good to go. So if there's somebody on like your team who could do that and help us with that?\nMIRANDA\n32:40 \nYou wanna change it to employee ID? Is that what you just said? Okay, change the unique ID from email address to employee ID? Okay? So what I think we should do for that is, yeah, we'll set up another call and then, yeah, I'll bring in any technical resources I need. I'll just do some research before and try to figure that out. Yeah.\nAMY\n33:01 \nAlready a field on our file is coming in. So off set to do it, but it's like right now email addresses do change. I don't say frequently, but do change whenever someone marries divorces, like we have some subsidiaries that go have like their own and the TripAdvisor email and we're like having to merge on the back end. So employee ID is like the one.\nMIRANDA\n33:26 \nThat's Workday that it's coming from?\nAMY\n33:28 \nYeah. In the SF to people there.\nMIRANDA\n33:32 \nOkay. Okay. Cool. I'll take that one with me and we'll get some time in the box for that. Yeah. Yeah, it's been, we're looking about probably two weeks out right now.\nAMY\n33:46 \nOkay. That's fine. Listen, we've got like almost two years with it as it is, so we can go a couple more weeks or months if need.\nGREGORY\n33:54 \nThis is our just like backlog right? If.\nMIRANDA\n34:00 \nOkay. And then I know we're over time. Sorry about that.\nAMY\n34:05 \nI'll send you the ticket, the notification tickets. We'll submit a ticket about Slack for the merging. Should we CC you on that or just send it to you if the problem is not solved?\nMIRANDA\n34:19 \nYeah, just, yeah, you don't need to see me on that, just send it and if for some reason it needs to hit escalation, hit me up and we'll talk about that or if you're getting like confused by the ticket, then I'll step in there too. And then the other, the things that I hit throw in the chat there and I'll email them to you as well, just so they're not just here, is there's a status page?\nAMY\n34:45 \nThat was helpful.\nMIRANDA\n34:46 \nOut.\nAMY\n34:47 \nI see that.\nMIRANDA\n34:48 \nWell, there you go.\nGREGORY\n34:50 \nMarket…\nMIRANDA\n34:52 \nOkay. And then the community is a known issues page that you can subscribe to.\nGREGORY\n34:57 \nYeah, that's…\nAMY\n34:59 \nThat's the one. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's what we need. Okay?\nMIRANDA\n35:02 \nYeah. So that'll be super helpful. The status page is great, but sometimes I'm like looking at it and I'm like, okay, everything's operational. So I'm not sure. Yeah, but I think the known issues page is going to be really useful to you. I mean, that is for like the status pages like system wide outages, if you're things aren't working, then you can be like, okay, I see there's an issue happening in, you know, whatever this part of the platform in this region, so.\nWrap-Up\nGREGORY\n35:32 \nI just subscribed.\nMIRANDA\n35:35 \nHey, cool. Well, I'll email you those links as well. We'll follow up with little recap, and then we'll get something scheduled for… the, you changing the unique identifier lost it for a second.\nGREGORY\n35:50 \nYeah, yeah, cool. You.\nMIRANDA\n35:53 \nThank you. So.\nAMY\n35:54 \nMuch hope you have a good weekend.\nMIRANDA\n35:56 \nYou too.\nGREGORY\n35:57 \nYeah, yeah. You too. Bye have a good weekend.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Miranda suggested submitting a ticket to investigate the syncing issue and asked if it was possible to white label notifications from Docebo.\n• Amy mentioned that emails can change due to certain circumstances, so they wanted to switch their unique identifier from email address to employee ID instead. \n• Miranda offered her help in researching this solution as well as providing links for a status page and known issues page for reference purposes.

{"prompt":"GABRIELLE\n0:00 \nHey, Emily, how's it going? All right? Thanks. How are… you? Look different with your?\nEMILY\n0:06 \nIs on, I'm only wearing them because I've discovered I stare at computer screens too much and… so they're like the billers, white ones.\nGABRIELLE\n0:16 \nYeah. In the evening, in the evening, I watch from I swat from like work screen to other screen.\nEMILY\n0:22 \nGreen screen.\nGABRIELLE\n0:25 \nYeah, it's like from bad screen to good screen and always screens always screen. Well, last year, I just got back into reading in like a big way but in a way that's like still bad on my eyes because I'm still like focusing. I wear glasses anyway, obviously.\nSmall Talk ends\nEMILY\n0:42 \nMy problem is because I've got kindle. So I read on a screen.\nGABRIELLE\n0:46 \nYeah, I'm not a kindle convert. I just love of a book but my partner is starting to get annoyed with how many books we have. He's like we're going to need like a separate room just for books? Like that. Sounds fine to me like that sounds reasonable?\nEMILY\n1:00 \nYeah. I mean, because I've got flat mate, so I can't really like spread out the books. I had to make an executive decision which was to get in.\nGABRIELLE\n1:10 \nThe kinda, yeah, I guess if you really enjoy a book on the Kendall and you do want to like have a copy to keep, you can always buy a hard copy.\nEMILY\n1:20 \nYeah, but I mean, I…\nGABRIELLE\n1:22 \nThen it's like I'd probably end up buying a hard copy of every book. When did the end? Hey, Sylvia, how are you? Hey Sarah?\nSARAH\n1:31 \nHi there.\nSILVIA\n1:32 \nHello?\nGABRIELLE\n1:33 \nGuys. How's it going?\nSARAH\n1:35 \nGoing well, thank you.\nGABRIELLE\n1:38 \nVery good. Cool. Well, obviously… yeah, happy to facilitate another one of the sessions for you guys.\nEMILY\n1:47 \nGive you a chance.\nGABRIELLE\n1:49 \nYou ask any more questions that you have only been playing around for a while. So, so, yeah, anything following on from earlier in the week, but obviously anything new as well? The floor is yours?\nSARAH\n2:01 \nBrilliant. Thank you very much. So, we've got, we've just sort of run through what we're going to talk about in the demo and we've got a couple of other questions that… come from that rehearsal and we want to just make sure that we can cover them up.\nUser Permission\nSARAH\n2:22 \nSo I'm gonna start. So within the, my team section, there's an option for a manager to add people into their team, you know, so of using to your team buttons or remove from your team buttons that's going to be centrally run… by our HR system. So, is it possible to switch that off so that people don't see that?\nUser Permission ends\nSILVIA\n2:50 \nDon't see, you mean the button where they add people to their teams, that, what you mean? Sarah? Yeah. All right. Let me just go ahead and check what exact button you're referring to. I got plenty of managers or if you can probably share your screen, that be better.\nSARAH\n3:12 \nI was sorry, I was in some.\nSILVIA\n3:19 \nJust trying to retrieve the original manager, but I guess.\nSARAH\n3:25 \nOkay. Here we go.\nSILVIA\n3:25 \nHappen some changes around here.\nSARAH\n3:34 \nOkay. Can you see my screen? Yes. Okay. So up here, if you click on the, if you click on there, you can add a team member. So we'd like that disabled if possible. And also within here, there's also the removed from team options.\nSILVIA\n3:54 \nAll right. Let me just because if we can't do that through functionalities, we can definitely hide that with the CSS. So remove from my team button. I'm gonna have to check. Unfortunately, I don't have an answer for you now. I can come back after this.\nSARAH\n4:13 \nOkay. That's brilliant. So, and the other one was with the skills dialogue. So while I'm here, I might as well just stay in here.\nEMILY\n4:25 \nYup.\nSARAH\n4:28 \nCan't see it when I can't see it under angels? I don't think. Yeah, it was the skills dialogue. I'm just wondering. Is that configurable out of the box?\nAbout Docebo\nSARAH\n4:40 \nBecause right now it's showing some job roles et cetera. That we wouldn't have. So I'm just wondering. So for example, if we had say an analyst, you know, instead of what we do have, we use it consultant travel, consultant, cat, we would have something like analyst… consultant, senior consultant, partner, director?\nAbout Docebo ends\nSARAH\n5:09 \nI'm just wondering, would it be possible to configure those and map the skills related to each job role, sort of when we're doing the, when we, when we're doing implementation or is there any way we can sort of dummy that up right now?\nSILVIA\n5:26 \nYes. So if you log in as an admin, you can group those skills together in a skills management. Have you looked at that or?\nUser Permission\nSARAH\n5:35 \nA quick look… I'm logged in as Baringa at the moment. Let me just log in a super admin.\nEMILY\n5:49 \nSo I can see like admin skills team like.\nSILVIA\n5:52 \nManagement?\nEMILY\n5:52 \nYeah, IT a.\nSILVIA\n5:55 \nAnd there you go. Yeah. And here you can see that you can group skills together. You can add new ones and make them available to the Branches into groups in your organization.\nUser Permission ends\nSILVIA\n6:08 \nThat means they're not going to be able to choose something that you haven't put at their disposal. They're limited to 11 skills. In the case of leadership. See, we've got one Branches in one group, seeing only 11 skills and those can be from our library and also mixed with what you create yourself in the plus button, your own. Yeah.\nSARAH\n6:32 \nOkay. Sorry, I'm switching between screens and just write at the moment.\nSILVIA\n6:37 \nNo worries.\nEMILY\n6:38 \nHow do we add in the job titles though? Because I mean, that obviously does deal with the skills, but like you've got preset job titles which aren't relevant to us. So I don't know what, how we force our own job titles and that.\nBranches & Groups\nSILVIA\n6:52 \nYou can't add to job titles in the platform, but that would be something that we manage through additional fields. That means that job title field can come from your HR tool essentially, and we use those to group people together with Automation rules. We talked about that in the last session… and then associate these skills to the groups and Branches. Once we populate them with those additional fields, okay?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Sarah asked if there is an option to switch off the ability to add people into teams centrally run by HR system as well as configuring skills dialogue with job roles they don't have. \n• Silvia explained how admins can group skills together in Skills Management and use Automation Rules to associate these skills with groups/branches through additional fields from their HR tool. END"}
{"prompt":"SARAH\n7:26 \nCan you, can you associate the level of skill as well? So an analyst perhaps might be a beginner in stakeholder management, but a partner would be an expert.\nSILVIA\n7:42 \nThat, that is a little bit tricky because as of now, as we said, we're still working on those levels. So they're there, but they don't do anything really.\nBranches & Groups\nSILVIA\n7:52 \nIt's just for you to keep track on the different levels. Our suggestions in that case will be to still use the groups in the Branches, then level one, level two, level three of analysts. Because essentially people can sit in two groups, one analyst and the other one beginners, for example, still related to analysts and that would give them visibility maybe to more things in the platform or you can automate a lot more then I'm completing the beginner training.\nBranches & Groups ends\nSILVIA\n8:19 \nAnd then as a second step, I'll go to advanced and it'll be put automatically in the advanced group. So play more with the groups rather than those levels as of now.\nSARAH\n8:30 \nYes.\nSILVIA\n8:31 \nAgain, this is part of how.\nSARAH\n8:32 \nOkay.\nEMILY\n8:33 \nBe growing.\nSILVIA\n8:33 \nIn the future? Yes.\nSARAH\n8:35 \nYeah. Do you know if in the future we might be able to edit those levels and configure those for ourselves because we have slightly different vocabulary around, you know, we tend not to use beginner intermediate advanced. Do you know if we'll be able to edit those?\nSILVIA\n8:54 \nYes, those are editable. And once again still mentioning the CSS part, not only those levels but also different areas of the platform. If there's a certain word that you want to change, you've got a localization tool in there where you can call it. I don't know you don't like learning plans.\nBranches & Groups\nSILVIA\n9:14 \nYou want it to be called journey. You can go ahead and change that throughout the whole platform so that you have your own language.\nSARAH\n9:21 \nOkay, brilliant. So the way I understand it is we can't edit the job titles right now. Well, well, sorry, we can edit the job titles through additional fields, but we'd have to use Automation to group them together. So for the purposes of the demonstration, we couldn't edit the job titles. So we'd only see… analyst advisor coming up. Okay. And as for the levels, we can't edit those in future and we can't really group people by those in future… as they stand within the skills overview, but we might be able, you know, we might be able to do that in the future. Is that correct?\nBranches & Groups ends\nSILVIA\n10:13 \nI cannot guarantee what the feature is gonna look like. Unfortunately, it's something that again, as a full feature, we're looking at it and it's under consideration. We've got as well. Some marketing research is going on right now on what exactly we're going to be doing with the skills as it is.\nBranches & Groups\nSILVIA\n10:35 \nNow, my suggestion would be to leverage as much as you can, those groups and the Automation so that you don't manually change things as you go. So what I would say here is that fine, those levels can be probably again achieved with the groups. But when it comes to skills, those are going to be attached to the courses as in what does it take? For? I don't know an analyst that is a beginner to do in order to become advanced and you three courses associated to beginners and three others that are associated to advanced and leverage those additional fields to group them together as they complete courses. And they can be automatically as well put in the next group.\nBranches & Groups ends\nSILVIA\n11:27 \nWhat's the next step? This is how it would work as it is now. Unfortunately, I don't have any visibility on the future again, something that is quite small and that we do not excel at the moment.\nSARAH\n11:41 \nOkay. That's fine. My next question is the local coach, can we figure that? So can we sort of program it to answer for, you know? So can we program it to sort of answer specific questions? Like if I was to say, how do I calculate training points which is a particularly during a specific thing? Can we, how does that work?\nSILVIA\n12:14 \nWell… there's really nothing you can do to control the virtual coach. The only thing or what would it pick up most more than anything would be those tags that you add on your content as in the topic related content, those tags that you're adding are contributing to the artificial intelligence engine. And those are going to be again fed within the recommended content when the learners are using it, but it doesn't really focus on in any assist in functionalities or operations. It works on the progress as well as questions related to the content in the platform. So it's more like improving the experience of the learner more than anything.\nSARAH\n13:03 \nSo it's yeah. So it's basically learning as it goes on. Okay?\nSILVIA\n13:06 \nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nSARAH\n13:08 \nOkay. Brilliant. And these are going to go all over the place. I'm afraid. So with the, my activity widget, so let's go, dashboard, user management.\nSARAH\n13:41 \nSo here, is it possible to edit and change these titles here? I can see we can change the order because I've changed the order on them, but I'm just wondering, can we change the titles at all?\nSILVIA\n13:57 \nRight. I got this question from Gabby and unfortunately, not in those widgets, we can't really overwrite CSS because it's not part of the platform is just a piece of code that we would add, just blocks that we would add. So that widgets is standard. But if you'd let us know what you're trying to achieve. Maybe we can, I don't know invent something else that would match your wording is that the main thing that you have in mind to change the status or?\nSARAH\n14:31 \nYeah, it's really just to change it's.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Sarah asked if it was possible to edit and change the job titles in the Branches & Groups feature, but Silvia informed her that it wasn't currently possible. \n• She suggested leveraging Automation and groups instead of levels for visibility into more things within the platform. \n• Lastly, Sarah inquired about changing widget titles in User Management; however Silvia explained that they weren't able to overwrite CSS code on widgets at present time but offered a potential solution depending on what she wanted achieve with her wording changes. END"}
{"prompt":"SARAH\n14:33 \nReally just to change the, you know, sort of because in progress and not started a fine. ILT doesn't mean anything to anybody here… and… deadlines. I don't know, Emily, what do you think about deadlines?\nEMILY\n14:55 \nI don't think they'll like it in a learning context?\nSARAH\n14:58 \nNo.\nEMILY\n14:58 \nHave deadlines at work. I think in learning context, it creates panic for our consultants.\nCertifications ends\nSILVIA\n15:09 \nLet me just go ahead and see if I can show you some other alternatives that we can have. Just go ahead and do this from.\nGABRIELLE\n15:20 \nHere.\nSILVIA\n15:22 \nOnboarding Inbox, there you go.\nSARAH\n15:26 \nDo…\nSILVIA\n15:27 \nYou have or you can go to, well, okay. I'll share. I took another platform because I'm not sure if I can find it in that one. So this is again, another way of displaying those not yet started in progress, completed in deadlines by displaying just the widget without those things on top.\nSARAH\n15:51 \nOkay.\nSILVIA\n15:52 \nThat you wanna change and these can be named however you want. Then you can call this. There is still a road to go or whatever you wanna put your own words in here and add these on the homepage of the learner, if you want to, in the Shape of widgets at the bottom of the page or however you want to. So this is again.\nSARAH\n16:16 \nYeah. So that's that top one is one row and that's just content that's content isn't it that's…\nSILVIA\n16:24 \nYeah.\nSARAH\n16:25 \nThat's a title with an image, isn't it?\nSILVIA\n16:28 \nLet me show you how it looks like on the admin side, just using the onboarding page… on. So within the composer, you'd have an HTM, you can type here whatever you want.\nSARAH\n16:49 \nOkay.\nSILVIA\n16:49 \nHello, save changes. And then when I go to the top review, it changes, right? And underneath on the not yet started, you would have the courses and learning plans where the seat is not started.\nSARAH\n17:06 \nYeah. Get it.\nEMILY\n17:11 \nThat, the widget is, we can't configure it different that's just how it runs.\nSILVIA\n17:16 \nWhich one the one that you showed me? Yes, that's that standard. Thank you.\nSARAH\n17:23 \nOkay. Thank you for that. Okay? So another thing we've got this. I think we've talked about this, Gabby, a lot, which is the training points… and we've created an extra field in the user in the user account to show how many training points a person has. But we can't seem to get to a display on my, you can't seem to get to display extra fields on my profile. So I'm wondering if that's possible if we're just doing something wrong?\nSILVIA\n18:08 \nIn additional fields on a user, is that it? Yeah, on the learner… usually, it is possible to display them in his profile as long as those fields are visible… to the user, let me just go ahead and see. Okay. So what you're looking to achieve is to have them in here… is that?\nSARAH\n18:47 \nYeah. So that training points?\nSILVIA\n18:52 \nYeah.\nSARAH\n18:52 \nSo, so we give everybody 10 training points at the beginning of the year. So when that person looks at my profile, they should be able to see.\nUser Permission\nSILVIA\n19:04 \nYep. Well, you got it. As in, I can.\nSARAH\n19:07 \nSee it? Yeah.\nSILVIA\n19:08 \nHere, is there any other behavior you want?\nSARAH\n19:13 \nHow does that display in my profile though? I mean, for the, not from the admin from the user point of view?\nSILVIA\n19:21 \nIt's it's gonna be the same essentially for every user as long as this field when you created is visible to the users, I think.\nUser Permission ends\nEMILY\n19:30 \nThe widget?\nSARAH\n19:32 \nYeah. How do we do? How do we do it in the widget?\nSILVIA\n19:35 \nSo, this one over here, you got mandatory field. And as long as it's invisible, it's not going to be seen by the user. If it's not, again, if you tick this box, the user is not gonna see it in the profile. If it is, then he sees it. So it should be there now.\nSARAH\n19:52 \nOkay. Let me check… which one was that?\nSILVIA\n19:59 \nA training point?\nEMILY\n20:01 \nBecause we're talking about that like mini widget that's you can put up, which is your profile widget, right?\nSILVIA\n20:10 \nOkay. So you're referring?\nEMILY\n20:12 \nWe want, so they don't have to go search for it. They just go to what we've called their profile and it pops up on that, which.\nSARAH\n20:21 \nLet me just.\nEMILY\n20:24 \nSo, we've made a little profile page, which is the learner homepage that you originally made, I believe?\nSILVIA\n20:32 \nOkay. So if I log in as a learner… this would be the page that you've created a profile. Is it this one over?\nSARAH\n20:46 \nYeah, yeah, which.\nEMILY\n20:47 \nIsn't showing anything at the moment?\nSILVIA\n20:51 \nOkay. If I switch back, that would be the learner home page.\nSILVIA\n21:01 \nHome? Is that it? Maybe? Yes, this should be the one. So in here… you've got the fields you want to display?\nSARAH\n21:14 \nExcellent. So.\nSILVIA\n21:17 \nNow, they should show up there. You go cool.\nSARAH\n21:22 \nBrilliant.\nEMILY\n21:24 \nCould you save that just so we can?\nSARAH\n21:26 \nCan copy it done. Thank you.\nEMILY\n21:30 \nIs Sarah?\nSARAH\n21:32 \nYeah, it's fair.\nSILVIA\n21:33 \nIt's great problem.\nSARAH\n21:35 \nThat is one of our biggest problems just solved. Thank you so much.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Sarah and Emily discussed ILT, deadlines, and training points in a learning context. \n• Sarah asked about displaying additional fields on user profiles to show training points earned throughout the year. \n• Silvia provided instructions for making sure those fields were visible to users so they could be displayed in their profile widget. END"}
{"prompt":"EMILY\n21:40 \nIn regards to that additional field, though, are we able to automate the number changing or is that a manual process?\nSILVIA\n21:50 \nYou could automated but not functionally speaking is in, I don't know, I'm gonna give you an example.\nIntegrations\nSILVIA\n21:57 \nIf I complete three courses, I want the points to change or that feels to be a certain value. Those are things that you can automate via APIs or use our to connect with only a connection where you can create different workflows in the platform. When something happens, then do something else and put that in place and it can be accessed. Again. Docebo connect is something that we add here. It is an extra, an additional tool that would allow you to create those workflows. It is a little bit technical. It's true. But once you have those workflows, they're going to be yours and you can control them as.\nEMILY\n22:41 \nThat's that's one of our big things. So I have no doubt that even if it's technical, we're going to go that.\nIntegrations ends\nSARAH\n22:48 \nWe, we will have to do that.\nSILVIA\n22:52 \nTechnical person. And I was still able to create an Automation between Docebo and an excel file. It might sound silly. But whenever you add a new course in Docebo, then we're going to add a new role in an excel on Gmail. And all the way around, if I add a role in excel, then of course, gets created in Docebo again, it might sound simple, but it's something that again, for me, it's something that again is not rocket science as long as you learn how to do it… that's cool. Yeah, for consideration maybe for the future. And it could work as well with other tools. And here, we talked a lot about Automation with an HR tool if you got your skills elsewhere if you want to import them or things that you might want to change into cable, coming from other systems, like a job role or level that can essentially come from the HR and then assign those courses to the learners accordingly.\nUser Permission\nSILVIA\n23:54 \nSo that's also something that we could consider maybe or you can consider for the future. If you have something specific in mind, it's not sick, just want scenario.\nSARAH\n24:04 \nOkay. Then we were looking at the reporting, so.\nSILVIA\n24:11 \nI wanted to bring that up.\nSARAH\n24:14 \nAll good. Yeah. So we were wondering if, you know, if we can, we create reports at the Power report templates that the Power users can run.\nCustom Reports\nSARAH\n24:22 \nSo we're back on training points again. So if I'm a manager and I want to work out how many training points each team member has left… could they create a report that they could run from my team?\nSILVIA\n24:42 \nFrom my team… you've got the, my activities that you can see, but you can access the reporting hub at any point and look at those, that additional field that you've added.\nUser Permission\nSILVIA\n24:59 \nI would say yes, but maybe not from my team. Is that log in as a Power user? Let me just go ahead and see it. Because the reason why I'm saying this is because my team does not have that reporting piece. And here probably there go manage.\nSARAH\n25:18 \nYeah. So.\nCustom Reports\nSILVIA\n25:18 \nYou can go ahead and probably user summary report.\nSARAH\n25:22 \nYeah.\nSILVIA\n25:23 \nThis, this is the one that you can run from here and it gives you all the details around a particular user, right? Total time. The standard, this unfortunately cannot be modified but.\nSARAH\n25:36 \nYou…\nSILVIA\n25:37 \nCan go and reporting essentially as a manager.\nEMILY\n25:41 \nWhat the reports wasn't there at the top of my.\nSARAH\n25:43 \nYeah. I was just wondering about the reports tab… this one, that one there. So what would be really nice if we could have the report template in there which actually just says report users or, yeah, your teams learning training points and then we could run a training, you know, they can see how many training points they have left.\nSILVIA\n26:08 \nWell, let me just check on that because I know you can do this in reporting but not in my team. So how many training points in my team, right?\nSARAH\n26:21 \nSo really it's just so you know, if we created a, you know, if we created a template for a report, could we make that available to a Power user through the reports tab or in a?\nCustom Reports ends\nSILVIA\n26:35 \nI can check if we can display that to them in here because once again, you can do this within the… or you can link, I would say a button to them where they can be redirected to that particular report if you want to. But for my team, I'm gonna have to invest.\nSARAH\n26:54 \nOkay. Thank you very much.\nEMILY\n26:56 \nAnd we can let people who on in a team. So if we're instead of saying my team, I'm a manager, I want details about the people blow me if we're saying someone like a learning champ, Sarah, who obviously that team and might be trying to get information about people who are above them as well.\nCustom Reports\nSARAH\n27:14 \nWe…\nEMILY\n27:15 \nCan do that via the reporting function. Is that correct? As long as they're a Power user? Okay? That's fine. One other thing I did, I just want to check the reports. Are we able to run a report to see active users on like a monthly or weekly basis or whatever?\nPricing\nEMILY\n27:32 \nBecause I can't quite seem to figure out how to go and see who is accessing our platform on or how many people are accessing our platform on a second.\nSILVIA\n27:40 \nI don't think you can in a trial platform.\nEMILY\n27:43 \nBut you can.\nSILVIA\n27:44 \nWell, yeah, in a production environment, you'll have a counter at the top of the page as well as Notifications when you reach a certain quota plus a team behind that's, gonna ask you if you want to upgrade. So you're definitely not gonna miss your numbers in there.\nEMILY\n28:01 \nIt, it was more because we want to compare the amount of people who are say accessing to CEO and the amount of times they're accessing it in say a month or every fortnight and compare it to what we've got from Cornerstone at the moment because obviously, we're gonna need to, we're really cool guys… definitely.\nPricing ends\nSARAH\n28:20 \nOkay. And I'll put two more and then it's Emily's turn.\nEMILY\n28:28 \nAsking a lot of my questions as well. So we're…\nSARAH\n28:30 \nNow, this was the one that was asked in the demo and I'm not sure if I actually got it down properly, Emily. So please jump in and it was around the number of approving the amazing number of improvements that you've released in the past year… and is that going to carry on this year… because?\nEMILY\n28:50 \nOn the 2023 road map?\nSARAH\n28:52 \nYeah.\nSILVIA\n28:53 \nThat's that's actually a good question. I can't remember if you guys were in the roadmap presentation. I think it was.\nGABRIELLE\n29:00 \nIt was just a, so we ran, I'm not sure if you caught up with Sarah at all, but we ran a roadmap session with Sarah on Monday. It's a tricky business because lots of it is very secretive. We don't record.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily and Silvia discussed automating the number changing process, as well as creating custom reports in order to view team members' training points.\n• Sarah asked if Power users could create report templates from the 'Reports' tab. Silvia suggested linking a button for them to be redirected to that particular report instead. \n• Emily inquired about running a report on active monthly/weekly users and pricing information related to this feature was mentioned.  END"}
{"prompt":"SARAH\n29:12 \nThe…\nGABRIELLE\n29:13 \nCalls and we talk about road map and we don't really share anything visual either simply because our road map is evolving all the time because we're listening to customer feedback. We're listening to what prospects are telling us on demos before we've even signed them as a customer. Or maybe we never do. We're listening to what our competitors are doing, what the market is saying, et cetera. So we might have one feature internally slated for a Q1 release. But then something else comes up and we decide that's more of a priority. We push the other thing to Q3. So things kinda move around a little bit. So we talked with Sarah in a kind of abstract sense about some of the things that we'll be working on this year. And I think she made some notes. So you can always catch up with her if you want to kinda cross check what kinds of things you're thinking about. We can't really give any specifics or like specific timelines. But what I can say is from an investment piece, where will they'll be no slowing down on the Docebo side and how often and how much we make investments basically in the tool and in the product. We're I know it's a tricky landscape for a lot of tech companies at the moment.\nPricing\nGABRIELLE\n30:26 \nI'm sure every time you open LinkedIn, you see there are more layoffs, more companies are making layoffs, we have no intention of making any layoffs. We have, we're actually hiring. So we're hiring pretty aggressively. We have something like 242 150 people in our product team.\nPricing ends\nGABRIELLE\n30:46 \nYou know, we're a 900 person organization which means that we're able to make those investments in the product and we're able to stay in it as well. Like what, you know, what's out there. And realistically, it means that we're able too say a lot more agile than maybe some of our competitors… you know, in this particular context, obviously, I know it's us versus Learnupon and Learnupon is a great tool as well like they're you know, they have a great tool, a great LMS with some good features. Obviously they do. Otherwise, you wouldn't be still, you know, having them in consideration for like comparison.\nPricing\nGABRIELLE\n31:25 \nThey're about 130 people overall and they've also just laid off nine percent, which obviously isn't a huge number when you're only 130 people anyway. But the reason I mentioned it is because, you know, with 240, 250.\nPricing ends\nGABRIELLE\n31:39 \nPeople in our product team, it means we're really able to listen to our customer feedback and continue to make investments in the product. So what I'd say is if you've seen the 2022 road map, you can expect a similar quantity of.\nSARAH\n31:54 \nAnd…\nGABRIELLE\n31:54 \nThings in 2023 and beyond as well. We've no intention of slowing down there. Okay. I don't know if you'd add anything on onto that Sylvia.\nUser Permission\nSILVIA\n32:05 \nI mean into specifics, we talked a lot about improving the quality life for super admins as well as increasing the autonomy for the Power users. So whenever we're talking about managers and structures or people that are actually involved in training as well, looking a lot more. And this is again something that I wanted to bring up conscious of the fact that we're not talking with the same stakeholders.\nUser Permission ends\nSILVIA\n32:28 \nSo we're having maybe three or four Baringa meetings in a week, but different people involved. So we're going to be running a session on Friday around. Reporting. Analytics is also one important focus as well as content management for this year. We're looking at the content hub. Whenever we are speaking about.\nPayment Gateway\nSILVIA\n32:50 \nI don't know with customers about multiple audiences, internal learners, but also externals POS partner customers, content management and analytics become a very important point. And a key one. Again, one of the main things that we're willing to do is not to stick to one user case scenario. And most of the customers with our existing customers, we're working towards improving learning in all areas of the business as well as you said how to manage the content in an easier way from the same platform essentially to a broader let's say pile of people if I can call it this way now on a reporting piece, and I know that we've been talking to you about how we can improve that, how is learner data displayed?\nIntegrations\nSILVIA\n33:38 \nHow our admin is going to retrieve that data? Is it going to be a real time? They know that you're coming again from a past experience with Cornerstone? So I was wondering if you guys already have a BI tool or something that is related to analytics that you're currently using? Do you have any idea?\nEMILY\n33:55 \nCharlie, does Power BIO?\nSILVIA\n34:00 \nAll right. All right. So that is again different ways for us as well to work with you as well. Again today's session was obviously completely different, but on Friday, if we can suggest or bring some other alternatives where you can gather that data and retrieve it as fast as you can to be accurate. And also in real time can definitely support you with that. So we shouldn't really talk about it because it's something that is really roadmap. We've got a new addition to the suite called learn data. That means we usually put at our customers disposal… the data so that they can process it somewhere else in the BI tool where they can display it as well. Maybe talking about retrieving that information in a different way so that managers and the business.\nIntegrations ends\nEMILY\n34:54 \nAs well.\nSILVIA\n34:54 \nAligned with how learning is going in that sense. So again, a lot of things on the table, we would wanna talk about what's actually meaningful for you guys. So if you have any questions, specific ones, just let us know and we can come up with answers cool.\nIntegrations\nSARAH\n35:15 \nFantastic. Thank you. And my very last question unless Emily's got something… is I was asked to check, do we get flow as part of our license agreement? Or is that an extra? We don't…\nGABRIELLE\n35:36 \nYeah. Do they both low?\nSARAH\n35:38 \nYeah.\nGABRIELLE\n35:38 \nNo. So Docebo flow is a completely separate tool. To be honest, it's not one that we see utilized that often because it has a very specific use case. So you have to either own the software as in you, you've built it and developed it yourself or you have to have access to the coding part of the software, which obviously like for example, if you use Salesforce Workday whatever they're not going.\nSARAH\n36:05 \nThey can have.\nGABRIELLE\n36:06 \nAccess to recode their software. So the only use cases we really see for people using it is like for example, other software companies where they like, for example, do, could write it into the, or Salesforce could write it into Salesforce for their own learners. But otherwise, we don't typically see it use that often just because you have to have access yet to be able to overwrite JavaScript and things like that in the software to get it to work.\nCoach & Share\nSARAH\n36:34 \nOkay. That's brilliant. That's all my questions. Thank you very much. It's brilliant. Lightning, Emily.\nEMILY\n36:41 \nSo, one of them, we were having a look and we were wondering, I might just have not looked into this enough. But we, when we were talking about communities, we were talking about potentially how we assign people to communities as like as their cohorts of a program. Is that possible to do? So, if we sign up and people assigned up for like a particular program we were running and it's a group of them, can we create a community of those people?\nSILVIA\n37:12 \nGabby, do we have coach and chair? Yes?\nGABRIELLE\n37:14 \nYes, we do. Okay.\nSILVIA\n37:17 \nI don't see why not, and I think that starts from pages more than anything.\nCourse Enrollment\nSILVIA\n37:22 \nSo depends on how you want to organize it. If it's maybe a month, you can give them access for a month or if it's based on an event and mix it up with ILT courses or different information that you might want to provide for that particular event. So, yeah, it's just a matter of setting it up properly. I.\nEMILY\n37:42 \nAn event, could it be potentially if we're talking about a session of an event? So say we have one particular training that we run, but we're basing it off of like one time and then another group is formed of another time. What?\nSILVIA\n37:57 \nIf I can, if I can ask the end goal, you've got the event you want people to talk?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They compared Docebo to its competitor Learnupon, noting that it is a 900 person organization with 250 people on their product team. \n• Sylvia mentioned that they are focusing on improving quality of life for super admins as well as increasing autonomy for power users. \n• Emily asked about integrating Power BI into analytics reporting while Silvia discussed content management within the platform and course enrollment options for events or sessions. END"}
{"prompt":"EMILY\n38:02 \nWe basically want to create, we'd say create sort of like a little community of that group because they're going through a program which could extend over a year. So we've got certain trainings where we're like you guys are a group of people, we want you to interact and talk to each other and learn from each other.\nCoach & Share\nEMILY\n38:19 \nSo what we'd wanna do is create a space for them to go in the learning platform and talk, ask questions to ask the expert or that social bit. And basically.\nSILVIA\n38:29 \nYeah. So I can think of a page that is specific to this particular event that you could add in la menu and keep in mind that those channels that you have where they can talk to each other contribute and ask the experts can as well have courses inside with those sessions and those events as in, for example, there's something going on next week and I'm enrolled in that particular session, another person that is working with me in the organization has the next session.\nCourse Enrollment\nSILVIA\n39:01 \nThe next day doesn't really matter. The course is going to be per individual and you can add it as well in multiple channels. So let's say that you've got all your analysts that need to participate today in today's session. But Gabby on the other hand is having another role and she has to attend tomorrow.\nCoach & Share\nSILVIA\n39:19 \nEssentially the same course around the same topic, can sit in one channel or in two where you give access to Gabby to the first one and to me to the second one where we don't have visibility on each other or you can have just one where we can share those things as well. So it really depends. We've got as well the cohorts feature so that you can define those groups at a question and answer level within a channel. It really depends how you want to organize this, but.\nSARAH\n39:48 \nSo, would you suggest, would you recommend? Because we've got channels and communities and we're swapping between them. And the way I understood it was that channels were, it was the recommendation engine. So that would, you know, push recommended learning to, you know, sort of somebody who meets the criteria to join that channel… and that the community was the social learning space. I've got that, right?\nSILVIA\n40:21 \nNo, that's exactly it. How I would see the community in this case would be a channel, right? That is rolling around a topic or course?\nSARAH\n40:31 \nSure.\nSILVIA\n40:33 \nRight. And it can essentially be at one page where you give them a little bit more information about the event, maybe a video, a banner or something where again, they can see or chat only about that particular event.\nCoach & Share ends\nSARAH\n40:48 \nHuh. Okay.\nSILVIA\n40:51 \nThen again, keep in mind that those channels are or you can add them. It doesn't matter how many you've got, you can have like 20 of them. You can only add one channel per page if you want to. And that channel is going to be specific for the page and for the event that is the page really in the end, right?\nBranches & Groups\nSILVIA\n41:13 \nAnd then as I was saying, we can have as well. Something called cohorts depends on what visibility groups need to have on each other. The cohorts really users can be categorized based on groups as you probably know already, and you can manage the visibility of channels content at the questions and comments level, right?\nCoach & Share\nSILVIA\n41:38 \nIn base of the group of belonging of people, right? So that is a property of the channel itself. So if a channel is an event, then people in there can be grouped together and given visibility on a question and answer side of things. So again, full flexibility in there depends on how you want to put it in.\nBranches & Groups\nSARAH\n42:02 \nSo if we had an event set up and somebody enrolled on that, how would they get into the channel? Would that be an Automation?\nSILVIA\n42:16 \nIt could, meaning we'll think about it. You can automate the through the groups. You can put me when I get enrolled in that session, you can put me in a group that is specific to that event.\nBranches & Groups ends\nSILVIA\n42:32 \nI can also set another group. So I can have the one specific to my role, my level, and so on. But that one can give me visibility to a certain page, let's see. And as long as I have visibility to that page, you can display to me as well that channel, right? That we're talking about. Essentially. Again, it really depends my question is maybe, do you want me to see that channel? Even if I'm not part of the course?\nSARAH\n43:00 \nI see.\nSILVIA\n43:01 \nOr not. You can again leverage, we go back to the a PI peach. This is part of the workflows that you might have in mind.\nBranches & Groups\nSILVIA\n43:12 \nI get enrolled in a course and that can trigger me being part or giving visibility to a channel. These are things that you can automate via APIs. Otherwise it's quite a manual.\nSARAH\n43:27 \nOkay. Okay.\nEMILY\n43:32 \nThe other thing, correct me if I misunderstood this era, but I think angel brought up Branches or Charlie brought up Branches and whether we could change the name of Branches.\nCustom Reports\nEMILY\n43:45 \nSo it says business user or geographies instead so that people could understand what exactly that was because I know that we've got a report function which says… if I can find my way back to where it says Branches dashboard. But if we wanted to say, I don't know dashboard or something else or a performance by branch or whatever.\nCustom Reports ends\nEMILY\n44:06 \nBut do we have to use the word branch for instance, or can we remove that? Because I realize Branches used in many places.\nSILVIA\n44:15 \nSo let me just show you very quickly.\nEMILY\n44:19 \nThis the localization tool again with the being able to update. So whatever we were, we.\nSILVIA\n44:26 \nYes. So this is the main place where you would go. And here, it's English obviously. So if we just type here branch, you can see that you've got different places where you see that wording. So essentially, you can keep it on the admin side as it is or you can maybe change it in the audit trail or in other places. So everywhere really and there's so many places where you can, where you can find that wording where you can change it in here or you can again compare to another language. I think this is English only and change the words in here. So this as you call it…\nEMILY\n45:10 \nCross.\nSILVIA\n45:11 \nCountry, yes, it's going to be a manual process unfortunately.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily and Silvia discussed creating a space for participants of a program to interact with each other, ask questions, and learn from experts.  END"}
{"prompt":"SILVIA\n45:21 \nBut I'm not seeing… again. A lot of places where you would want to replace it. It's essentially one in the user management. And then whenever you enroll users in the course, is that's important? Obviously, you have to have clarity on that. I don't think you're going to be interested in. I don't know stuff like a help or I mean you're probably not gonna use that on a node or impact or stuff like that. So it's gonna be probably two or three places… not everywhere. I think if I'm not mistaken.\nEMILY\n45:59 \nThat's fine. That's useful for us to know though because it does mean we can figure that one out. So, so can't we?\nSILVIA\n46:05 \nOn the translate. And then, again, as I was telling you before, whenever we're talking about and it's probably not the right place to do it. If you go on inspect, you can as well change the CSS not entering into too many details.\nLayout & Content\nSILVIA\n46:23 \nBut if there's a word that you don't like, you can overwrite it and make it important in the CSS part of the platform, which is admin menu, configure and look and custom style. Yeah, I think I could see you change the.\nSARAH\n46:44 \nBut we can check, but it's okay. If we fiddle around with the CSS on the platform, it's not going to break anything and you're not going to come back and tell us that we've ruined your company or anything.\nGABRIELLE\n46:56 \nWell, not at.\nSILVIA\n46:57 \nAll, I mean, the instance is essentially going to be yours. What we…\nSARAH\n47:02 \nI can do.\nLayout & Content ends\nSILVIA\n47:02 \nIs just for retrieve it back as it was that's a maximum we can do. So, yeah, we had situations in which somebody broke it like very bad. And, yeah. Well, it was almost again quite a hard work to bring it back to where it was. But in this case, again, we've got as well. Plenty of customers that are turning the background all black and the netflix scenarios right? Where they transformed the LMS just like their platform, right? To make it look and feel like theirs. So… we can go quite far in the process and not worry if you break anything.\nSARAH\n47:46 \nFantastic. Thank you so much for re, showing us. I think I are prone to break things. Well, I am that's…\nBranches & Groups\nEMILY\n47:54 \nWe figure it out those, Sarah, we figure.\nSARAH\n47:57 \nYeah. Yeah. And then angel gets hold of it and breaks it.\nEMILY\n48:01 \nAgain, I probably have just missed this one. But regarding recommended channels that we're giving people, we can automatically assign those based on like their job role or their assigned skills, right? That's the thing we can do with that problem.\nBranches & Groups ends\nSILVIA\n48:20 \nYeah, the channels are assigned based on a branch into.\nEMILY\n48:24 \nYeah, cool. And that is all my question.\nSARAH\n48:28 \nYeah. And that's me too. I.\nSILVIA\n48:30 \nI'm welcome. I'm taking away with me the, my team button if we can remove the remove from my team and the, my training points and my team.\nWrap-Up\nSILVIA\n48:42 \nSo both are related to the same feature, taking this with me and getting back to you through Gabby as soon as possible.\nSARAH\n48:49 \nBrilliant.\nEMILY\n48:50 \nAppreciate you taking the time out today, I know. Are you?\nSARAH\n48:55 \nYeah. And you've been very patient and very kind with us. Thank you very much. Are you feeling a Gay?\nSmall Talk\nGABRIELLE\n49:02 \nI'm okay. Yeah, not so bad. I have a bit of a pain in my back today, but otherwise, good. I'm yeah, I, I've just done all of the baby's laundry and then I just know I left them in like boxes.\nSILVIA\n49:15 \nI just…\nGABRIELLE\n49:16 \nNoticed that one of the cats has been sleeping in the box because everything is now covering cat air.\nEMILY\n49:21 \nMy…\nGABRIELLE\n49:23 \nMorning, we have like, you know, the sleeping bags that you put the baby in like the SAP.\nSARAH\n49:27 \nAnd one…\nGABRIELLE\n49:28 \nOf the cats was…\nSARAH\n49:28 \nJust in…\nGABRIELLE\n49:29 \nSide it like having an, this is not for you get because now, like everything's covered in cat hair, but then I went article this morning that says the babies who grow up with pets have better immune systems because.\nSARAH\n49:40 \nYeah, they don't they don't have any choice. To be honest. I remember the very nice lady and John Lewis sold us a cat net, which is like a net that you put over the cat.\nSILVIA\n49:55 \nSeparate. Yeah.\nSARAH\n49:55 \nLike the baby?\nGABRIELLE\n49:56 \nNothing's gonna stop my cat.\nSARAH\n49:58 \nCat on our cats. You thought it was a hammoc, put it up five minutes later, both of them, this wasn't these two idiots by the way. Another pair of videos. Both Frank and joy were just curled up on the net, right? Individual. No, it's a cat ham, not a cat net.\nGABRIELLE\n50:21 \nYeah, we…\nSARAH\n50:21 \nSet up.\nGABRIELLE\n50:22 \nOne of the play mats the other day and the cats were like a new toy for us. Thank you. So, yeah, I don't know they've been obsessed with my belly. So, I'm sure that they're going to be like following this child around everywhere. So, see everything's covered in cat, her, but everything is a…\nSARAH\n50:39 \nYeah. Well, you know, they're gonna suffer in a couple of years time when they have their tail pulled every five seconds.\nGABRIELLE\n50:45 \nYeah, she's gonna get her own back for sure.\nSARAH\n50:48 \nBig sloppy Tom, he is.\nGABRIELLE\n50:51 \nBut yeah, no, otherwise, I'm feeling all good. Thanks. Yeah, all.\nSARAH\n50:56 \nTo know.\nGABRIELLE\n50:57 \nPerfect. Cool.

{"prompt":"NATALIE\n0:00 \nGood morning, Ruutu.\nRUTUJA\n0:02 \nHey. Hi. How's it going.\nNATALIE\n0:05 \nSo far? Yes. So it's birthday. So one day before Friday, so they would die.\nRUTUJA\n0:13 \nSo how How is the weather?\nELISA\n0:16 \nHi. Where.\nNATALIE\n0:18 \nIs great and still pretty cold. But I've seen getting closer to the spring, so let's say Oh,\nRUTUJA\n0:28 \nYeah, Same here. It's like for like, surprised. It's it's sunny here.\nELISA\n0:35 \nSo I was like, Oh, maybe it's a good.\nRUTUJA\n0:37 \nChance to go out for the walk, but let's see.\nNATALIE\n0:40 \nAll right, so we're gonna wait for your colleagues. Still, they're gonna come, right? Yeah.\nRUTUJA\n0:46 \nSo I invited a few folks from I t. Because I think it's good if they are in this call and, you know, rather than back and forth, we just settle this. Definitely.\nSmall Talk ends\nNATALIE\n0:55 \nDefinitely. Let.\nRUTUJA\n0:56 \nMe just.\nNATALIE\n0:56 \nLike you.\nRUTUJA\n0:58 \nYeah,\nNATALIE\n0:59 \nRight. Yeah. So we probably like we're gonna talk a lot of about if you have an integration request, how it should look like So we're gonna finish this step, and then we have an overall look of the whole project. Yeah,\nRUTUJA\n1:13 \nAbsolutely. So I started.\nNATALIE\n1:17 \nA couple.\nELISA\n1:17 \nOf questions. What? You,\nRUTUJA\n1:20 \nYou know, raised in previous email. I was just searching for, the answers, so.\nNATALIE\n1:27 \nYeah. So, actually, the most important question is, what kind of systems we're actually talking about?\nRUTUJA\n1:34 \nYou mean the integration, right?\nNATALIE\n1:36 \nYeah.\nRUTUJA\n1:37 \nYeah. So I spoke to, some of my i t folks to start with, we are on Google workspace. So absolutely Google workspaces one integration, which, oh, here is, hi. Kwanza is working in HR, teams. She's taking care of a lot of things. So, it's important to have cancer in this God.\nNATALIE\n2:08 \nOkay. So nice to meet here on our side is also here are solutions, architect, I think before we start and everyone is completely in a quick intro around and then we're gonna jump into the to the system. So,\nRUTUJA\n2:21 \nYes, let's do that.\nNATALIE\n2:24 \nBut you can.\nALEJANDRO\n2:24 \nAlready tell.\nNATALIE\n2:25 \nMe the names of the systems. You wanna? Yeah. So.\nRUTUJA\n2:29 \nYeah. So yesterday, you know, spoke to my i t folks and cancer was also in the call, and then we briefly discussed so, to start with, we would say Google workspace is where, you know, that's, one important integration point. And slack is another thing I can think when it comes to integration. And, we have a charge system in place called Hi, babe. Yeah,\nNATALIE\n2:59 \nAll right. These briefings. Okay, It's a priority. And,\nZAKARI\n3:12 \nFor being it. So.\nRUTUJA\n3:16 \nMaybe Natalya. Now we start with the quick introduction, and then we can take over the question.\nNATALIE\n3:21 \nExactly. So we are complete. My name. I'm Natalie. I'm here that I can execute it at the chairperson. My responsibility is to serve all new client movements or interest movements and the main contact person here in this project. And yeah, it's nice to meet you all to see all the new faces, for this meeting. And the goal of today is, of course, to clarify all i t integration here. I will pass my colleague Lisa, right.\nELISA\n3:50 \nHello. I am Elizabeth on Solutions Consultant here at the table. And, well, that was the one actually making the demo tour, A couple of weeks ago, and, well, I take care of all the more functional and also sometimes technical requirements that you might have. But for the, really technical requirements we have here Alexandra. So, please.\nALEJANDRO\n4:18 \nYeah. Hello. Good morning. My name is Alejandro Luna. I'm part of the solutions architect team in the chair at the table. And what my mission today is to help you and guide you to explain how the change can be integrated with other platforms, as you already mentioned. So nice to meet you, everybody. Awesome.\nRUTUJA\n4:41 \nThank you.\nZAKARI\n4:44 \nSo I'm that from the head of connectivity of dealing with clients and suppliers integration. So that's it. Great.\nELISA\n4:55 \nThank you.\nZAKARI\n4:57 \nAnd.\nRUTUJA\n4:57 \nI think that, you already spoke, but yeah, maybe Alejandro, We are meeting for the first time, so I'm led to a recently joined us. I think it's three weeks now. It's my third week.\nAbout Docebo\nZAKARI\n5:10 \nYou're from, yeah, at least here. Yes. I was.\nRUTUJA\n5:17 \nWorking in the capacity of a consultant helping, david, couple of, you know, processes around goal setting and stuff, but yeah, I recently joined. I'm heading the strategy, part of, you know, the topic here in, pretty. And, a learning management system in place is one of our requirement.\nIntegrations\nRUTUJA\n5:37 \nThis is where we got in touch with you. we did a couple of POC s. And like I said, we found very professional. And and the tool is really able to solve for what we are looking at. So I think that's the reason we are in this final call here. So yeah, that's my role. I'll pass it over to Monza.\nKENZA\n5:56 \nGood morning, everyone. Can celebrate. I am the HR manager of the group. You know, Morocco. So Yeah, that's all.\nNATALIE\n6:10 \nOkay, thanks a lot. So I would say, let's start about talking some integration. So this is gonna be more I t based conversation today. More technical. So router already said we want to talk about an integration of Google workspace slack and HIV and srh our system high book. Any other integration, which is a priority in the first place?\nIntegrations ends\nRUTUJA\n6:38 \nSo maybe is that quickly, I'll just ask 12 questions, and then maybe you can take because you are the i d. Exporting the skull. So, Natalia, my first question is, will more integration mean more time for rolling out the system? That's my first question.\nNATALIE\n6:56 \nNot really, Not really, because it's actually we're in our eight weeks on boarding for your project. We already have, like 3 to 4 weeks where we really do all the configurations. So it's also included with, of course, more I t. But as I can hear you, you're a bit in a hurry. So, it doesn't matter. But of course, if it's too complicated, it could cause a bit more. But what I want to say is too thick, really about what is important in the first place. Because if you think maybe half a year could be disintegration, interesting, you can always do it. So it's not a must that you need to configure everything immediately. All system. It's just like really good to have the system what you need in the first place or consider. Yeah,\nRUTUJA\n7:45 \nOkay, okay. So I think that that's fair enough. So maybe we can start with the basic integration and what I hear from you. Let's say what does time We realised hair were missing on this integration. So this is something which we can evolve over the time. So there's no, like a certain stone thing that Okay, this is it. And then we cannot really exactly.\nNATALIE\n8:05 \nSo we are here really flexible. And we go with your growth and your time. So don't stress yourself too much to fight all integrations and then say, Oh, my God, I forgot it. So we can do it really after three months And it if you need it. Exactly. And my.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The goal of the meeting was to clarify IT integration, and various team members were introduced including Rutuja (Head of Strategy), Elizabeth (Solutions Consultant), Alejandro (Solution Architect) and Zakari (Connectivity). \n• They discussed integrations with Google Workspace, Slack, HIV and SRH systems.  END"}
{"prompt":"RUTUJA\n8:20 \nAnd my second question is about the commercials, Let's say when we talk about integrations. So, in the commercial, package what you shared with me, how many integrations are included in there or does it like, but integration? You charge extra. So maybe a little, augmentation would help their.\nNATALIE\n8:38 \nThat's exactly the meeting where we have it to find out if there are some additional costs for the integration. Because we like with our standard package, we actually don't cover any expectations. But we have always the possibility what colour? And maybe Alejandro release to explain you between RP, which is.\nRUTUJA\n8:56 \nYou.\nNATALIE\n8:56 \nNot to pay for our integration, to connect them and connect to where it's needed for some integration you requested where connector is just the right thing. So that's why we are sitting here to find the right solutions for you and to find out what is possible and in which way it's possible.\nRUTUJA\n9:14 \nMm. Okay, so So each integration Come, come with the extra cost. That's what it.\nNATALIE\n9:22 \nCould be as well that we just.\nNATALIE\n9:24 \nHappy. So it comes. Oh,\nRUTUJA\n9:27 \nAlso.\nELISA\n9:28 \nDepends. Sorry if I'm interrupting you, but for example, it depends on what you need. Because if you're talking about slack and zoom, for example, it comes included in the package, at least for the standard needs. So I suggest maybe we start scoping it a little bit. Understand what you wish.\nIntegrations ends\nELISA\n9:46 \nWhat is your requirement? Your needs. And so that we can better understand also. Then what is included and what is not included? I.\nRUTUJA\n9:54 \nI totally get it. But because, like, as a strategy responsible, I also want to be frugal and budget because my other goal is cost optimisation. So I don't want.\nRUTUJA\n10:06 \nOver the board with have everything without, so I don't want to do gold plating of our solution. So maybe I wanna start with what's covered in free.\nALEJANDRO\n10:19 \nSorry for interrupting. I think we should start 1st. 0.9 point with the work space. I would like to hear you because works.\nIntegrations\nALEJANDRO\n10:29 \nBut, you know, it's a suite of different products. And I would like to know which products are you using for workspace? And how would you like to integrate workspace with the, so yeah, you know, the typical integration is Google calendar probably. Or Google drive, or I'm not sure if you are going to use other products of a workspace. So, please, can you tell us what is, use for workspace? Zach,\nIntegrations ends\nRUTUJA\n10:58 \nDo you wanna take this question? Because I think you're more,\nZAKARI\n11:03 \nUsing occupies workspace. They are, like, you know, Gmail, Google calendar drive, scream sometimes ab script for our daily communication for our daily for everything. So it's like it's our office. Our like our office. Okay.\nALEJANDRO\n11:25 \nOkay.\nZAKARI\n11:26 \nJust Yeah.\nIntegrations\nALEJANDRO\n11:30 \nHuh. So let me tell you basically, for example, we have integration with these three products that you mentioned. Let me share my screen quickly. Just make a brief introduction of the interfaces, works, and then I can go touching one of these that you mentioned. So, well, this is how the table looks like if we put the chair in the middle of the screen And what we have the possibility to integrate with different or with using different mechanisms. The mechanisms, more easy or easier. The easiest mechanisms are the applications that already exist in the chapel how it works. So you have the control panel, you have the possibility to enable, an application. And then the application is already there.\nKENZA\n12:28 \nAnd the.\nALEJANDRO\n12:29 \nBasic functionalities, for example, for dry, which means that you will have your complete five repository available in the Chievo to move files into the Chievo will be available.\nCourse Enrollment\nALEJANDRO\n12:41 \nThere is some integration means that when you create a novelty session, you can, interact with soon to create a video conference in within the i l T session. This is another example. Or, we can have SS o integration. For example, we have Gmail. So it means that the users that are registered in your Gmail account or in your Google account can be or can use SSO in order to, logging into the chamber.\nIntegrations\nALEJANDRO\n13:14 \nSo I mentioned briefly these three integrations which appears in this side. So these are applications that are available. You the only thing that you have to do, enable them and configure. And you have a functionality available in the cable. So this integration are these integrations are for free Unless, well, with the exception with the salesforce integration, which we are going not to talking about the second kind of integration is, what already not only mentioned related to the kpi. So everything that you can do in the chapel can be done also from, is available from our restful API. So basically, if you want, for example, provision a new user or create a new course or export information about the learner progress outside the chapel, you can leverage the restful API. We have hundreds of endpoints that are available to perform different activities or different operations on the change in the show. The other integration is a work group. So it means that when something happens in the channel, you can send data outside, by invoking or by making a request to an external AP I right. So, for example, typically, when a course completion happens on when the user is enrolled to a course, we can send notifications via an api so that you can consume kpi s via Web hooks. We have also more than almost 100 different events that we can or you can configure to send information outside.\nIntegrations ends\nALEJANDRO\n15:10 \nSo the third integration is sftp file. So basically, we can do via automation, consume or produce, CSB files that could be put in sftp servers. And then, for example, again, the typical use cases from sftp File or SFTP server You can put there as USB, file that contains new learners or new courses or new enrollments.\nIntegrations\nALEJANDRO\n15:43 \nSo it means that we can do whatever you can come to the FTP server, consume the CSD file and integrate the information into the, as I mentioned enrollments, new users and so on. And the third, the fourth integration is done via product called Connect. So, by the way, I have to say that these three sftp or automation app, web hooks and restful and, absolute integrated are for free. About the third product is the Connect is a platform is a no called local platform that allows you to connect and to create your specific war flow to connect with third party business systems. So you can see here that we have some business systems that are together or are repeated. However, the information and the tasks that you can execute here is basically animated. It means that you can create flows to validate information, to discriminate information, to get information from here to achieve a and the other way around. By using this platform to connect, I will show you a little bit later detail how it works. Please let me know if you have any questions. So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rutuja and Natalie discussed the cost of integrations in a commercial package.\n• Elisa suggested to scope out Rutuja's requirements first before understanding what is included and not included in the package.\n• Zakari mentioned that they are using Google products (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) for their workspace needs.\n• Alejandro provided an overview of integration options available with Chevo: applications already existing on Chevo; RESTful API; web hooks & SFTP file automation; Connect platform for connecting third party business systems. END"}
{"prompt":"RUTUJA\n17:17 \nI have one. So do I understand it, right? That connect is another product. So it's so when we used to go as a platform for our training elements usage. And if you want to connect with these third party vendors or systems, we need to go wired to connect. And we pay for vo connect usage, as you know.\nALEJANDRO\n17:39 \nHow are you? Yeah,\nALEJANDRO\n17:43 \nThat's okay. The use case that you have, for example, for hi Bob for Hi, Bob, I don't We don't have any integration with this Using, application, however, could be possible to use sftp Depends on your use case. We need to study how or what were the best approach. But for example Hi, Bob could be here. And if I have to be able to create a CSB files, then we can consume the information produced by High Bob and we can avoid to use connect and saying the other way around We can put some files that will be available for home consumption and then have a could, introduce or to the data to, for this platform. The other way to connect allows us to create Let me go to the chapel. Connect. So, connect is a sweet is a product part of the suite that allows you to create recipes. This is how the workflow those are called incorrect. So the recipe, basically, it's a set of steps that you can build by drag and drop building blocks, and then you can configure in every step how to do or what to do, right.\nUser Permission\nALEJANDRO\n19:03 \nFor example, this is a use case, or this is a This is an example that it helps us to users that are already expired. For example, we get all, the users, that whose explanation. That is, in some time in the, some time ago. And then based on that, the platform could decide to remove or two and minimise the user input.\nIntegrations\nALEJANDRO\n19:31 \nSo this is something you can see that this is local. So because it doesn't mean that you have you need to have a strong, programming knowledge or developing knowledge. This is this is relatively simply that you can build by yourself. Also. Everything starts in the chapel, connect everything starts from a connector. So we have a lot of connectors for almost every one. Well, not every system, but we have a lot of connectors for many business systems in the market and the way in which you can start Connexion. I'm.\nRUTUJA\n20:14 \nReally sorry to interrupt here. Just one quick question. Zach Enza do.\nIntegrations ends\nRUTUJA\n20:19 \nDo you think we want to spend another 10, 15 minutes on Connect? I don't see that we have a current use case or.\nZAKARI\n20:27 \nEquipment for this. I.\nRUTUJA\n20:28 \nThink this is something which probably women.\nRUTUJA\n20:31 \nSo I would recommend we do not spend time.\nZAKARI\n20:36 \nIt's.\nRUTUJA\n20:37 \nA great functionality. A, great, the product. But I do not see a use case for us right now. Okay,\nIntegrations\nALEJANDRO\n20:46 \nSo let's continue our exploration.\nELISA\n20:53 \nJust can I just interrupt for a second and I'll give you the world to you again? This is just a way, you know, to show you that there are many possibilities, so you can do everything, like, not everything. A lot for free. So slack integration, For example, zoom integration. You can use s FTP folder for user provisioning also, which is for free. But if you want in the future to have more integration, more also, for example, real time update of users with High Bob, for example, or with other systems that you might need to use in the future.\nIntegrations ends\nELISA\n21:33 \nYou know that you have the chance to do that, and you can do it very quickly. Because what Alexandra was showing you is that you don't really need to be a super I t person to met Also, this functionality.\nRUTUJA\n21:48 \nNow,\nELISA\n21:48 \nI suggest going back to the basics and getting back to the list of, tools you would like to integrate.\nMobile App\nELISA\n21:58 \nSo the table works. Sorry. Google workspace. We were mentioning. You can have for free So you really have the application? They're available in the platform, With Google Drive, huh? And for SS. Oh. So for single sign on for users who use Gmail.\nRUTUJA\n22:20 \nYeah. You.\nELISA\n22:22 \nWant to connect the Google calendar, Alexandra, correct me if I'm wrong.\nMobile App ends\nELISA\n22:27 \nSo if you want to have a real time Connexion with the calendar of your users, you would need to use the table. Connect. Okay. So this is, in Aden that you should pay. So this is the first thing, If I go on slack integration, What would you like to have with slag? Precisely.\nCourse Enrollment\nRUTUJA\n22:59 \nSo I think, Let's say, as a user, I would like to get notifications of the trainings, which I enrolled.\nNATALIE\n23:09 \nFor.\nRUTUJA\n23:10 \nAnd, I'm not sure if we do not ask for Google calendar integration, then probably, I don't know the workflow which we want to have with Google Calendar. If we can have it with slacks, and I cannot think it, very clearly, but that's okay.\nNotifications\nELISA\n23:31 \nSo, in general, with the notifications, part is included. So.\nRUTUJA\n23:40 \nYou think, like, can you think through like, what, workflow would we need when it comes to slag, I can imagine, as a user, getting notifications would be one. Definitely.\nELISA\n23:55 \nSo notifications are included. So this means that whenever, for example, an event and I'll thi event is going to start, they can receive a notification that the event is going to start. So this can be a good replacement for a calendar problem.\nLearning Plans\nRUTUJA\n24:12 \nYeah, for.\nKENZA\n24:14 \nExample, from me for the high ball part When, for example, a new hires. He starts the first day. He has already the notification, for example, for the pre onboarding or the onboarding. And, yeah, So there is this link between the two, and, we'll get there all the notifications about, for example, if he already finished the on boarding the results and all that. This is the kind of, this.\nLearning Plans ends\nELISA\n24:45 \nIs the managed to buy the platform in general. So the first thing my Alexandra, please feel free to interrupt me in case the first thing is, how does this user get into the table? So there are various options. You can do it with Google with single sign on with Google. You can do it with the sfp sftp folder. So it means, for example, that every night the table will pick up from that folder the information about new users, and they will be created in the tribal and so on. So when the user is in the shade Bo, you as an administrator, of course. Will help you with that. We'll set up a page so that they.\nNotifications\nKENZA\n25:35 \nAutomatically.\nELISA\n25:36 \nSee that page, that pre onboarding page. And when they finished the pre in boarding, they will automatically see their own boarding page. So the next one. Okay, so this is done in the platform.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rutuja and Alejandro discussed integrations with third party vendors or systems, as well as user permissions.\n• Elisa mentioned that there are many possibilities for free, such as Slack integration and Zoom integration.\n• She also suggested going back to the basics by creating a list of tools they would like to integrate.\n• They discussed mobile app use cases such as Google Workspace and Single Sign On (SSO).\n• They talked about notifications when an event starts or new hires begin onboarding processes.

{"prompt":"RUTUJA\n34:05 \nTo start with, let's say a user sign up and log, Inside the then the journey should start, in a way that the user should get notification about new courses he's assigned to or she's assigned to are the new courses which are launched and maybe interested. Interesting for the user. So let's say different. Different, notifications from the table to slack. That's one way,\nMobile App\nALEJANDRO\n34:30 \nWhich.\nRUTUJA\n34:31 \nIn the start we could look at and definitely, integration with our guy Google. Space. So in this case, I think Google calendar cost extra. So I would not go with Google calendar than right now. Maybe just with slack. It's easy. And and also with this, you know, the free Google Space.\nMobile App ends\nELISA\n34:52 \nExploration.\nRUTUJA\n34:52 \nWould do.\nELISA\n34:53 \nTalking.\nRUTUJA\n34:54 \nAbout just one more point quickly. I'm talking about Hi, Bob Lanza. Maybe we need to take a quick, How to say scope. We need to build a little scope around what we expect, workflow between docebo and hi, Bob. What? It should happen because you also mentioned that we sometimes, hiring, like, you know, the people whom we are interviewing. We we also want that we can give them some assignments and stop there. So I don't know how you want to tackle that scope here. I.\nKENZA\n35:27 \nThink there is two parts for the parts for the herring. We don't need the link with the high bone. So I will need just, for example, I can send the test to the candidates, and, he can, like, complete the test, and I can receive the results. This is where I will be needing in this part, for the other parts for the new hires or people with the colleagues here on high bod. We need the part for the link with the talents, because for the evaluation and all this, maybe we'll have the trainings with the test. So we need to test the link in this part. Yeah. This is merely, need today.\nIntegrations\nRUTUJA\n36:05 \nYeah. So if so, Alejandro, if I talk about hi, Bob integration, will that fall into, the connect part? Don't ever connect. Will it happen? Why are that?\nALEJANDRO\n36:18 \nYeah, it depends on the use case. According to the escape that cancer told us? Yes. Let me rephrase what you said.\nIntegrations ends\nALEJANDRO\n36:29 \nIf just to confirm that I understood your use case. So basically, you will start your hiring process in High Bob. And then this user is created in High Bob, and then they have to take some courses in the chapel. And if they passed the courses, or if they complete the course is then the cheetah has to notify or have somehow has to know that the devil that something happened in the chair, and then you will continue the process in high. That's correct.\nALEJANDRO\n36:58 \nOkay, in this case, yes. We are going to exchange information between hi, Bob. And we need a middle word in behind, between. So let me show you quickly how this can be done. For example, let's figure that you have a new employee or we have a new people enrolled in High Bob.\nCertifications\nALEJANDRO\n37:22 \nAnd then what you have to do, or what you need to do is enrol this user in the chapeau because the user has to pass some activities or do some activities, pass exams and so on. And then So we need that platform or we need to notify. Somehow the user was created in high above and then the user has to be created at the same time and provisions in the chair.\nCertifications ends\nALEJANDRO\n37:47 \nSo that's a typical use case for the contact, right? And then the second step is let's figure that the user already finished all the courses and tests and so on, and then the information produced by the course finishing has to be reported again to live up. So also, we would need another recipe that update the users. Well, in this case, we have a user's that update from high up to the cheque, what we can and retrieve the learning progress in the Chavo to highball. So basically, this happens in an automatic way. You can configure any data that you would need in High Bob that will be synchronised from level to hide in any time at any time of the day. For example. So, yeah, this is a typical use case in this case you will need you would need Hi, Bob. However, if you want to meet using another platform of the sweet, you can use sftp file. So basically you can create your users list from High Bob in a CSE file. You put these files in a server and then the chip. What comes to the server and enrols them automatically in an automatic way the other way around could be so you can create a report to report the progress of specific users. And you can put these users in a series defile in an sftp file and in a in an automatic way, you can make this automation. So you decide what would be the best approach for you.\nIntegrations\nRUTUJA\n39:41 \nOkay, one more question what it means in terms of commercial. So let's say this kind of connect we used for High Bob What would that mean in terms of, because, yeah,\nALEJANDRO\n39:55 \nJust let me tell you that, connect to enable the product and the charging is based on the number of connectors that you have.\nRUTUJA\n40:06 \nYeah,\nALEJANDRO\n40:07 \nSo I think that Natalie is the best person to expect that.\nNATALIE\n40:11 \nExactly surprising for one connector is 6500 plus it Council and onboarding price, which is 4500. That's the price per year for connector for one connector,\nRUTUJA\n40:25 \nOne connector And when you say one connector right now, Alexandra, you explain that our tour recipes one is high Bob to do so And then there's a high bob. So is it? Is it considered to be one connector or one connector means one way. So how do you define,\nALEJANDRO\n40:45 \nOne.\nALEJANDRO\n40:45 \nCan I mentioned? Everything starts from a connector, so you enable a connector like this so you create a new connector, and then the connector is can be used for any task or for any number of recipes. So you can build.\nNATALIE\n41:04 \nThree.\nALEJANDRO\n41:04 \nFor 10 recipes using one matter. If you decide to use other connector, then it increased the price. So.\nELISA\n41:12 \nOne connector with two way communication between the chamber and, is possible. Yeah,\nRUTUJA\n41:19 \nUnderstood. So it's It's not about the workflows. It's about, you can send us amount of communications to. It's about one system, one platform, which you're connecting right. That's.\nALEJANDRO\n41:33 \nGot.\nALEJANDRO\n41:34 \nThe important thing. Sorry is to mention that you will have available the connector because you will connect with the external platform.\nKENZA\n41:47 \nHowever,\nALEJANDRO\n41:48 \nYou can get any number of recipes using the connector. For example, an optimisation or automation reporting or any other tasks using the connector. So you have the connector that allows you to connect to Chavo? Yeah,\nALEJANDRO\n42:05 \nTo the elbow. And the second connector, which is, we charge allows you to connect to outside in this case, however.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The connector was quoted at 6500 plus onboarding fees at 4500 each END"}
{"prompt":"RUTUJA\n42:15 \nOkay. Got it. So cancer. Is it? Okay, I think we take this information with us, which I'm in a little bit around. Do we really have extensive use case here to invest another 10-K in the system? Because I think we're talking about 50% of what we will pay for, oh. As an LMS for So I think this is something which probably we need to take back and then discuss and come back to you again. So we definitely want to go ahead with, integrating the trouble with our system. And like we all agreed on, we would start with Google, workspace and, slack integration, And And we will you this hybrid, model here. So sso and sftp so that, you know, we can fulfil all kind of users requirements here. And I think this is a good to go starting point. Or.\nCourse Enrollment\nELISA\n43:08 \nLike, can I add something more? So.\nELISA\n43:11 \nYou were mentioning also, room. Right. So this is also included. Can we ask you which type of account you have for zoom? Maybe Alexandra, you might jump in, but do you know which type of account you have to have? Enterprise account?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRUTUJA\n43:32 \nAs far as I know, I think we have enterprise. Zach, Maybe you know it better. Because I got credentials for enterprise, which is this unlimited thing that the business zoom like. I.\nZAKARI\n43:44 \nDon't know. I don't have I don't know. I don't have, okay.\nRUTUJA\n43:49 \nNo, we do have,\nZAKARI\n43:52 \nI'm always been invited to me to never created them. I under one Creating. Yes.\nCourse Enrollment\nRUTUJA\n44:00 \nI do have an enterprise account with zoom here.\nELISA\n44:03 \nOkay, So this means that this is also an application included, so you don't need to pay for it. And as a trainer, you will be able. You're trainers, of course, will be able to create the appointment. The lt So the webinar directly from the platform and the learners will have the link there. Okay, so this is another thing that comes for free and that you can include.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRUTUJA\n44:27 \nOkay, cool. This is a This is a good, thing to know. May I just quickly interrupt and ask another question, Natali, if you would be so trying to send me a list of whatever is included, I will not deny as a business entity, they always like three things. I mean, whatever is included in the system, maybe there's a list and I can just have a quick cheque that Hey, these five things we just definitely need and the rest of the things we can leave, we don't We would not get about it. Is that possible? Okay.\nNATALIE\n44:58 \nI'll try to like to give you a list. I guess, I have kind of this overview. Let's see. I just want to make sure that we are not going to go in the first place for connector. No.\nNATALIE\n45:10 \nAll right. So just to make sure so that the integration requests what you ask there for free. So they included. Okay, So they offer what you got. It stays the same price. Nothing is changing. Now, if you like to have a connector, it's just for the connect to €6500 more. And you know, the on boarding is a one time fee. So it was just for the first year. Okay, so we're gonna stay with this in the first place. Yeah. What you have received?\nRUTUJA\n45:43 \nYeah, absolutely. Start with this and then I can see, and I can a little bit chiming into this topic of, you know, what is the usage? And what kind of use cases that I'll be having is the pricing frugal 40 kind of usage rehab. So maybe we do a little bit of analysis on that part, and then we come back to you for you.\nNATALIE\n46:01 \nLike like I mentioned you Can You can buy a connector whenever you would like when you see. Okay, maybe it makes sense after half a year. Okay, let's do the connector. Yeah, it's just your decision, so I don't want to push it to anything. Take your time, think about it and added, whenever you think you're ready for it.\nIntegrations\nRUTUJA\n46:21 \nPerfect. I have 1 to 2 more questions, though. One is you mentioned about dutiable library for training, right? I missed that last time. Is that included in the package? What we are revealing?\nNATALIE\n46:36 \nThe tribal content is not included as a tool. So you have here different kinds of packages.\nAbout Docebo\nNATALIE\n46:41 \nYou can source 50 courses 150 or unlimited a number of courses. So this comes with a price. I will tell you how much it costs. So you have already indication so. It's part of 50 courses is also from our library. It's 7500 then, for the 2, 150 to 150 courses.\nIntegrations\nNATALIE\n47:07 \nIt's 15,000. And for unlimited courses, sourcing is 21,000 list price. So these are the content library, Many companies using it in case they don't have content. In place because we seemed content to create their own content. It takes time, and it's even more pricey. Then sourcing content square.\nRUTUJA\n47:31 \nEnough. So I think this is a good information which I can again chime in and come back to you. Last question. We do have good Amy credentials with the company. We do have a company account for me. Is there a possibility to integrate those courses in like a user is doing courses with Jamie. And then can that be somehow integrated with the system? Or that's not,\nNATALIE\n47:56 \nI have to pass to the technical funds to, to respond This.\nRUTUJA\n48:01 \nOkay?\nALEJANDRO\n48:02 \nYeah. Lemme is another business system that has to be integrated using connect.\nZAKARI\n48:08 \nBecause.\nALEJANDRO\n48:09 \nEvery user that is in me has to be replicated in order to exchange Also the learning progress to or the finishing. Okay.\nIntegrations ends\nRUTUJA\n48:19 \nOkay, Fair enough. Got it. Alright. And the last question, like I said, I had two more questions. So, the commercials, is there a partial way of paying it or is it a one time payment we do at the start? Because I think it's very important for my CFO to know. How would we said the payment?\nPayment Gateway\nNATALIE\n48:43 \nIt's actually are normal. Payment is net 30 annual.\nRUTUJA\n48:50 \nSorry I didn't get it,\nNATALIE\n48:51 \nAnnual payment next 30 days.\nRUTUJA\n48:55 \nOkay.\nNATALIE\n48:56 \nThat's our actually standard what the customers.\nRUTUJA\n48:58 \nDo. Okay, So let's say we say, Hey, green signal, let's roll out. Next Monday, system. So we have to pay before that or we have to.\nPricing\nNATALIE\n49:11 \nDo,, No, no, no. You get you get an invoice and you have one month time to pay it. But it's, it doesn't matter. We start the onboarding when you started. It's not like you have to pay for us. And then we started on the no. We start the on boarding and you pay after 30 days or something. No, no, no. It's independent of this. No way.\nRUTUJA\n49:33 \nIs there a way we can make it into three time payments or two time payments or something?\nNATALIE\n49:38 \nI will ask if we can offer you semi annual or quarterly, if it's possible. Okay? I was very,\nRUTUJA\n49:46 \nVery favourite of ours because we want to have a long term.\nNATALIE\n49:51 \nOkay, so it's for you. What is your wish? What is your payment? With what? You have 30. I think that's what Are we gonna stay? But you wanna have quarterly.\nRUTUJA\n50:00 \nQuarterly? My finance guys really happy. If it's okay,\nNATALIE\n50:04 \nI will see if it's possible and we'll come back to you. So yeah, let's see. Alright.\nOnboarding\nRUTUJA\n50:13 \nSo I think we we've agreed upon, we would like to roll out, and we already discussed what to start with and then over the time we can decide how we want to proceed here. So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rutuja discussed integrating Google Workspace and Slack into their system, as well as Zoom for free.\n• They will start with a hybrid model to fulfill user requirements. \n• Natalie provided information about the Docebo content library packages, which range from 50 courses to unlimited courses at different prices. \n• Alejandro mentioned that each user has to be replicated in order to exchange learning progress or finishing of coursework. \n• Rutuja requested a quarterly payment plan instead of net 30.

{"prompt":"RUTUJA\n50:22 \nHow the rollout work. So what would happen in next? Let's the next five days or.\nOnboarding ends\nNATALIE\n50:28 \nWhat? I will show you a slide, so you'll have a bit You know of an idea how you have to plan it. How does it look like? Let me just how Open something. And please let me know if you already seen something. Because sometimes I have no idea.\nOnboarding\nNATALIE\n50:45 \nAlright, great. So the kickoff, What happens? Actually, what is the goal of our own body? So The first goal is, of course, to configure the platform to understand the use cases, your wishes and requirements to set up the video business cases, needs. And then we have, of course, another goal, which is really the onboarding. Where would be not give you only like, where we are not implementing only the system. But the goal of the onboarding is to give you guidance and the knowledge. So at the end, you will be able to use easily and effectively the platform and of course, one of the soft lounge So here we will roll out the platform for a few amount of users to test everything before we will roll out to everyone.\nOnboarding ends\nNATALIE\n51:39 \nSo, you know, when we have the stuff lounge, you can still test, makes changes and then say, Okay, now it's perfect. And now we roll out to every other one. How does it look like? Exactly? So here we have to the chamber on board. We have, eight weeks.\nOnboarding\nNATALIE\n51:57 \nWe stand with the kick off, you're gonna meet your account manager, you're gonna meet your trainer, and I will be as well as to kick off. We'll talk about the US is decides we will kick things off by getting to know each other and understand your team skills. Then we refuse the onboarding programme and show the step by steps, the whole milestones and what you can expect the coming weeks. Then we have the discovery. We work together to design a plan to chief initial business goals For your LMS, we will define key business objectives. This will be our goal post provides structure and shared purpose is in your team. We will hear really as well leveraging the L. A. PI s or all the integration request and technologies and in define those tasks to indigenous recovery as well. Then you will, fill out our use case document that will resend you in advance. And we will discuss in depth doing our first discovery meeting and develop 1 to 2 key business objective based on your initial goals and requirements to address doing your own boring. Then we have the biggest part of the argument. That's a configuration validation and testing. Here we will touch really several topics starting from usual provisioning. We talk today. A lot of users producing a says that we will establish the structure for you are learning project and make sure that any advanced platform settings are defined in order to get your users onto the platform.\nLearning Plans\nNATALIE\n53:24 \nThen we have the content management. We will discuss how to build quality courses, learning plans and learning objectives, and then use the experience. Of course, bring your learning platform to life by creating pages menus and configure the look and feel you've been dreaming about.\nNATALIE\n53:42 \nAnd configure rules for enrolment. We also talked about enrollment rules today a lot and set up reports to collect critical metrics,\nBranches & Groups\nZAKARI\n53:49 \nThen.\nNATALIE\n53:50 \nAutomation and reporting the size we wanted, like also set up all the documentation rules, which means.\nRUTUJA\n53:57 \nUser.\nNATALIE\n53:58 \nOne is a new employee. But he belongs to the sales group, which means after he finished the on boarding courses, he will automatically be transferred to the dedicated sales training.\nNotifications\nNATALIE\n54:11 \nCool notifications also, point that we touched today. You can set up different kind of notifications you reminders about please finish the course to the deadline or you haven't started the course or you have been involved in this discourse and so on. So there are many different kind of notifications which you can set up only to get in the platform or both as well to get emails, get in their notification via email.\nOnboarding\nNATALIE\n54:40 \nAnd then the first big thing is the soft launch like I already touched it before. Here is the time to get feedback from your team and stakeholders. From here we will conduct and to air end to end testing, finding any problems and fixing them quickly in case there is something that working and yeah, we can tweaks can be made to your final design to make sure it's perfect. for your business. And then we have the transmission after lunch. With our long term supporting which we do the lounge and you will get the whole support about account manager. We'll stay with your contact and to our support team plus customer success manager.\nRUTUJA\n55:18 \nAwesome. Great. There's a good plan.\nOnboarding ends\nRUTUJA\n55:21 \nSo I have a request again, a lot of questions. A lot of requests coming from me. Can we reduce? Somehow? There is a possibility to reduce this week eight to, like, do you Do you need anything from our end That because I, feeling here that this is, like, the top? This is a week, A plan, considering everything. So you.\nNATALIE\n55:45 \nWant to see what is the top of 60 weeks.\nRUTUJA\n55:50 \nOh, well, then, okay.\nNATALIE\n55:52 \nAlready reduced it for you for eight weeks so we can really.\nRUTUJA\n55:55 \nDo.\nNATALIE\n55:56 \nThings up. I'm not gonna say you've got to meet eight weeks, but you have to calculate, Okay,\nNATALIE\n56:03 \nIt happens that we finished already much more quicker. But, you know, I'm not allowed to confirm.\nRUTUJA\n56:09 \nThings,\nNATALIE\n56:09 \nOkay? Something is.\nRUTUJA\n56:10 \nI understand that, but yeah, we'll try and tell.\nNATALIE\n56:14 \nMe when you wanna go actually live yesterday. Yeah, but I need to tell them you're trader, so Yeah, I get it.\nRUTUJA\n56:26 \nSo, to be honest, 4 to 5 weeks would be like a, like, how to say, like a dream. But,\nOnboarding\nRUTUJA\n56:36 \nYou want to go.\nNATALIE\n56:36 \nLive with, say, in April? Beginning of April. Beginning April? Yes. Go live. Okay, so it depends. Then. We have really to make things quickly. Yes, and yeah. Then we can start and do all these things. So it's up to you, to be honest. That's what my question.\nRUTUJA\n56:58 \nWas that? What do you need some hard? Until I understand we need to get into some sort of, of course, we need to set up the contract in place. We need to review and sign and give it back to you. We could start with some initial first time feed that setting fees, something so whatsoever. And then having this, payment, conditions in place. So there are some pre requisite.\nNATALIE\n57:21 \nThe next thing is, you said you're gonna keep with the offer what we sent you. So first the platform and we talked about some integration. Roots are included, so they were worried about that and we will get the order form. I was even. What? I need information for the out of form. Like, who's the building contact and so on? What would you like? How the platforms should call be snooty new, the academy. Whatever these things, I will send you like building contact. Billing address. Who is who would sign ultimately the name. So I will send you a list. What kind of information I need I will make sure as quickly about the payment conditions. So I will confirm all to come back to you, and I will send out the contract. And you will take a look at the contract in case you have some red lines that comes back to legals. And this is a thing of legal. Yeah. So anyone I can push things to send out this everything.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Natalie and Rutuja discussed how to plan the rollout of a platform, what the goal of onboarding is, and how it will be structured over 8 weeks.\n• Rutuja requested if they can reduce this timeline - Natalie responded that it depends but she needs some information such as billing contact details in order to send out contracts which need reviewing by legal teams prior to signing off on them. END"}
{"prompt":"RUTUJA\n58:15 \nYeah. Awesome. So if I get all of these things from you, let's say this week or start up next week,\nNATALIE\n58:24 \nI will send you the email immediately. And I will make a quick question before I send out the email about the payment, set up everything and then you will receive, contract. It's gonna be fast. It should be till Friday. Should be everything set up to help. Cool.\nRUTUJA\n58:40 \nAnd then from my end, by Tuesday, I should revert back with everything. So let's say we can shorten this time. So maybe you say we can already start with the.\nNATALIE\n58:50 \nYou need to always calculate seven working days till we start 7. 10 Max Wednesdays from the signature to do the kick off the first kick off.\nNext Steps ends\nNATALIE\n59:00 \nOkay, but I will push them a bit more, so let's see what is happening. But they're also just people who are working, to be honest. But you can tell me already. What's your desired onboarding language? It's gonna be English, right?\nRUTUJA\n59:13 \nEnglish. Okay.\nNATALIE\n59:15 \nSo send. You ever think you will receive today or Max, friday afternoon.\nOnboarding\nNATALIE\n59:22 \nSo it's up to the contracting face. How much you would like to change or if you're aligned of it? This is the face where actually decides how long we're gonna need.\nRUTUJA\n59:32 \nYes, that's something which is, dependent on us then. Then I'll make sure that also stakeholders and I'm the sponsor for this, So I think I don't need to take a lot of, from people.\nAbout Docebo\nRUTUJA\n59:45 \nSo that's some which is in my hand, but definitely one or two people need to review. And, like you said, the legal, compliant team need to at least have, you know, run through over this contract so that should be done by exactly.\nNATALIE\n59:58 \nAnd, we're told the airline, that's like a thing about legal, and we're not having that much impact. But just say okay, just a bit quicker.\nAbout Docebo ends\nRUTUJA\n1:00:07 \nCool. And the payment thing. Once you confirm that, I'll also you know,\nNATALIE\n1:00:11 \nWell, I will do in a email immediately to ask,\nRUTUJA\n1:00:15 \nSuperb. So we are looking forward, and I think that the value always was so prompt. And that's also a sign of how professional company work. You came quickly.\nWrap-Up\nRUTUJA\n1:00:24 \nWe're very swift in sharing things, so I think that reflects the culture of your company, and that's the reason we are going ahead with you. So I think that's really.\nNATALIE\n1:00:32 \nAppreciate. Thanks a lot. That's a team effort. Also, thanks to Liza and Alexandra, knowledge and information. It wouldn't be happened to be that fast, to be honest, so.\nRUTUJA\n1:00:45 \nI think this we don't have any more questions. I mean, I don't have cancer. Zach, do you do.\nZAKARI\n1:00:50 \nSomething? Alright. Awesome.\nNATALIE\n1:00:56 \nFacts are looking forward to.\nNATALIE\n1:00:58 \nWith you in the right direction.

So look, this becomes your proposal deck as we said, right from the outset. So really gonna go through this pretty quickly for the stuff you've seen. You know, we talked about what we're doing. We talked about the fact that it's gonna deliver on brand on engagement, your attraction and retention strategy. We covered off the problems we're solving and then how we're solving just to the point. I put question marks on these integrations not because we can't do them, but because we get to confirm what you wanna do and that will be part of it's part of the process. So if we're set or preferred or whatever, get the tech teams together, we'll work through all of that before we.\nTREVOR\n4:12 \nPoint. But, and I wouldn't bother if it's a significant change for you. If this is pre set… it could read possible integrations and then take off the question.\nWADE\n4:27 \nSure.

So, so today, we just…\nTREVOR\n4:59 \nJust one point if I could, so be a pain in the backside, it's come up, it came up with another supplier or another potential provider that we're talking to and I dismissed it as a very low priority. In fact, I almost said, I don't think it would happen but I'm just wondering whether in trying to get this thing across the line and any other… application or benefit might be handy. They were talking a lot about its use with customers. We've focused on employees obviously, and that's the by far prime motivator and driver. But I just wondered whether in there somewhere in one of the, you know, advantages or benefits or whatever it could be, you know, the potential to engage or share or whatever you say… with customers and external stakeholders or something like that.\nWADE\n5:58 \nWell, you've kind of just hit the real sweet spot of the by because it's our capacity to do the internal and external use cases off the one platform that a lot of people choose us.\nTREVOR\n6:08 \nYeah.\nWADE\n6:09 \nIt's so.\nTREVOR\n6:10 \nIt's not a prime driver for us but I'm just thinking if I'm in a CEO exec committee meeting and, you know… it's up there as people. Okay. Well, that's yeah, that's a positive.\nLayout & Content\nWADE\n6:27 \nLet me put, I'll put that in the deck somewhere. So, and that's absolutely on the cards and achievable. And that's the one thing I would say see, you know, you're looking at the internal use case due to by where you want to start priority all those things. But the ease to actually turn this into an external… platform there. I say, you know, clicks of buttons and dropping, you know, adding new pages that's kind of it.\nLayout & Content ends\nTREVOR\n6:57 \nAnd…\nWADE\n6:57 \nThat very easy. So, good to know. Thank you.\nTREVOR\n7:02 \nIt's all.\nWADE\n7:02 \nRight. So I'm just going to hand over to Kane now. So I'll you just let me know when you want me to go from slide to slide Kane, but I'll let you go through the onboarding and implementation stuff and then we can just get into the proposal after that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Trevor and Wade discussed the new general council, their solutions deployment team, and implementation process.\n• They also talked about how the platform will help Trevor's company with brand engagement, attraction and retention strategies. \n• They discussed possible integrations that could be used with customers externally before shifting back to discussing layout & content of a proposal deck. END"}
{"prompt":"KANE\n15:20 \nAnd then basically, we just deep dive into that… and we go from there the configuration that's the bulk of our, the chunky bit. The fun part. The biggest thing we like to focus on is, yes, you're there to configure that platform. But for us, it's really about customer enablement.\nOnboarding\nKANE\n15:41 \nSo we really want to enable you on all the features and functions within the platform. You will be configuring it. And then by the time that we had done with the onboarding project, like we mentioned the keys of the castle, you'll know exactly how to administrate the platform. So if you do want to go in and make any changes, you'll feel confident being able to do that as well further down the track.\nCASS\n16:01 \nOn fan, I'm assuming like all this is virtual.\nKANE\n16:04 \nYep. It is.\nCASS\n16:06 \nAnd so is from our point of view, would we just identify sort of key users?\nOnboarding ends\nKANE\n16:12 \nYeah. So you build a well, you know, recommend that you build project team, you know, whoever is going to be essentially your primary LMS admins. I would recommend having a secondary LMS admin as well just as a backup. You're gonna pull in people. So if you got someone from your marketing team to look at some of the branding, you'll pull them at different times.\nCourse Enrollment\nKANE\n16:34 \nIt will get involved at different times. You know, we work with them, we could do breakout sessions. Generally speaking. We'll do, you know, a session each week usually goes for an hour. Those sessions are really about… running through your use case and, you know, the topics and the features and the functions that support that. So, we have training available in our, the university… that gives you the foundation knowledge of like how to create a user, for example. But then in those sessions, we can really talk about, you know, yeah. Hey, you've got this system, you want to integrate that or, you know, how can we automate this process?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nKANE\n17:10 \nSo all these users automatically enrolled. So, you know, it's done and taken care of. So we run through that. In those sessions… good time to bring up any kind of edge cases. Anything like that. We go through best practices. And I give you examples of what others have done in a scenario like this.\nOnboarding\nKANE\n17:29 \nAnd then, yeah, we just really give you the tools to take it away and configure the platform. Yeah… from there, we drive to a soft launch. We really want to soft launch the product with a small subset of users. So that way you can not only test that you've configured the platform correctly and it's gonna work for your users. It really just solidifies the knowledge that you've gained about how to administrate the platform as well… where.\nCASS\n18:02 \nAnd…\nKANE\n18:02 \nIn your…\nCASS\n18:03 \nView, sorry, Kane, in your view, like how long should that sort of configure process take?\nKANE\n18:09 \nThe configuration side of things can take anywhere between eight to 12 weeks.\nCASS\n18:15 \nOkay.\nKANE\n18:16 \nJust…\nWADE\n18:17 \nTrevor, yeah, I was just gonna jump in. This is, you know, obviously as soon as they can, so they, they're aware and I'll explain to them the 12 weeks and, you know, what they can do and we can move it speed. So, at the moment, we're working towards a may 30 go live date. And Trevor and Cass were, you know, obviously that also determines on when decisions are made and, you know, tech requirements and all we've got, you know, legals, and all of that has to be completed before we can kick start the project. Of course, we have to be chosen before all of that, but that's the kind of thing to go for a may 30 go live date if everything goes smoothly and they chose.\nTREVOR\n19:00 \nHaving said that if we do choose you, we would have, we would do so with a clear objective to be the fastest ever implementation of the chain organization.\nOnboarding ends\nKANE\n19:11 \nYeah, it's with thing.\nWADE\n19:13 \nRecord time.\nKANE\n19:16 \nIn two weeks. So.\nTREVOR\n19:19 \nMaybe we won't need to record.\nKANE\n19:21 \nNo, I wouldn't recommend aiming for two weeks. Yeah. But like the thirtieth of may, I don't right now, I don't see any issues with that. Yeah, it's fine. All right.\nWADE\n19:36 \nSo, the other part, the other part is, you know, Kane, you was, you know, we've done with clients is if there's something that is really pressing, you know, a particular use case.\nAbout Docebo\nWADE\n19:46 \nIn your instance, there's a particular business or maybe a particular group of engineers or it's corporate, you want to stand up, you know, the corporate office or whatever that the, it might be a situation where you share that with Kane or Jody who might be doing the implementation part of the team.\nOnboarding\nWADE\n20:04 \nSay, look, we really want this one up as a P and that becomes like your, we can stand up quicker and it becomes like an end to end experience. And then we'll keep working with you post that. So there is means and ways that we can stand up things pretty quickly.\nTREVOR\n20:18 \nI…\nWADE\n20:19 \nDo…\nTREVOR\n20:22 \nI…\nKANE\n20:22 \nAnd we see that all the time people do like an MVP then they go into a soft launch, things like that.\nCASS\n20:29 \nWhat, what does support look like? Let's say, you know, eight to 10 weeks, let's say 12 weeks. We're pretty much launched and then I see you've got like a review sort of, you know, piece Bill team as forward frame, you know, a couple of months and we're using it. We say actually gosh, we, when we thought about setting this up, we didn't think about exploits. We haven't got this set up properly. We wanna make some configuration changes or, you know, our business changes and, you know, we're like actually we need to, you know, reset this, what sort of support is available and what does that look like is additional cost or?\nKANE\n21:05 \nNo, it's not an additional cost. By that point. We'll kinda hope that with a successful onboarding, you would be enabled and confident enough that you could make those changes. If you need to be down the track. If you want to implement new functionality, you'll have access to your account manager as well, who's with you the entirety of the contract and those things that you can bring up with your account manager and they have a team that could support them without that he can bring in and they can run through different functionality and talk about those use cases and how you can change it. So it's essentially, they're like an SDM just on the other side of the fence basically.\nOnboarding ends\nWADE\n21:44 \nFor example, Cass, we kinda touched on before, you know, creating an external use case to customers, for example, that would be a perfect example of where the account manager would come in, work with you how to develop that. Is there any additional products that you might want to have?\nPricing\nWADE\n22:02 \nMaybe 150 courses is not the case and you're in a position to budget for the premium package which is, you know, unlimited across the whole library, all of those things the account manager can work with you well, well after the implementation and onboarding complete.\nKANE\n22:17 \nYeah.\nPricing ends\nKANE\n22:19 \nI'm gonna have to shoot off very shortly, might just jump to the next slide. This one. I won't talk through much. You're going to get access to this, I believe. But this is just an example of different stages or different things that we can cover off. It's very high level.\nOnboarding\nKANE\n22:38 \nYou know, things might move switch around, but that's just an example of the type of steps that we take to get you to that. So launch… way if you could go to the mix one. And again, this is just a typical timeline that we would expect each kind of phase to take place.\nCASS\n22:57 \nOkay. Yeah.\nTREVOR\n22:58 \nThank you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kane discussed the configuration process and customer enablement for onboarding, which typically takes 8-12 weeks.\n• He also spoke about course enrollment, recommending a project team that includes primary and secondary LMS admins as well as members of the marketing team. \n• The go live date is May 30th with an aim to be the fastest ever implementation of Chain Organization if chosen. \n END"}
{"prompt":"WADE\n23:00 \nAnd this slide really just kinda reiterate what we talked about around the support piece. So, you know, our ongoing partnership, you'll have access to our knowledge base. You'll have access to university the community, your dedicated account manager. So it's all providing that, you know, that ongoing partnership and, you know, got to Chuck in a couple of big clients there just to get everyone excited about.\nAbout Docebo\nWADE\n23:25 \nYeah. But just, I would point out with this, it might come up in the conversation. So as we're saying we are a premium partner of Aws. So what the benefit of that for our customers is if Aws change anything with their architecture to a client a look after, which is fairly significant element.\nIntegrations\nWADE\n23:46 \nAnd also we access all of Aws as data. So we don't hold data as a platform that's not what MS does, but the data can be housed in Australia and often particularly the it people wanna know where the data is sitting. So it can, we have a data house in Sydney.\nWrap-Up\nWADE\n24:03 \nSo just you use the Aws. They are also our customer obviously, so, but that's just to give you that, but thanks, Kane. Appreciate it. Maybe.\nTREVOR\n24:13 \nThanks bye.\nKANE\n24:15 \nNice to meet. Everyone. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nWADE\n24:21 \nYeah. Just before we go onto, I guess the proposal, is there anything else around onboarding implementation? Any other questions or?\nCoach & Share\nTREVOR\n24:29 \nJust just if you go back one slide.\nTREVOR\n24:41 \nThat's if we pay for community, right?\nWADE\n24:43 \nNo community screen, I.\nTREVOR\n24:47 \nI thought on the call here the other day, Mel said community was an additional cost.\nWADE\n24:54 \nI know where I understand where you're going, the communities, which is to have coach and share. So the communities in your platform where your engineers are all learning together and speaking that's additional will talk about that in the proposal for the CEO community, where our customers talk about the platform, talk about what they're doing and tips and tricks and everything that.\nTREVOR\n25:15 \nA…\nWADE\n25:15 \nResource for you. And…\nTREVOR\n25:19 \nThat's a little misleading, not probably intentional but yeah.\nWADE\n25:25 \nTry.\nTREVOR\n25:26 \nThis is like, can I?\nWADE\n25:29 \nYeah, to the community, anyone could access at any given time? Like, you know, I don't…\nTREVOR\n25:34 \nSpeak?\nWADE\n25:34 \nTo us, you can just jump in there and see what people are saying about. So, so that's yeah, I understand where community and community is kinda social. The other communities we talk about is the social learning platform essentially that's the better way.\nOnboarding\nTREVOR\n25:47 \nThat's what I thought. Is this, it was part of it? Yeah.\nWADE\n25:51 \nYeah, yeah.\nWADE\n25:57 \nSo look, I'm just gonna touch on today on our pathway to go live and it's really, you know, as I've said, right from the outset, you know, we need to have a really clear date. We've got one, I think feels like it's pretty clear at this stage. We can clear that all up and that was, you know, preferred selected whatever the case might be. These are all the things that we will need to cover off on. So it doesn't have to be in a particular order. Obviously, you're going to be going to the executive tomorrow with our commercials and so forth which I'll talk about in a second, but I do know you need to make decisions quickly. You would like to move fast. So things that we'll need to do, I'm gonna send you through the Docebo to the Docebo paperwork with your proposal. So we'll send through the MS a agreement. It'll have all the information in the DP a that will be a document where again being that were selected, your legal team can go through the, you know, if they wanna make some red lines, cover off all of that. So you, you'll have that straight away.\nNext Steps\nWADE\n26:55 \nSo I wanna make sure you got that very rarely. Yeah, very rarely we wouldn't do it. But so 99 times out of 100 will meet with your it team because they'll have different conversations. They'll have different questions and so forth. So happy to do an it verification meeting. We bring in Mallory around that so they can ask any additional questions. Obviously, we've got some integration possibilities that we can flesh out all of that can be done. We bring them involved. We can, we often do a extended stakeholder or executive demo. So if you meet tomorrow with the team and executive says, look, we just like to see 15, 20 minutes of what it looks like and how it works. We can always do that and we just do it a little bit differently. It's not like an hour and a half thing. No executives gonna sit through an hour and a half demo. So we can do a 20 minute Q and a 40 minute kind of meeting if required.\nOnboarding\nWADE\n28:00 \nWe can obviously got the proposal review and the final agreement you'll have your paperwork that you'll need for us to do. We've got some information that we need to be able to do things like domain name again, I will send all of that information all today. So you've kinda got all of our info straight away because if you do decide that it's a good fit and you wanna move as fast as possible, you can because you've got all about information and we can work out what else we need to do. What? As soon as the contract thing that we selected, we sign a contract. The next day, solutions deployment team will start working with you. So straight away, we can move straight into it, you know, the project launch and the intro of the implementation team, which will be Jody, I think for you guys on a Kane team. And, you know, Jody and I will basically happy to set up that meeting of the day after the contracts finalized and in our platform. And then we're straight into the implementation process. So… is there anything that stands out there that you would need to, you know, it's a red flag. I know it's kind of you've got decisions to make around commercials, but is that all kinda clear? Is there anything on there that you would need for us to do a person to meet with anything like that?\nCASS\n29:21 \nMaybe more this more of a like thought, you know, I don't know whether this is something that you'd want to do or not.\nOnboarding ends\nCASS\n29:30 \nBut instead of like where you, but I think you had something in there around like the stakeholder demonstration, I'm just wondering whether it, whether you've got like any kind of videos or anything that would make sense that level that could help rather than because Tray… guess that we're probably not gonna get them in a room to have a demo of this.\nWADE\n29:55 \nNo, it's not. It's just so I'm clear, it's not a requirement from our, you know, if they're happy to, you know, the, your, they charge you to be responsible for it. If they want to see something that's the only reason we would do an executive demo.\nCASS\n30:10 \nWhether it's an option, whether if you've got any like videos or anything like that we could use.\nWADE\n30:19 \nYeah. Sorry. Yeah. What I'll do is I will when we land on which product suite you want to use, because remember, we're going to have a look at the content and I use the social learning and the Shape tool. But Trevor saw at the end there where we can create the micro learning pills. If you want to keep all of those in this particular proposal for tomorrow. What I can do is I can send a video for each of those products, a link and put it in the email. And that way, I mean, the just the marketing videos on our website.\nCASS\n30:54 \nYeah, I don't know. I think that's an option for those that do want to actually look at it.\nWADE\n30:59 \nI think.\nTREVOR\n31:00 \nSome of them may.\nWADE\n31:01 \nGet some benefit from…\nTREVOR\n31:02 \nThat I'm hoping do need it as part of their approval.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Wade discussed the ongoing partnership and access to knowledge base, university community, and dedicated account manager. \n• Trevor highlighted the need for information around onboarding implementation and Wade went over their pathway to go live including sending paperwork with proposal, meeting with IT team for verification if needed, extended stakeholder or executive demo if requested by executives ,and project launch once contract is finalized.  END"}
{"prompt":"WADE\n31:06 \nYeah. Yeah. The other option you've got Cass, I mean, again, their executives, so they might want to just look at something, but you can always, they can always jump into the demo, have a quick look around and then if you want if they wanted to, but that's probably a little bit, maybe that's a little bit sort of two hands on maybe a couple of.\nCASS\n31:26 \nThey're gonna spend the time working on working the way around. That was like a quick sort of snapshot video like he's kind of like the overview of what it can do.\nWADE\n31:36 \nI'll do that. I'll send you the vdi, I'll…\nCASS\n31:38 \nThe more.\nWADE\n31:38 \nSome…\nCASS\n31:39 \nOf them aren't even look at it.\nWADE\n31:41 \nI'll put it, I'll put live links into the email the, you know, the full complete email that I'll send definitely do that. Yeah. And as I said, these things aren't… you know, there's no concrete right or wrong around this pathway to go live. It's just from our experience. When we work with organizations. We know that these are the kinds of things that people need to have a look at. So, and the people who want to be engaged, you know, during the decision making process… okay?\nCASS\n32:12 \nI…\nTREVOR\n32:13 \nDocumented all on. And I might be getting confused with the other possible in the sorry to say… that has been an effective… supporting proposal that could be submitted to rather than sort of me writing one from scratch and pulling bits and pieces from here there and everywhere is.\nAbout Docebo\nTREVOR\n32:44 \nHave you a developer like a pro forma… yeah.\nWADE\n32:50 \nNo.\nTREVOR\n32:53 \nBenefits. Yeah. I blah blah blah. I know I can pick it out of.\nAbout Docebo ends\nWADE\n32:58 \nYeah. I mean, it depends some organizations we do for RFP and things like that. What I tend to do is that's what this deck here is really for those first couple of slides, they're more specific to your use case. I appreciate like from that, you kinda got to instruct your ROI out of that we don't have is necessarily an R, I kind of document. Yeah. But what I'm hoping with those first three slides is that the executive can clearly see that we've first that we've understood what you are looking to do because I think that by those questions, then we've got real clarity in those boxes around. Well, what are the things that we're actually are going to put into the, to the solution? And then that last one is like this is actually what you get. And so I'm hoping that those three slides can kinda cover that off hopefully but happy to add as much information as I can into the email. So put the videos in. I can put in the broad information. I've always, I think I might have sent you guys at the outset. I'll flesh it out a little bit. I wanna give you everything you feel that you need to put us in the best position that's my job. So.\nTREVOR\n34:16 \nYeah.\nWADE\n34:20 \nAll right. So let's have a look at the proposal just in the time.\nPricing\nWADE\n34:25 \nSo we got 10 minutes here. So just want to go through the elements that I'm proposing as the solution based on the demo that we've done and the conversations that we've had. So we're looking at a 500… monthly user monthly I'll change that.\nCASS\n34:42 \nTo clarify just to clarify that, put different users each month as long as we're not going to.\nTREVOR\n34:49 \nSo… active users.\nWADE\n34:54 \nI'll put the word active in there spot on an active user is someone who engages with a piece of content. All 800 people can be looking on the platform and checking out what it looks like and all that kind of thing. But until they do a piece of learning, they're not considered a monthly active user. It can evolve revolve. Yeah, we just know that we talked about it before, you know, we do have a package of 300, but I think from what Trevor, you've said, you know, that you're constantly getting this two to 300 to 500 gives you the capacity.\nPricing ends\nWADE\n35:25 \nIt might even give you capacity to even test and measure when you're ready the external use case because you might say, well, we've got some capacity here every month. We could take on a couple of customer and we could trial a customer level education training element or as you acquire another business, you've got more capacity.\nPricing\nWADE\n35:47 \nYou don't have to necessarily move. So you'll be able to track that really easily. The to go learn app built in no additional cost that's all built into the platform. We're going through 150 course pack of 500 is so again aligned with the capacity of the platform?\nTREVOR\n36:04 \nSorry, just helped me understand 500 going nuts. What's that?\nCASS\n36:09 \nAnd say active user?\nWADE\n36:12 \nMonthly active users. I could probably just take it out and just leave it as is 150 course pack now.\nCASS\n36:18 \nYeah.\nWADE\n36:19 \nYeah, I'll take that out. Happy to do. That. Could be confusing. They think another 500.\nPricing ends\nTREVOR\n36:26 \nJumping ahead. You're including coach and.\nCASS\n36:27 \nShare and Shape in.\nTREVOR\n36:30 \nThis.\nWADE\n36:31 \nIt now, if you look at it right now and say, rip it out, I'll rip it out and send you the proposal as is. But if you want to keep it in there?\nTREVOR\n36:40 \nTo have it maybe within without a cost?\nCASS\n36:43 \nWell, costing what?\nWADE\n36:44 \nI do. Yeah. And look, the implementation is a one time fee for that onboarding process. So let me show you how I've itemized it. And then you can let me know what you would like for me to how you'd like for me to send it through.\nTREVOR\n36:58 \nYou're gonna come to another, yeah, you've done it that's where I thought it was gonna suddenly appear in this box.\nWADE\n37:04 \nIt's my big review.\nTREVOR\n37:09 \nThere's no total here. I've got a Wade up in my head.\nWADE\n37:13 \nIf you need me to add it up, I can do that for you, but I want to just itemize it because I don't know what the, I don't know what the total will be.\nIntegrations\nWADE\n37:20 \nSo look based on our conversations, I can tell you that, you know, learning content sits around the 52 K mark. So, when you said to me my around 60, we can certainly do the content piece and the platform piece. As we flashed out a solution for you, we all, you know, agreed that the social learning and the AI authoring tool were attractive.\nPricing\nWADE\n37:45 \nSo you can see that that's you know, an additional sort of 12 and half 1,000 on top of that. So you're looking around 65,000 for the entire solution with your implementation fee per annum over a three year contract. So, you know, that's where we, I'm going to be normally my, I'll be completely transparent. I think, you probably know that I am based on our dealings this far. I normally just go here's. A price, come back, negotiate and I'll give you my first and first, my first and final price. I've gone straight into the first and final price because of your time frame. So I am, I'm putting my…\nPricing ends\nTREVOR\n38:25 \nYeah, this is everything. This is everything that's in the pot.\nWADE\n38:30 \nThis is the best I can provide.\nCASS\n38:33 \nApologies because I know I had to run early yesterday Trevor how critical is the Shape pace?\nTREVOR\n38:45 \nNot pretty cool… but attractive.\nCASS\n38:51 \nI guess it's also for only five grand year like.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Wade proposed a solution for Docebo, which included 500 monthly active users and 150 course packs.\n• The total price of the entire solution was estimated to be around $65,000 per annum over a three year contract.\n• Trevor found the Shape Pace feature attractive but not critical.

This is the platform and inclusive of the app.\nCASS\n39:50 \nShe's the 100…\nWADE\n39:52 \n50 content package.\nCASS\n39:54 \nYeah, this.\nWADE\n39:55 \nThe communities.\nCASS\n39:56 \nAnd…\nWADE\n39:57 \nThis is your a I authoring tool to create your own micro learning pills.\nPricing\nWADE\n40:03 \nSo as a holistic solution based on what we, this is what I feel is optimal for you guys as a starting point. But I understand this budget and where you want to start. So.\nTREVOR\n40:15 \nYeah, that's all right. Because that brings it in at six 666 six nine three.\nPricing ends\nWADE\n40:22 \nThere you go.\nTREVOR\n40:24 \nOn the subscription with the implementation, when the other 11 grand implementation for what it's worth. So it's slightly cheaper on implementation.\nWADE\n40:36 \nWell, I think again, we've mentioned this already, Trevor, but I think the critical place there is you're not going to be coming back and being charged to change anything into you that's you know, if there's one thing that I know that leaves a little bit of a sour taste in businesses mouths is that they, when they want a business changes or change. So when they want to reconfigure, they got to put their hand back in their pocket, they're not and more so it's the time.\nTREVOR\n41:05 \nYour…\nWADE\n41:05 \nTime to re, engage with the company. Whereas if you got someone internally, they know their admin, you buy a new business, you create a new page, you link up all the learning pathways bang, you know, very quickly, you can onboard a whole business and know that all of their learning needs are met very quickly… and not have to pay us to do it for you.\nPricing\nWADE\n41:28 \nIt's there and of course, we're here to help, but you don't have to pay us.\nCASS\n41:32 \nSo Trevor works out 85 50 per user… per employee, not user.\nPricing ends\nTREVOR\n41:49 \nWell, where we're at… my… sense being open and honest in case you please put your bid in. We've got two slightly different options that we're putting up… both. And the advantage I think or a positive is that both options… are purpose built MS. So that's a start. The, what comes with the, in our view… really, that is the differentiator is that we get LMS plus a really good content library.\nIntegrations\nTREVOR\n42:44 \nWith the other option, we get a good LMS… with… an easier and easier option to extend into a broader HRIS?\nCASS\n43:02 \nAverage content library.\nTREVOR\n43:04 \nYeah, yeah. We would be choosing one for its content library. The other if we chose, it would be for it's more seamless integration with the other. Now… I know you got, I get that.\nWADE\n43:23 \nIntegration is kind of a specialty for us. So I, I'm not, I don't want to say that's inaccurate because I don't know exactly what you're talking about that they have that they've talked about integrating with. But the, our capacity to integrate with an HRIS system is from my understanding and the conversations I have as good as anything in the market. So anything you think that they, they're providing on top of what we can from an integration to HRIS, all be kinda with.\nTREVOR\n43:54 \nI respect that absolutely. And to some extent that benefit is more a perceived and psychological one that it is all under the one system umbrella. It's not to, and from a branding and all that perspective, it's hour, MS linking with employee connect for your HRIS linking with, you know, payroll… the, what the other platform offers is the holistic stuff in one platform that's all… in one name.\nIntegrations ends\nCASS\n44:35 \nIntend…\nWADE\n44:36 \nRather than just learning, yes, I can understand.\nCASS\n44:39 \nIn fact, in clarity of that, we haven't been quoted a price for that.\nTREVOR\n44:48 \nYeah. We're looking at LMS versus LMS. It's just what the they're the differentiators that's all.\nCASS\n44:55 \nYou…\nWADE\n44:56 \nKnow, we can get to that it chat and those integrations can be part of this.\nIntegrations\nWADE\n45:00 \nThere wouldn't be, you know, if we get clarity that you want to integrate what you currently have to make all of that seamless. Even though between, you know, from our perspective, we're looking at three three pieces of technology, but from the user experience, it will be seamless. Then that just comes in as part of this implementation.\nIntegrations ends\nWADE\n45:20 \nThere's no additional cost on that for us. We just have to know that that's what you wanna do when we're implementing it that's…\nTREVOR\n45:27 \nYeah, look, and we went over this but I'm just in my mind, I could have it wrong to be honest, probably had, but, you know, I'm in Docebo and I want to go and do a performance review. So, while a seamless integration into it, a software that's got my performance review might be possible. I go in there and it looks different. It's got a different name. It's you know, it's got a different look. It's going to be really hard to absolutely mimic the style look and feel of calms in a different systems performance management module that…\nWADE\n46:07 \nWell, then you're right now, you're not inaccurate. What I'm getting is you're talking about one has the capacity to be the end to end employee journey platform and we are specifically in learning. So you spot on there. I'm just wanna make sure that I've been clear about the fact that we can integrate.\nTREVOR\n46:29 \nWith any of those?\nWADE\n46:31 \nIs what we do special? It's a specialty.\nTREVOR\n46:34 \nI get that. Yeah.\nCASS\n46:35 \nAnd Trevor, I think if we were to just look at sort of like in terms of competitive process and offerings from an LMS point of view, if we were to take out the seven eight, the community space, it's pretty much very similar. But the added advantage I think is the community.\nTREVOR\n46:58 \nYeah, yeah, yeah. It's just gonna have to be how much that's valued and.\nWADE\n47:04 \nAnd your access to the Go1 content, which is the content you really been after the whole, so.\nTREVOR\n47:12 \nOne last comment from me and it is early, but I know I'll be asked reference sites… or who are there two or three that you can provide to me with the names of the contact people that I can ring and have a chat about their experience with a?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The Shape solution includes an AI authoring tool to create micro learning pills. \n• Trevor was concerned about integrations with other software systems such as HRIS or performance management modules; however, Wade assured him that integration is their specialty and would not incur additional cost on implementation.\n• Trevor asked for reference sites including contact people he could speak with regarding their experience using this platform.

{"prompt":"MICHAEL\n0:00 \nHi, John. Hello. How are you doing?\nJENNIFER\n0:04 \nGood. How are you?\nMICHAEL\n0:05 \nI'm doing good. Can?\nJENNIFER\n0:08 \nBeen an entire week since we saw you?\nMICHAEL\n0:11 \nI know… Christine just logged in as a cat again.\nCHRISTINE\n0:17 \nI had just made sure I turned it off before I logged in. So apparently the cat is just here to stay forever.\nMICHAEL\n0:25 \nKnow it's a great ice breaker so we can.\nTIM\n0:28 \nI gotta be honest. I love it more than anything.\nCHRISTINE\n0:32 \nCannot get rid of it.\nTIM\n0:35 \nI laughed about it just randomly the other day. I thought about that when you came on. So I appreciate that very much.\nCHRISTINE\n0:44 \nGood. I'm glad I can print to.\nSmall Talk ends\nTIM\n0:46 \nWe go. So when you go on Zoom, it's always the cat.\nCHRISTINE\n0:51 \nYeah, I just went and changed like the settings to make sure it's not even on like the avatar. I just, I turned it off. I have no idea why it just pops up. So… so I just.\nTIM\n1:09 \nI like it. All right?\nMICHAEL\n1:13 \nOkay. So thank you guys so much for taking the time to meet with us today. The goal for today is mainly just a conversation just to discuss reporting and pricing and next steps for you guys. But is there anything that's happened in the last week? Maybe it's something that's been brought to light that you guys would like to discuss today?\nOnboarding\nJENNIFER\n1:34 \nNothing new has come up?\nMICHAEL\n1:36 \nOkay. So what we'll do is I'm gonna have Tim kinda discuss the onboarding process for you guys and what that's gonna entail over the 16 weeks that we have planned out for the onboarding piece. Then we'll touch on the pricing piece exactly for what's going to be a best, you, a best price for a best price point for your team.\nOnboarding ends\nMICHAEL\n1:56 \nAnd then we can discuss reporting and then maybe follow up with some next steps for a follow up call and bring on any other additional members that we need to bring from both teams either yours or ours. Does that seem like a good plan for today? Yep? Okay, great.\nTIM\n2:11 \nQuestion for you guys. So I know we showed you a ton… of stuff last week and you guys gave us a ton of information too on what you didn't like and what your, the future couldn't hold for you. I knew you guys were going to get together and just brief any, give me what's your feedback based on what you after you guys had a chance to kind of contemplate what we showed you. What were your thoughts?\nJENNIFER\n2:38 \nSo, the, I feel like the overall thought was… this is both excellent and very terrible, right? Like we went, I personally, I shouldn't speak for, Christine went into this thinking. We're stuck with Cornerstone forever, like everything else would be a significant compromise. And, you know, who even wants to get into that detail with all of our training partners and leadership and all of that? And then, yeah, to find out that there is a comparable, you know, for everything that we need, but that's also doing it better than what we're experiencing today. That was a bit of a bummer because that makes this whole thing more complicated. But I guess you guys knew that would happen demo. So, yeah, so we've got a lot of work to do, you know? So on the one hand, it would have been almost significantly easier for us if you hadn't been able to deliver on a lot of the features that, you know, we minimally expect because that would have just a reinforced our expectations.\nSmall Talk\nTIM\n3:49 \nWe're stuck.\nCHRISTINE\n3:52 \nYou too good for your own.\nTIM\n3:54 \nBut…\nJENNIFER\n3:56 \nBut no, but I mean, this adds a facet to it that I mean, it's… kind of invigorating, right? Like, I didn't realize how… maybe disappointed I was with Cornerstone because I've been trying to, you know.\nTIM\n4:14 \nThe…\nJENNIFER\n4:14 \nWay through day to day.\nSmall Talk ends\nJENNIFER\n4:16 \nSo, yeah. So now, I'm thinking more about like what it would look like to actually have to convince leadership that this is worth doing, which is exciting because, yeah.\nTIM\n4:28 \nOkay. Well, we'll put a pin in that because we can absolutely help you with… that. So, Christine, what about yourself?\nCHRISTINE\n4:38 \nYeah, I'm completely on board. I told Jen I'd be the cheer leader just because I've been to sorry, my voice is going in and out today. Still sick. I've been to so many different conferences and seen so many pitches to Jen point. When we go into these demos, it's typically like, you know, there's not a great expectation that things are gonna work out well or you're gonna have, you know, the capabilities that we need.\nLayout & Content\nCHRISTINE\n5:07 \nSo the first demo or like it just blew me away. So, I need to see more from like the admin perspective and like what that looks like, but, you know, being focused on the user experience like it's just, you know, exactly everything that I could have asked for and you guys already have it. So.\nLayout & Content ends\nTIM\n5:34 \nThat's great. That's great information. If you have a list of things that you wanna see from the admin side, what I'd like to do is get… you know, make sure that we put together a great, you know, presentation for you whether it's either us or somebody else from the side to demo that for you?\nJENNIFER\n5:59 \nYeah. We, so, I know Tim, I don't think you were there for the initial conversations you probably have heard them or Michael shared that we do have a sub committee that we need to get on the books. Something in here. In the next month, we'll assemble with them. And my plan was to share the demo that you've already conducted. And from that generate more so like whatever Christine already has in mind, we have a Sharepoint site where we're aggregating those of like, must have nice to have whatever and so that we can do a decent comparison of what we have today or like other vendors that we want to talk to. So, yeah. So I don't want you putting any more time into demos just for us because I…\nTIM\n6:39 \nYeah.\nJENNIFER\n6:40 \nThere's…\nTIM\n6:41 \nAnything?\nJENNIFER\n6:42 \nElse that you have going on in the background would just be something that we'd have to get used to. Probably we're go forward. So, and I think that we'll have some more like… general stuff that will marry together better than like our specific ones and concerns.\nTIM\n7:02 \nOkay. That's good stuff. I question free Jen on that… sub committee, how's that broken out? Is there like an executive sponsor on it? And how does…\nJENNIFER\n7:16 \nSo…\nTIM\n7:18 \nIt…\nJENNIFER\n7:18 \nWill…\nTIM\n7:19 \nOkay. If…\nJENNIFER\n7:19 \nWe decide to move forward. So when we set out to do this, it was, I don't know it's been probably about five months that it was like we have to look at our LMS situation and decide if it's healthy, right? Like in advance of renewing with them one more time because the last renewal felt not great that, you know, if this is where we're stuck, then this is where we're stuck, but we can't just assume that without actually looking at it. But that was going into it. The idea is that we probably are stuck and then we just gotta keep asking for more budget to keep, you know, increasing that cost.\nTIM\n7:57 \nRight.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They plan to assemble a sub committee in the coming month along with an executive sponsor who will generate comparison between existing vendors or Cornerstone LMS situation by aggregating must-haves & nice-to haves into Sharepoint site before deciding further action points END"}
{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n7:57 \nWithout any value add. So, yeah, in just talking to that, we already have a governance committee because we have training partners. So like I've mentioned, we pay the Bill. We've never had to get into it of like if we want this to change or if we want to enforce whatever generally, we get consensus and then everybody's fine. We really haven't had to throw any weight around but we could, we don't have to. But yeah. So so far that sub committee is just volunteers people who are interested in staying engaged with it. And then, yeah, the executive sponsor… our VP of course would be involved but we'd be looking for, I would imagine it if we can't I mean we can make the case to pretty much anyone.\nAbout Docebo\nJENNIFER\n8:44 \nWe could go with our own president like on the consumer sales side and he could be the executive sponsor, but… I'm not committed to that idea because I think we have more traction if we got a different executive sponsor for it. So we'll see how it actually goes.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJENNIFER\n9:00 \nBut if we can get depending on who we can convince that this is work worth doing and get excited about it, we might be able to get an executive sponsor from a different area, which would just help to get things done to.\nTIM\n9:15 \nSo just so I understand your end, your end result learners are all internal, correct, not external at this point.\nJENNIFER\n9:29 \nHow there are some external where the goal is to make them internal? Yeah, we, they're our biggest Audience like numbers wise. Their footprint on the system is pretty limited. They're just taking basic training, but it's the recruiting process for the Bankers life brand. We actually allow them to bring new users into the training system through that self registration process. There's a form on Cornerstone where they put in their information and then administrator approves that and they sit there until a process on our back end. So outside of Cornerstone, we'll actually match up that pre contract or that new recruit user data with a user from our business system and turn them into one account.\nTIM\n10:19 \nOkay. So… it's sort of like a lead generating control if nothing?\nJENNIFER\n10:28 \nNo, I mean, so the leads are that's all in a separate like recruiting system?\nTIM\n10:32 \nOkay.\nJENNIFER\n10:32 \nAnd a separate department, just… if they agree to onboard, there's a whole, we do a lot of recruiting of people who are making a career change or brand new to the workforce. And so they are not ready to be insurance sales people and that they have not completed their minimum like licensing examinations that requires studying et cetera. And so, the training that we offer on our portal is our sales process, right? We've found success and we lay out the process for the sales cycle. And then they see a model by their managers and their field trainers. So we want them to have access to that in that period of time where they're waiting on, you know, their exam results to go through. And so it's during that recruiting pipeline where they've said, yes, the office is engaged with them like the recruiting offices engaged with them and they, to help keep them engaged, they'll put them into the LMS as external users and they have access to a specific set of training that some of it's required in order for them to make sales. And some of it is developmental.\nTIM\n11:46 \nGotcha. So, would your… with the business believe that like that's a very critical aspect of their onboarding is, I mean, that's gotta be critical to the business, right? Right? And do you have like a success and fail ratio of like people who come into the system but don't ever Pan out to get in? And.\nJENNIFER\n12:11 \nI don't track it. I'm sure recruiting has numbers but they don't like where they drop out in the process. I don't know where they would start to measure that because they could drop out before they achieve their, you know, like maybe the exams are too hard to get licensed with the state.\nAbout Docebo\nJENNIFER\n12:25 \nThey don't pass the background check. You know, they definitely have like attrition numbers there. And then we know… even once we get them contracted.\nTIM\n12:35 \nThere's a failure.\nJENNIFER\n12:36 \nMost of them don't last, right? Like the retention rate is extremely low in sales, but especially insurance sales, I think.\nTIM\n12:44 \nOkay.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJENNIFER\n12:46 \nThat's our highest turnover is that.\nTIM\n12:49 \nSo, they pass the exam, they're in, they start to sell. And then they, that's when they start to turn over that's when they start to leave… they don't make it through.\nJENNIFER\n13:02 \nYeah, because it's 100 percent commission and, you know, the most people, most of our recruiters came from a different career path or college and so they have zero work experience and it's just hard. It's a lot of rejection. So, yeah, usually if you can make it to 90 days, your retention rate is much higher, but 90 days is pretty critical for the success of a intern.\nTIM\n13:30 \nGotta have a few in the well already for you. Okay? All right. Yeah. I was just wondering how that worked out.\nCHRISTINE\n13:39 \nSorry to jump in like from the C, no perspective internally, that is another Audience and they use the system completely different and that's for internal compliance training. And then… there's also like subset of different divisions that use it for like the testing and, you know, more of the actual like learning behaviors and the soft training. So… they're not prioritize, you know, because it's not business critical, but that is part of the functionality you know, that we'll be looking for.\nTIM\n14:19 \nOkay.\nCHRISTINE\n14:20 \nThey tend to get easily overlooked right now.\nTIM\n14:24 \nAlways, right? It's always the ones that they're trying to keep in there now it.\nTIM\n14:34 \nSo… the, you know, I was looking through because I wrote down like some of the things that were jamming you up from, I have like multiple notes here. So I apologize. So if you see me typing it's because I try to keep as copious notes as I possibly can, but… it was really that you're… a lot of the stuff just doesn't come together, right? It's not integrated. So you can have something here but you can't have it there. Like the one for instance, was underneath your learning plan, being able to have like a file repository. So just where they can go back to that… what is the, I keep going back to your, we felt like we're stuck. So that was it what's the thing that you think that will prompt, you know, your team to make a move? Like what would possibly make them to say, you know, what that's the, that makes sense to me to make a move… you know, to a new system?\nJENNIFER\n15:46 \nI mean, the cost would be the easiest one, but I think from our own department. So those that service the consumer sales people… the ability to offer like better programs. So right now, we're pretty limited in like if you're designing a new program for, from scratch or even just updating one, like we pretty much know the limitations of Cornerstone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • The learners are mostly internal with some external ones who will eventually become internal.  \n• There is a separate recruiting system and department for leads, which helps keep recruits engaged in their waiting period before taking licensing exams by giving them access to training on the portal about sales processes. \n• Internal compliance training is also offered as well as testing and soft training for certain divisions; however this tends to be overlooked due to it not being business critical. \n• Jennifer believes that cost or offering better programs than those currently available on Cornerstone would prompt her team into making a move towards another system END"}
{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n16:15 \nAnd so, yeah, the idea that you can't have a file repository, the idea that if you're gonna put supplementary videos related to the program, they need to go into a separate system. So the blended… programs, learning programs that we prefer to do where we wanna make the most impact.\nLearning Plans ends\nJENNIFER\n16:37 \nIt's just tough to string that together in a cohesive way. But I mean, I think all I need to say is that like for accurate record keeping or ease of… data transmission between our systems, you know, we could solve any of our back end headaches of like Cornerstone is not a day one system for the C, no folks. It's a day three at this point system. And so like the onboarding experience sucks, you know, that would help the HR folks get on board.\nTIM\n17:15 \nWhen you say it's not a day one system. I.\nJENNIFER\n17:18 \nIt has to do with the way that we integrated it, it's basically on purpose and it's not even like a Cornerstone limitation but just understanding better how the systems get set up and having the excuse to start over. So that wouldn't be like a system requirement that's just something I would pitch as a reason for doing the work of setting up a new. Otherwise we're like on, in the back log like maybe 15 initiatives down.\nTIM\n17:48 \nNever.\nx\nPricing\nMICHAEL\n22:14 \nDoing great. See you're doing great.\nTIM\n22:18 \nYeah. So, okay. So I'm not sure how… Cornerstone is set up, but a lot of software companies have a named user that, that's how they do their pricing. And with a named user model, if Tim Marsh is in the system, you pay for Tim Marsh when I leave and Michael kink comes on to take me over. You now say it, can you move this license over to Michael kink? But then you lose all of my information, right? Common problem. We use what we call a monthly active user model. Now, the difference is this is that you can have as many registered users as you want. Now, there's some benefits to having an unlimited registered users. For some people who have like seasonal employees, you can just keep them in there forever and they just sit there. But you also, if somebody maybe comes into the system comes in and, you know, just in this scenario you talked about is maybe they started the process to get their, to get certified, but then they stopped and then they came back and said, hey, I wanna do this again. You don't lose any of that information. Okay? It stays there forever. And the nice thing about the CEO, a lot of companies have what they call dormant user fee. So you pay a certain amount. And if you go over that, you can keep them but you have to pay every year, dormant user fee. We don't do that. You can have as many registered users as you want. And now you only pay for the actual active users. That's the reason I asked last time about how many are actually going in and engaging in content into the, in the system that's all that's the only people that you will pay for. Okay? Does that make sense? Yeah.\nPricing ends\nJENNIFER\n24:13 \nWe actually, we have that for our video service provide.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •Jennifer discussed the difficulty of having a file repository, noting that blended learning programs need to be structured in a cohesive way.\n• Jennifer also mentioned their video service provider has similar features for pricing. END"}
{"prompt":"TIM\n24:18 \nOkay, perfect. So then you get that. So… we get a lot of great feedback on it just because it really gives you that flexibility and you can have as many users in there. And if somebody leaves and then comes back, you don't lose all that historical data. So it really helps protect you from, for compliance. And if there's you know, sexual passed Osha training anything, any type of training, you always have that sitting in there. So this way to protect you from lawsuits and, you know, that sort. So, so when you go back in and you look at your actual platform and I know that Cornerstone where you're I just got off of another call with going through, I wanna have you guys talk and you guys can be our biggest champion on G2, but they were talking about how getting that data of their actual active users. It's they're still waiting on November and December to get that data from Cornerstone. Just so you know, you get that data in the system. So we provide that to, you know, real time. So you can see that we actually in your admin… in the admin profile, you'll actually have a calendar up there.\nPricing\nTIM\n25:28 \nSo this way, you know, exactly where you are, you know, what you're paying for. So this way there's no surprises, you know, exactly what you have, and we typically go in 505 100 increments, meaning a 1,000, 1,500, 2000 and so on. Okay. Where do you, where do you believe you are? I know you had said 15,000, you know, users.\nCHRISTINE\n25:49 \nRight on the spot is right around like 100 more or less about.\nTIM\n25:56 \nOkay. We're in around 15,000 that are actually hitting the system.\nCHRISTINE\n26:01 \nIt's literally 15,100, right?\nTIM\n26:03 \nOkay.\nJENNIFER\n26:04 \nThose are active, but they're not in the system. The, that number is closer to 4,000.\nTIM\n26:13 \nOkay. Yeah.\nJENNIFER\n26:15 \nSo, like 5,000 users are one portion of our brands, it's specifically brokers, and if they go into the system, it's to complete one module in their entire career and they'll never go back. So 5,000 people just taking up space, another, you know, 3,000 are maybe vendors and contingent workers that do not actually have to take our training, but because other systems are hard, like they shouldn't even be sent to the LMS?\nTIM\n26:49 \nThat they…\nJENNIFER\n26:49 \nAre, so they just sit there and they never go in there. We might assign them stuff on accident and then need to remove it. But yeah, the people that are actually interacting with the system probably on a month to month basis, it's closer to 4,000. We could say five to be safe.\nTIM\n27:04 \nOkay. All right, perfect. So that's great. So now we know, so what we can do then is talk to you about… talk to you about actual pricing on let's say 5,000 users, just so you guys have a good idea of what that looks like. And then what we would wanna do is, you know, talk about the, you know, the different… modules that we believe will work for you.\nCoach & Share\nTIM\n27:33 \nMost of what I believe we showed you was in the, is just our learn platform, right? So there really wasn't much outside of that. We do have content that we can provide as well. There is the one… social aspect of this that we have which is discover coach and share, which where you can set up channels for brokers, you can set up that we showed you that's the only thing that's additional that to… what we showed you the other day.\nCoach & Share ends\nTIM\n28:08 \nAll right. Obviously, there's more that we could do in terms of there's other modules like our learning analytics and our learning insights and things like… that can show you the impact that trainings having they're additional. But everything you saw the other day, there was only two things that we showed you.\nCoach & Share\nTIM\n28:25 \nOne was our learn MS which was at 99 percent of it. And then the other piece was that discover coach and share, which was a there's that social aspect where you can have channels and you can have subject matter experts, load in content. There, does that make sense? Is there anything else that we, you wanted us to price out for you content, additional content, things like that?\nIntegrations\nJENNIFER\n28:51 \nNo, I mean we talked about potentially there'd be… something else worth looking at, but no, I mean as it stands right now, we could just go with that.\nTIM\n29:03 \nYeah, I'm just making sure I…\nTIM\n29:10 \nYeah, there was, there, there are a couple of things from an integration standpoint, if you, where, what do you have like a CRM that you pull from like Salesforce or anything like that?\nIntegrations ends\nTIM\n29:22 \nWhere do you keep your potential brokers? Things like that? Is there anything you're gonna integrate with just wanna give you ballpark pricing anyway.\nJENNIFER\n29:29 \nThe only integration we have today is LinkedIn learning for content?\nTIM\n29:34 \nOkay.\nJENNIFER\n29:34 \nAnd that's a separate contract. So we just need to keep that.\nTIM\n29:38 \nYeah. Yeah. And we…\nIntegrations\nJENNIFER\n29:39 \nYeah, no, I mean, so what we're using today, I think was native to LMS. So the APIs… we're using.\nTIM\n29:48 \nOpen cornerstones.\nJENNIFER\n29:50 \nActive and reporting APIs for different systems.\nTIM\n29:57 \nYou guys… Tableau, right? Domo?\nJENNIFER\n30:03 \nSo, we use Domo actually, we have the connector like somebody wrote up how to read the reporting APIs to make Domo work for us. But Tableau that's just a flat file that we send to FTP and it collects. So I don't know if we'd have the demand for and resources for setting up like day one to set up Tableau, and we wanna pass that.\nTIM\n30:24 \nWe have open APIs anyway. So they could always recommend to do that.\nPricing\nTIM\n30:28 \nOkay, perfect. All right, then I think I have everything for you. So… the… for 5,000 users, it's 80, but 84,000, it's actually 83,995 that's for our learning platform. If you add on the discover coach and share it's, 33,598.\nPricing ends\nTIM\n30:58 \nThat's a social aspect… that's the price right there. Now we do, there are like if there's some connectors and some things that we had on like there's a sandbox that I would encourage people to get… you know, when I worked at Oracle, everybody had to buy a sandbox.\nMobile App\nTIM\n31:22 \nI recommended it's. Only 5,000 dollars. It's you know, what I would recommend? And then if you want a mobile branded app… like where we give you a free one, which is our, you know, which is ours. But if you want to go in and they want them to search and say it to be an apple or the android play store and you say, yeah, you want it to be branded for Bankers, it would be 16,050 dollars.\nPricing\nJENNIFER\n31:55 \nAnd all that's annual.\nTIM\n31:57 \nThe annual price, right? We can, we'll put this together in a document and send it over to you will also include the, what I'm about to show you for the onboarding piece of it. And, you know, I'm trying to just give you a big picture here of, you know, what it looks like? How does that, how does that work within your budget?\nJENNIFER\n32:23 \nThat's under, I think our base right now… what's the term on the like is that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Tim provided pricing information for 5,000 users of their learning platform at $83,995 and an additional 33,598 for the discover coach and share social aspect.\n• Integrations with other systems such as Salesforce or Domo were discussed in order to provide more features.\n• A mobile app can be purchased for 16,050 dollars annually if desired.\n• Onboarding was also mentioned as part of the overall package that will be sent over in a document outlining all costs. END"}
{"prompt":"TIM\n41:02 \nSure.\nJENNIFER\n41:03 \nImplementation…\nTIM\n41:05 \nThey can do, you know, a state real work for, you know, get you in to tell you exactly what it is. I like you to know what baseline is like, hey, we're gonna do this no matter what this is, what it is, what the cost is for that. So this way you have a starting point. So this way we don't say well, you know, and you're also getting this, you know, with the, you know, what you're going to get no matter what. And that's what most of our customers go with. Okay? But most of our customers aren't you, right?\nOnboarding\nTIM\n41:34 \nSo you're unique. So we wanna make sure that we give you that the abilities to add on. And I feel like we've done a really good job over the past year. We've changed up the way that we do our services, where we offer a lot more hands on services, project management services.\nOnboarding ends\nTIM\n41:50 \nSo there's a lot of things that they can add on that some of the holes that customers have, we took a lot of the feedback that we got from customers after the onboarded, they said, hey, it would have been nice if we could have had this even if we had to pay for it. If we did this. And they've added that on. Cool. So questions, we hit you with a lot in a little bit of time there.\nTIM\n42:17 \nIt means I'm very thorough or… Christine just doesn't have her voice. I'm gonna take a set because…\nCHRISTINE\n42:29 \nYeah, I actually did for a little bit, so, but very, yeah, very, I don't have any questions right now.\nPricing\nMICHAEL\n42:38 \nOkay. Well, how do you guys feel about everything? How does this all, you know?\nJENNIFER\n42:44 \nGood. I mean, so, yeah. So like I said, the per user cost is higher, but it's a different model. So I don't feel like there's any concerns there? An overall having features that we're paying Cornerstone extra for already baked in that's where you'll make up on cost… you know, for us, the sandbox is like… of course, we have to have one currently with quartersone, we have the three environments.\nPricing ends\nJENNIFER\n43:12 \nSo that made me think like what do you guys do to roll out new features? Like is there like a trial period for your customers to like adopt, you know, if you're making significant changes to the system, especially if you didn't have the sandbox?\nTIM\n43:27 \nYeah. Typically, most of our customers get a sandbox and that's where they would test that out. We try to do monthly small enhancements that, and try not to do those wholesale ones. But your account manager will also talk to you about that. Plus we, there's right inside our community, we make sure that we're giving you the updates ahead of time. Hey, this is come. So we like to, you know, foreshadow. So this way you're not like what just happened. You know, so try to plan that out as well.\nJENNIFER\n43:57 \nYep. And then to refresh that sandbox, is that like a statement of work to go back to, you know, matching production… limit to how many times we could do that?\nTIM\n44:11 \nThat's a good question. I can find out for you on that.\nJENNIFER\n44:15 \nWe, we try to get better about testing our program configurations before deploying them.\nTIM\n44:23 \nYeah, that's smart.\nMICHAEL\n44:26 \nJust to make sure I understand what you guys are asking, you guys are asking how many times we could reset the sandbox to have it start from scratch or match production site, or match your production site? Okay?\nJENNIFER\n44:36 \nAnd that if there's a cost and, or lead time, just knowing that would help.\nTIM\n44:43 \nThat's a good question. Actually, I'll I've never had actually anybody asked me that here. I used to get asked all the time of an Oracle. That was probably my number one. And I've never had anyone ask me that. So I…\nPricing\nJENNIFER\n44:57 \nI mean, I've noticed since taking this job, it's not normal to treat L and D like it in a project management fashion. So.\nTIM\n45:07 \nYeah.\nJENNIFER\n45:08 \nI can see that.\nTIM\n45:10 \nFor sure.\nJENNIFER\n45:11 \nAnd then annual increase in pricing. Do you have an idea of like historically what you, when you go to renegotiate about how much that changes?\nTIM\n45:21 \nYeah. So typically, that's why we bake in… the three years. So is your, you're locked in for the three years and that gives you that. And then from there, the largest increase that we had over which we didn't do for I think was the first time in five years was in 2022 there was a seven percent increase from 2021 pricing. Obviously, that didn't impact anyone that was already in contract. So that was the lift that we had.\nOnboarding\nJENNIFER\n45:54 \nOkay… cool.\nTIM\n45:57 \nSo in terms of your next steps… what I'd like to do is obviously have you talk to our to Steph and our Professional services team to really answer a lot more of those roll out questions and onboarding questions. But also she's got she'll, have a lot of questions for you in terms of your resource, you know, what you have from a resource perspective where we can plug some of the holes and then she can get you a statement of work and then you'd have really the most of the picture painted for you. So this way I like to give everybody upfront. So this way there's no surprises yep your.\nJENNIFER\n46:40 \nYeah. So by the end of March, my goal to have brought the governance committee back together and make some real progress on our objectives for this exercise.\nTIM\n46:52 \nOkay.\nJENNIFER\n46:53 \nSo then my expectation would be I could check back in with you all in April based on the results of that and where it's looking like we're going my… already said plan to share the recording because I think that will help kick start that exercise since I think a lot of the people that we're working with haven't, ever even been through a significant RFP. So just to get them on board, but yeah, April to see kind of like what the temperature of the water is, and maybe game plan from there right now.\nOnboarding ends\nJENNIFER\n47:29 \nI'm a pretty cynical person by nature. So I'm just expecting the worst and that it's going to be is log but you never know it's…\nCHRISTINE\n47:37 \nBalance, we balance each other out because I'm like go to and like… not happen.\nTIM\n47:44 \nWe got this Jen, no, we don't Christine.\nJENNIFER\n47:47 \nWe really don't but yeah, so then from there, we'll know and I don't like to because I am such a strategic like granular planner. I don't like to bake those ideas out too far until I know, yeah, just what we're dealing with because there is always the chance that we decide this makes sense for us and then we abandon, you know.\nTIM\n48:11 \nI feel, yeah, I've been through that as well. So how can we help you with the governance committee there? Because there's a few things we could do?\nJENNIFER\n48:21 \nI feel like you already have the strength of that demo. I really feel like we focused on the features that group is most familiar with and cares most about. We have already because we retain all of our records from the last time we did an RFP and landed on Cornerstone, you know, so we're not starting from scratch with them, but it's not the same group of people.\nUser Permission\nJENNIFER\n48:44 \nSo just leveling up some that have not been through this at all and then resetting that team to just even have them understand what their role is like, you know, if we allow instructional designers to come along on this journey… their per view is limited, you know, little things like that to get them set.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jennifer discussed her goals for bringing the governance committee back together by the end of March and checking in come April based on their results. END"}
{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n49:05 \nBut like when we loaded this idea, it was basically like, yeah, everybody's too busy with their other initiatives that they would not be able to spend the time here. So that's my biggest thing is, can we make this something that you all can spend time on? And then if not go from there, and then I just, I don't know that that's something that you'll be able to impact but that you already have just by, you know, having something we're looking at?\nCHRISTINE\n49:33 \nI think I've got cno, I think I've got, I know, Aaron.\nJENNIFER\n49:38 \nHe doesn't pay.\nCHRISTINE\n49:39 \nAnyone?\nJENNIFER\n49:41 \nThat's true. No, I think we can get every individual.\nTIM\n49:47 \nAs many champions as possible. It sounds like, right?\nJENNIFER\n49:50 \nYeah, to find someone that will actually help us find an executive sponsor that… will help… because what I, the other side of this is like you said, plugging the holes like there are some that we won't be able to work around like we just, we have to make this a priority for our, the agile team that does our ETL work.\nOnboarding\nJENNIFER\n50:11 \nYou know, they would minimally have to be involved in order to switch over, you know, just jobs that we have running to, you know, the very granular detail that has to happen there, but they'll have to be involved from the beginning and we'll have to use project hours for them. Everybody's already, you know, allocated their project hours for these different it teams. So the sooner I can start on that and, you know, have a decent, I feel like I'm throwing the executive sponsors, potential executive sponsor into the bust. There's just some that would be more useful than others.\nOnboarding ends\nTIM\n50:45 \nFor sure, we've all been through that. What are your instructional designers use today for their using?\nJENNIFER\n50:53 \nIt's almost exclusively Articulate 360 because we're bring our own device shop. We tried to land somewhere in the middle of, you know, usability and design. So the Storyline 360 is pretty much the baseline they've used rise, but that can get weird with certain oss. Historically we've tried Captivate, and somebody else I can't remember. And yeah, I think just my own personal opinion is that Storyline is extremely easy to learn and use it so simple.\nTIM\n51:39 \nJust thinking like structure for them doesn't really matter as long as it plays what they want, right?\nCHRISTINE\n51:46 \nHey, Jen, they cut us out of their content, right? Like I feel like.\nJENNIFER\n51:51 \nAnd this, so we've been going back and forth with them because, yeah, like we do some functional testing, like if we load your course onto the LMS and we can't earn a completion… it's not the LMS like the LMS already told you how you need to, you know, scorm, something similar, you know, scorm, they prefer 2004 third edition, the X API. We never even tested because that would take time and require, you know, those guys to learn a few new triggers. So, yeah, that's just been a bit of a political.\nMICHAEL\n52:23 \nI…\nTIM\n52:24 \nNeed all of that. We're agnostic. So.\nJENNIFER\n52:25 \nRight, exactly.\nTIM\n52:27 \nFor that as well, 2004. So for the scoring as well. So.\nJENNIFER\n52:32 \nWell, there's a perception that it's the LMS that is restraining or constraining their creativity, but it's not, it's really, it comes down to like the user experience and like how easily and consistently a wide variety of people and devices can interact with the same, like hot button, right? And so that's not really a tool issue and it's not an LMS issue. It's like how you designed it. But we were asked to put two designers on the larger committee several months ago and I think I need to make the case that that's probably not appropriate. Well, really.\nOnboarding\nCHRISTINE\n53:13 \nTactically though they should be on board.\nJENNIFER\n53:16 \nYeah, I mean, no, there's no reason that they, but yeah, any of the user experience, I catch it questions and configurations.\nTIM\n53:26 \nJust…\nJENNIFER\n53:27 \nNot even for.\nTIM\n53:31 \nWell, you let us know how we can help… at any point. You want us to circle back, you wanna put something on the books for April or I mean, we can skip over March.\nOnboarding ends\nJENNIFER\n53:42 \nObviously.\nTIM\n53:44 \nWe're we're available. We're here. So if you need something from us in March, even if you wanna do an, you know, an ad hoc demo on something better, get deeper into the admin side, I know you have some things that you need to do ahead of that, but let us know. I mean, we're here. We wanna make sure that we give you all the info you need. We can also provide what we call it a microsite. It's like it gives you like a bit of a sizzle of what you saw in that demo. If for those who don't have the attention span to go through an entire demo.\nNext Steps\nJENNIFER\n54:26 \nOkay. Yeah, we'll certainly let you know.\nTIM\n54:29 \nI send it over to you. If you like it, you can load it around and we can go from there. Sound good?\nCHRISTINE\n54:35 \nSure.\nJENNIFER\n54:36 \nAnd then, yeah, let's maybe say April 20 seventh for a touch point. We've got some stuff launching in April that I think is gonna make me… a little bit crazy. So in end of April to, okay… get back together.\nWrap-Up\nTIM\n54:54 \nIt'll be one week after my shoulder surgery. So hopefully, and it's I'll be, we're using my left hand, so hopefully I'll be able to operate.\nJENNIFER\n55:04 \nFun.\nTIM\n55:06 \nCan't wait? Okay? This has been great. Hopefully, we provided you with all the information you need. Let us know from a pricing perspective. You know, if you have more questions or anything, we can clarify and we'll go from there. Awesome. Thank… you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jennifer discussed the need to make onboarding a priority for their agile team.\n• Christine and Tim suggested finding multiple champions and using Articulate 360 as an instructional design tool. \n• Jennifer noted that there is a perception of constraints from the LMS, but it really comes down to user experience design. \n• Christine tactically suggested getting designers on board with this project. \n• Tim offered resources such as demo information, microsite access, or pricing questions if needed in order to help Jennifer achieve her goals by April 20th when she has other projects launching simultaneously.

Yeah, yeah, it'll be a lot of fun. It'll be a healthy mix of like playing hockey and just like sitting by the pool, this is recording, but, you know what I mean? Yeah, I'll make sure I have to cut this part of the recording out. If I send over the recording from today's, call, remind me of that.\nNICK\n3:31 \nAnyway, yeah, it'll be a lot of fun.\nMATT\n3:37 \nGood, good.\nNICK\n3:46 \nHello?\nKATLYN\n3:50 \nHi, you.\nNICK\n3:50 \nHow you doing?\nKATLYN\n3:52 \nDoing well. Thanks, hope you guys are.\nNICK\n3:56 \nYeah, we were just talking about the weather. It's awfully warm up here in Toronto today, I.\nKATLYN\n4:00 \n14.\nNICK\n4:00 \nDegrees. Yeah, that would.\nKATLYN\n4:02 \nProbably about probably.\nNICK\n4:03 \nAbout 60 for the fahrenheit.\nKATLYN\n4:06 \nNice. Yeah, it's like 75.\nNICK\n4:09 \nHere today.\nMATT\n4:09 \nI…\nKATLYN\n4:10 \nHaven't been outside much yet, but my first meeting was eight am, so I can plan to sit out on the patio from like seven to eight having, you know, coffee and stuff, and, but it's like 47 degrees in the morning. Like, why are we acting like it's already warm when it's not gonna warm out to like three, so.\nNICK\n4:31 \nYeah, yeah. I know what you mean. It's interesting in Toronto because it'll be like 14 degrees on a day like this, which is like beautiful spring weather. It's where I thrive to be honest. But then the wind chill makes it just super cold. Like I was standing up there on my balcony. And then a burst of wind just hits me and I'm like I wanna go back inside. This isn't fun for me anymore. But yeah, only a couple more, a full steam ahead on nicer weather.\nKATLYN\n4:59 \nYeah, we're getting the.\nNICK\n5:01 \nGood stuff. Well, yeah, just so today, some interesting news, Matt and I got some more approvals from our side of our side of things at Docebo upfront to be transparent.\nSmall Talk ends\nNICK\n5:14 \nThis is our best and final offer like this is kinda the best that we can do pricing wise. Not too much has changed in terms of like the actual dollar values themselves. But there have been some changes in… more so to speak like the structure of the pricing and how that's gonna work for you. So I'm just gonna go ahead and share my screen. I'll walk us through this. I know we got booked until three 30, but I don't think it's gonna take the full half hour for us to go through this and I just kinda move these Zoom bars here on my screen so I can see this. Okay. But Katlyn, what we're looking at here is just the two solutions that we spoke about. So this, it's very similar to the acceleration package is the exact same price, however you'll probably notice that it doesn't include Docebo Shape, which is something that comes with the acceleration package. However, it's a tool that we, I don't even think we talked about it to be honest, and I don't really see it being a massive differentiator in your use case from Docebo. So it's not a big deal that we have to leave it out here. But really the reason why we did have to is because it was the only way for us to get the second part of pricing approved, which is what I'm gonna show you shortly.\nPricing\nNICK\n6:22 \nBut again, what we're looking at here is just yearly signing on with up to 500 monthly active users at around 27,000 with an onboarding plan of eight weeks at 5,000.\nKATLYN\n6:35 \nYou remind me what do Shape was again?\nNICK\n6:38 \nIt's just, it's like an AI powered content creation tool, so you could take something like a PDF and put it into Shape and it would spit out like a two or three minute video.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n6:47 \nSome people use it. I mean, it's interesting, but it's you know, again, not something that we spoke too highly about. I don't think it will be super relevant to your project.\nKATLYN\n6:57 \nDoes it still include your four sovereign tool?\nNICK\n7:01 \nYeah, like you can build courses and stuff like that through it. Just, it doesn't have the Shape tool itself… into the contracting terms here.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n7:13 \nOkay. And how much is Shape if we want to add that on later?\nNICK\n7:16 \nIt's about 7,500 per year.\nKATLYN\n7:20 \nOkay. Gotcha. Thank you.\nNICK\n7:25 \nYeah, no worries at all. But in terms of, you know, like this contract here and what we're about to show you, so again, this has been approved until the end of the month.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n7:37 \nAnd I know when we had spoken a couple of weeks ago talking about timelines, a couple more things. We have to do just a demo with your CEO and then obviously figuring out the connect stuff with Spence if you wanted to move forward. But again, this has been approved until February 20 eighth.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n7:51 \nAnd I just want to double check in terms of timeline that's something that's still realistic from your side of things, correct?\nKATLYN\n7:57 \nI mean, I'm really looking to be done shopping at this point, so.\nNICK\n8:01 \nOkay, perfect. And aside from that demo with your CEO and figuring out connect with Spence, is there, you know, going to be any legal review? Is there any financial review from your finance team? Anything along those lines or is it more just, hey, let's demo with your CEO, figure out connect short contract review and then signing an agreement?\nKATLYN\n8:22 \nAs far as legal review, I think the main thing that I'd be looking at in the contract is just verbiage that preserves our ownership over our content, which I'm assuming is not an issue in the contract. But when we're reading it, that's what we're gonna be looking for.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nick made Docebo's best offer for pricing which included two solutions at 27,000 yearly with 500 monthly active users plus an 8 week onboarding plan for 5,000 dollars - in addition, Docebo Shape which would be 7500 per year if added later on. \n• Katlyn asked about legal review of the contract to preserve ownership over their content before signing off agreement - Nick confirmed there should not be any issues regarding this matter within contract verbiage END"}
{"prompt":"MATT\n16:51 \nOff off hand?\nKATLYN\n16:53 \nLike are you talking about like the response time for tickets or… onboarding not coming through or something like of that nature.\nMATT\n17:04 \nThis is more if the software is down and not working.\nKATLYN\n17:07 \nOkay.\nMATT\n17:08 \nYes. Okay. It's not. I think where at the end of one year, you're like, I don't like it anymore and I want to get out… that's not… that's where it's being held as for three years, this is the commitment we've made.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n17:26 \nOkay. And then one of the things with our workflow that we talked about for subscriptions was that for eCommerce, if we work with stripe sea, we'd be able to handle the subscription workflow within Docebo without having to use an API integration. What kind of cost is going to be involved if we don't find that stripe sa, meets our needs, and we wanna go with Shopify, or we wanna use pay pal at the end of having to integrate. I think the prices we were looking at earlier on in the process for that, we're gonna be like 13 K. And I wanna make sure that we've talked about that piece as well… because I wanna sign on with the assumption that like we'd be able to subscribe clients within the platform with stripe sea… that could work, but it also has some variables.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n18:20 \nYeah. So I think in terms of connect, like what we can do is that maybe this is something you and I could talk about offline. They can connect into here in the case that you would need it in the future. However the way connect pricing works. So it's 7,500 for the initial connector or the only connector that you'll need to connect us with, you know, Shopify, for example, it's just a connect onboarding which is 5,500 additional to that.\nPricing\nNICK\n18:46 \nSo it's only 13 K in year one. And then it's 75 in years two and three for the connector itself. And also to one more thing Katlyn in terms of like the one year opt out clause, Matt set it right? I mean, it's not necessarily something that we're going to put into a contract or put into writing.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n19:03 \nHowever one of the ways, you know, we could perhaps make you more comfortable with the three years even if we did more validation within the platform. Like from your side of things, is there, I guess any nerves? Like are you curious if like doc is not going to meet expectations? Like what can we do from our side to make you more comfortable with making a decision without putting a one year opt in, into, right?\nKATLYN\n19:25 \nYeah, I think so. I think having some time in the trial portal would be helpful especially just like even just now to the end of February making sure that we have some trial time to make sure that, you know, just answer the usability questions.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n19:44 \nBut honestly, what it comes down to is that I think that over the next couple of years that MS are going to become more friendly towards clients that are not using the product for internal corporate onboarding and are seeking to bring on external train external clients and use moditizer content, offer recurring subscriptions.\nPayment Gateway ends\nKATLYN\n20:11 \nAnd I think we're gonna see like this is just my guess but I think we're gonna see like the features and the usability of that get friendlier in the near term. And yeah, I mean Docebo is a leader in the space you guys have like quality tool. I do not wanna like diminish what you guys have created because it's truly impressive. However right now, most of your clients if I'm understanding correctly from my research are corporations that seek to train their internal employees on, you know, product knowledge, soft skills, compliance. They're not monetizing that content and it's kind of blended to the situation we're looking at, which is okay, we can do subscriptions within Docebo but only with this one third party vendor, right? So I foresee the space improving those workflows over the next couple of years. And I just don't love the idea of being walked into a three year.\nNICK\n21:08 \nTract…\nKATLYN\n21:09 \nWhen our use case is kind of like stretching what Docebo can do for Automatic recurring subscriptions for external clients. So my hope would be that you guys continue to be a front runner in that space.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n21:26 \nBut three years is, you know, within the next three years, we'll see who kinda like pops in and makes it really easy for people to monetize their content.\nMATT\n21:39 \nRight. I think it's these are probably better questions for Spence to come in and provide the technical expertise on where that is and what we're looking at from a stripe and Shopify standpoint. If you work with stripe, you can work with Shopify and vice versa. Shopify payment gateways is based on stripe. Shopify owns part of stripe. It's where I came from. I spent four years at Shopify before I came here and, but we need for that just goes outside like my level of understanding of how this all works.\nPayment Gateway ends\nMATT\n22:14 \nWe need Spence to come in and explain that exactly… this was today is just more of like… can we stay in the running based on the pricing that we've provided you?\nKATLYN\n22:26 \nRight. Yeah. And I appreciate that only more expenses time if we don't need to. I think that would just kinda maybe speak to maybe one of the things that would hold me back when I'm thinking like, okay, we're going to be using this tool for three years in three years.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n22:42 \nYou know, I certainly envision us a, having more than 3,000 users and so, but I appreciate you guys, you know, showing me that structure. It's not a problem… but our use case being more complex and wanting to use tools that make it really easy for… monetization and subscriptions.\nPayment Gateway ends\nKATLYN\n23:04 \nSo your platform can do it. And it's more just if… not just. But normally, when we choose a vendor, we don't sign a three year contract because needs can change over time and it's important to stay with who is the front one space and make sure that still meeting the needs.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n23:27 \nSo to Absorb there half the price I have a one year opt out on the three year contract. Gives me like that little room. And if I do have to integrate with a third party vendor outside of the platform, it's only like 1,100 dollars instead of like 13 K, which feels like a big difference. Could you clarify something for me, Nick, you said with Docebo connect, it's like 5,500 dollars setup year one and then 7,500 each year. Is there what's the reason that it recurs the charge every year? Is it assuming that there's other integrations that are occurring?\nIntegrations\nKATLYN\n24:08 \nOr do you have or it feels like for us to set up a third party vendor for eCommerce that would be like a one time setup. So I just wanted to clarify why Docebo connect would charge the 7,500 on an annual basis?\nNICK\n24:25 \nYeah. I mean, for the most part, it's managed through Docebo. It's similar to our software, right? Like we have maintenance cost on the software, which is why we charge what we charge. Also because of the way that we position in the market with, you know, very strong product. It's gonna cost a little bit more. Connects basically is a white labeled Workato. However, it's all just managed through Docebo aside from setting up the recipe, which is basically like the coding between connect and Shopify, which again is why we would charge for onboarding because we're hands on when it comes to setting that up. But again, it's part of a managed service. I mean, you could set up the integration yourself through something like a Workato, maybe even using stuff like API calls if you wanted to get creative with it. However why we have the direct recipe with Shopify because either people don't have the resources to put together that connector themselves, or they'd rather have something you know, trusted through the LMS platform that's gonna facilitate that super easily for them. So, I mean it's completely up to you, right? Like you could connect with Shopify without needing a connector. I'm 90 percent sure. I'll get expense to validate that. However if you did just want it to be easy to manage, that's why we have connect.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matt and Katlyn discussed the response time for tickets, onboarding not coming through, and software being down.\n• Katlyn expressed concern about signing into a 3-year contract when their use case is complex regarding monetizing content externally with recurring subscriptions.  \n• Nick explained that Docebo Connect is managed through them as it would be easier than setting up an integration via API calls or Workato; however this comes at an additional cost of 7500 each year for onboarding plus 5500 initially for connecting to Shopify etcetera. END"}
{"prompt":"KATLYN\n25:40 \nOkay. I think that's one of the areas that's just a little fuzzy for me is whether or not we need to have the connect and if we do then that's an additional like quite a bit of cost like it's an additional 13 K in year one and then, you know, more or two or three.\nIntegrations ends\nKATLYN\n25:58 \nSo if we could just put our finger on if we really need that or not, I think that would help. So really those are my, those are the main three things that I have to contemplate is if we move forward with them, even though I love your social learning platform, it's still twice the cost of Absorb.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n26:18 \nWe would also have less more risk, you know, less, you know, bubble wrap because it'll be a three year contract and there's no one year opt out I and a little ambiguity on if we need to connect and knowing that would cost an additional 13 K. So if we were able to solve two of those three problems, if we were able to solve the one year opt out with a three year or, and if we were able to like feel pretty comfortable that we either wouldn't need Docebo connect or would be able if it was like a nominal price like what Absorb is charging.\nPricing ends\nKATLYN\n26:58 \nAnd then it's just not then it's just a non issue. I think that would make it a little bit easier to move forward. Knowing that when we do, we're committing to twice the cost of the other competitor.\nNICK\n27:12 \nOkay. Okay. That works. So, so why don't, we do this in terms of next steps? Let's potentially set up a call with Spence to go through connect, you know, really kind of button down and see if that is something that you'd need. In the case that it is, we can talk about cost and that's something that Matt and I can potentially chat about offline when the timing's right?\nKATLYN\n27:36 \nAnd…\nNICK\n27:37 \nThen also too with that call in Spence, I think again going back to what I was saying earlier with the one year opt out, it's not something we do unfortunately. However there are maybe some things that we can do from the solution side of things, right? Working with Spence, getting you comfortable with the platform, maybe talking about our road map and how we plan on improving the external training side of things. Just so in three years, you know, I mean, I'm fairly confident to say we're still going to be a market leader in that space. And if that is a way that the market starts trending, I'm sure Docebo would like to go towards that direction as well. It's just a matter of getting maybe you some documentation that, you know, would make you more comfortable, make the CEO more comfortable. So that three years from now… it's fair to say that we'd still be a leader in that space. Does that sound like a fair plan for next steps?\nKATLYN\n28:27 \nYeah. And I think I would just add that Matt, I know it's important to you that we're not like spinning wheels here and that we're not using Spence time if we don't really need to.\nWrap-Up\nKATLYN\n28:36 \nSo if you want to start by just like chatting with Spence and seeing like if you can, he knows more about integrations and API than I do. And if we can just boil it down to like whether I need to connect or not, that would help. And if he has follow up questions, I'm always happy to hop on a call but I also want to be your special.\nWrap-Up ends\nMATT\n28:58 \nYeah. Yeah, that's a better plan. Let's figure this out… because if you need it, it's gonna cost that much. There's that much of a discrepancy from Absorb. I think I know what the answer is going to be.\nKATLYN\n29:17 \nYeah. So like let's put our finger on if we really need it or not or if stripe sea is likely sufficient. And then I can do research on my end to see if I have any qualms about using stripe sea.\nWrap-Up\nMATT\n29:28 \nMakes sense.\nNICK\n29:29 \nYeah, that sounds good to me. So I'll touch base with Spence and I can't even speak today. In the meantime, Katlyn I'll email you over these numbers for, you know, for review, take into your CEO, let us know what they say and look to go from there.\nKATLYN\n29:46 \nOkay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Let me know if you have any questions.\nMATT\n29:49 \nOf course. Well, you.\nNICK\n29:50 \nTake care.\nKATLYN\n29:51 \nBye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Katlyn discussed the need to consider if they needed an additional cost of 13K in year one for a connect, as well as the risk of committing to a three-year contract with no opt out clause and some ambiguity on whether or not Docebo Connect was necessary.\n• The next steps were proposed by Nick - set up a call with Spence to discuss the connect, Matt and Nick will chat about cost offline when appropriate.\n• Katlyn also suggested getting more information from Spence regarding integrations/API before researching other options such as Stripe Sea.

So I'm glad you figured that out quickly, but my apologies.\nNICOLE\n0:37 \nYeah, no problem. And I know that there were a few others that did wanna be on the call today. I'm not sure if it didn't just end up working out for their availability, but I saw that you're recording the meeting, so that would be great for, you know, anything that we review today for me to share with them.

I have worked with a few different fitness brands at Docebo as well.\nSmall Talk ends\nCAROLINE\n1:18 \nIt always seems to be a really good fit. So I'm looking forward to hearing a little bit more about what you're wanting to accomplish and even more.

Yeah, we are, I don't know exactly what the time line is.\nSmall Talk\nNICOLE\n1:39 \nI know it's definitely this year, but yeah, we're super excited about that location to open up. So that's how coincidental that you are.\nCAROLINE\n1:47 \nRight around the corner. Well, it truly is coincidental because I'll tell you I'm the only one on the island out of all of Docebo and I don't think it was like planned that your lead came to me or anything like that.\nSmall Talk ends\nCAROLINE\n2:02 \nSo I'm super excited. So what I've learned so far is that you are quickly growing and you're currently using school, is that?\nANTONIETTA\n2:16 \nHow you pronounce it?\nNICOLE\n2:17 \nYes. And actually, before I answered that question, I actually had one of my team members.\nCAROLINE\n2:24 \nShe can't get back to.\nNICOLE\n2:25 \nMe, and just say like, hey, can you send me the Zoom link? So I wanna make sure that if she can join that, she is here.\nCAROLINE\n2:34 \nI just threw the link in the chat if you, yeah.\nNICOLE\n2:39 \nRight. Let me just pull that up really quickly because I know that there, it seems like there are a few people that are like…\nEMILY\n2:45 \nI wanna…\nNICOLE\n2:46 \nBe there.\nCAROLINE\n2:47 \nOkay. Cool. Yeah, no, I'd love the more, the merrier that's great.\nNICOLE\n2:50 \nOkay. Let me just send.\nEMILY\n2:51 \nThat over.\nNICOLE\n3:11 \nIt's not letting me copy it for some reason.\nCAROLINE\n3:14 \nThat's strange.\nNICOLE\n3:16 \nSo…\nCAROLINE\n3:17 \nIf you go to the three dots on the bottom… actually, sorry, if you go to participants, do you see that option at the bottom? There should be an invite button here.\nNICOLE\n3:31 \nGot…\nCAROLINE\n3:32 \nIt copy invite link, that will be the easiest one.\nEMILY\n3:37 \nOkay. Yeah.\nCAROLINE\n3:55 \nThere we go.

Well, maybe we can start with just some intros and there we go. Emily. Can you hear?\nEMILY\n4:28 \nI can hello.\nCAROLINE\n4:29 \nAwesome. Hey, Emily.\nNICOLE\n4:31 \nHey… Emily. I'd love your turtleneck today. Looks gorgeous.\nSmall Talk\nEMILY\n4:36 \nThanks. I'm in Chicago and it's like cold and rainy and nasty.\nNICOLE\n4:41 \nI…\nEMILY\n4:42 \nAnd I talked to my kids today in Atlanta and they're like it's going to be 80 degrees today, and I was like, yeah.\nNICOLE\n4:49 \nYeah.\nCAROLINE\n4:51 \nYeah. Hey, Antonietta.\nRJ\n4:56 \nHi.\nEMILY\n4:56 \nCaroline.\nCAROLINE\n4:58 \nNice. We got a full crew here. Hey, are…\nRJ\n5:06 \nWhat's going on? I guess.\nCAROLINE\n5:09 \nJust complaining about weather and so far, yeah.\nNICOLE\n5:16 \nActually…\nRJ\n5:18 \nBeautiful. Have some rain. We need rain. It be springs soon, so you can complain of ice to be in the green industry. So, rain has always been a good thing in my life for 15 years at least.\nNICOLE\n5:30 \nWell, Caroline has a fun fact to share with us about where she's located in our future evolved franchise location. Yeah.\nCAROLINE\n5:41 \nI'm in Victoria BC. Actually.\nRJ\n5:44 \nAll right.\nCAROLINE\n5:44 \nSo, super excited to have the opportunity to work with you guys.\nRJ\n5:51 \nStars are aligning?\nCAROLINE\n5:53 \nTotally. And I also have a bunch of friends who are into plates and bar and all that type of thing including myself. So, I'll definitely be shouting it from the rooftops. I know there will be a big group of people that are excited about it. So, yeah.\nRJ\n6:08 \nWe have a very passionate franchise out there. She's just like this. Everyone has to do this. I don't know why people aren't doing this. So I think she'll make some noise.\nSmall Talk ends\nCAROLINE\n6:17 \nAwesome. Well, I would love to, you know, if you decide to kinda move forward with evaluating Docebo. I'd love to meet her for a coffee as well. That'll be exciting. Awesome. Okay. Well, now that we've got everyone on board, I'd love to hear a little bit about what you're all responsible for at evolve. I did, I just fill in Nicole quickly that my job is an account executive here. So I help you evaluate if Docebo is going to be the right fit for your project. And I was sharing that I've actually worked with a lot of franchise organizations in the fitness space specifically. And so it's kind of a side passion of mine. And I've also been in the learning industry for quite some time. So working previously in corporate training and actually helping organizations build the training material. And now I've got to move over to the software space. So this is aligning a bunch of different passions for me. So looking forward to hearing what you all do, maybe we can start with you Nicole?\nNICOLE\n7:24 \nSure. Yeah. Well, I'm actually the most recent member to the team. This is my fourth week with evolve, but I am stepping into the role of leading our learning and development or one of the people that will be leading our learning and development for our instructors specifically. So, you know, everything from what they are going to receive an experience from a pre training perspective to once they are in the training, the type of learning and experiences that they're going to have in person and then and post training, everything that they're going to need to have their hands on, you know, after the training concludes. So we are definitely looking to explore a very robust LMS system to help us accomplish this. And I think, you know, Antonietta could definitely provide a little bit more color as to, you know, what she does as well as where we're at and where we're looking to go. She is my boss. So it would be great to kind of give her the floor and the opportunity to provide a little bit more color to what I just mentioned.\nCAROLINE\n8:35 \nLove it. Thanks.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nicole recently joined the company as a Learning and Development leader, responsible for pre-training, in-person training and post-training experiences for instructors.

{"prompt":"ANTONIETTA\n8:37 \nYeah, thanks, Nicole. So I'm Antonietta. I'm the chief training officer. So pretty much all things trainers for our digital on demand platform as well as in studio ladder up to me, I oversee kind of all of the business verticals that the trainers touch. So what we have right now we're on a system called schoolergy. It's been great for our three corporate locations and our one San Diego location. But, you know, we have a very ambitious goals in terms of how many franchises we are, you know, have signed and we'll sign pretty much. So we definitely need to work with something that's a little bit more sophisticated. We do have kind of a whole list that we compiled which maybe that could be useful to bring up just to kind of go through all of the line items. And, you know, in addition to scaling for the trainer, fitness side of things, we obviously want to be on the same system for the operational side as well. So Nicole and I are kind of fitness side. And then Emily and RJ are more, you know, the operations studio, team, studio coordinators, like the reception staff, studio managers, etcetera. So I'll pass the bucket to you, Emily.\nEMILY\n9:53 \nYeah, great. Intro. So basically, yeah, just like Antonietta said, you know, I handle sales and operations, the studio level. So we have three corporate own locations, currently, one franchise location that just opened and several in development. So, you know, what we're really looking for is a good seamless way to onboard, you know, new employees, new franchisees be able to update seamlessly to make sure that, you know, our, you know, operations manuals and things like that are always never obsolete, you know, as obviously newer growing brands, you know, we wanna make sure that we do have the ability to, among a lot of other things just to be able to update in, you know, real time. So we just never have obsolete, you know, information, right? But yeah. So I would just be kind of helping oversee like the content creation… for the learning and development on the sales and op side. So.\nCAROLINE\n10:56 \nAwesome. Awesome.\nEMILY\n10:57 \nAnd I got your name from not your name specifically, but the company I used to be with orange there. So core crane corporate gave me your information. So, yeah.\nAbout Docebo\nCAROLINE\n11:08 \nAwesome. Okay. That's great to hear.\nRJ\n11:11 \nThe vice president of franchise overseeing, franchise and studios. My background is franchising for the last 20 years we've done in my past, I've redone and operating manual for two different brands. And we also onboard into a new LMS in 29 2016 and then again in 2019.\nAbout Docebo ends\nRJ\n11:29 \nSo I'm a little bit dated. So it's been a little while, but, you know, definitely know the importance of the LMS for us to be able to scale. And, you know, as we're moving through our ambitious goals as we've said, we've got about 15 in development with three company on the studios. Our goal is to have over 200 units by 2025 so in order to scale this business the way we need to and want to, you know, we can continue to have more Emily's because we love her, but we need, you know, something more in technology that's going to allow for us to scale especially, you know, for, from the training side too. So we can kill two birds with one stone. It'd be phenomenal from the training perspective, as well as what we need from the student operations that'll be great. We have a laundry list of things that we want. We know we can't have it all, but we're interested to hear what we can.\nCAROLINE\n12:18 \nAble to have it all. I'd…\nNICOLE\n12:19 \nLove…\nRJ\n12:19 \nI'm looking at it, I don't know we put together last week, some a brainstorm some ideas of things that were must have and then some things that we're like to have. So we'd love to see a demo and then just, you know, we can ask her questions from there.\nCAROLINE\n12:35 \nYeah. Okay. Well, that sounds great. So I'll tell you my approach. I mean, first of all, it sounds like we've definitely got all the right people in the room. And actually, I wanted to make sure that I caught the number correctly. The goal is 300 franchise locations by 2025…\nRJ\n12:52 \nOver 200? Yeah, over 200, yeah.\nCAROLINE\n12:54 \nOkay, perfect. I just wanted to make sure that I had that correct. And then Antionetta, you mentioned that kind of like list of requirements that you have. I think that's wonderful where and I think that we will use it. Where I'd love to spend the time today is really getting an understanding of like what this dream LMS looks like and what kind of like the business drivers are for that. And then in terms of features and functionalities, I'll tell you Docebo is the best in class learning management system. And if you can send over that list of requirements, then I'll make sure that we're speaking to each of those when we do go through with a demo. So essentially, what I'll use today for is getting a really good understanding of what your business needs are. And then we'll pull together a fully custom demo for you and we'll spend an hour going through the whole software. So what I've kind of heard so far even just from the intros and like the little bit of information that arena sent over is that one of the main drivers is you need something that's gonna work for you right now. But also as you scale to over 200 locations in the next few years, and really keeping that all under one roof, is that like does that seem like the like main thing right now? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I'll tell you that's kind of where do leader in the industry is our ability to host multiple audiences. So what I hear from a lot of kind of franchise organizations is that they want to streamline training across locations and give franchise owners some permission and ability to have control over training in their organization so that it's not all living just at the top with Nicole or with you and tea or whoever it may be. Tell me a little bit about what the ideal vision is for hosting those multiple franchise locations? Like what are some of those key items that you're looking for?\nRJ\n15:02 \nWell, I think so if we're looking from a, you know, if there's a couple of different buckets like course creation, it's important for us to have simple course creation. I have worked in scorm. I did not personally work in scorm, but I know like we paid someone work in scorm and that was a mistake on our point, our part at the time because we weren't able to update, change, make new content quickly enough. And so, you know, we had to use someone else. So finding a platform that we would be able to execute from, you know, and Emily perspective my side and Tony to Nicole. And then all the way down to like one one example that might either at the local level or it's just in the top of my head is like we had back in COVID, was a big deal and we had, you know, we wanna make sure that all of our team knew the proper procedures for getting people into the studio. If we had an LMS, we could have created, you know, 12 slides, talked about the process and then made sure that everyone took that, you know, took that course to understand how to do that. So there's some speed. There's some things that they don't have to do. There's gonna be some courses that are extremely in depth. Yeah, definitely on what Antonietta and Nicole do. But then there's also things that we're gonna need some speed to be able to just say like we need to get this out and we need people to be trained.\nCAROLINE\n16:14 \nOkay. I love that. So talk to me a little bit more. So scorm, you know, maybe not the right fit for all of your content? Tell me about like what format you do want your training to be in? Are we, so you mentioned slides? What else? Like are we talking video quizzes?\nANTONIETTA\n16:33 \nYeah, that's a really important thing on the trainer side. On the fitness side, our trainers learn, you know, 55 minute classes via video. And we're currently hosting those videos on a separate site, you know, so they are linked out to like a web stir just so that we can upload really quickly and be agile with our video learnings. Ideally, everything would be housed within the LMS system. So all of our videos and we're constantly updating our library of classes to keep things fresh. And so, you know, storage is definitely something, you know, a lot of, a lot of video storage is important as well as ideally we would be able to communicate with our trainers the, you know, like video messaging back and forth on the site. So, you know, if somebody has some ideas that they're looking to have approved, right? They can have their computer, they can do, you know, here are my 10 moves in this sequence. And then we can say yes or no. So just video chat back and forth would also be really useful on the trainer.\nCAROLINE\n17:43 \nOkay, love that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Antonietta is the Chief Training Officer responsible for digital and in-studio training initiatives.\n• Emily oversees sales and operations at corporate locations, with a growing list of franchises in development.\n• RJ has decades of experience in franchising, having successfully onboarded two brands to new LMS systems.\n• Requirements include course creation capabilities, hosting multiple audiences across locations, video storage and communication features.

{"prompt":"EMILY\n17:45 \nI do love the interaction piece of, you know, like the modules like to be able to, you know, keep their attention. I mean, obviously, we're it's more, it's we're more dealing with studio coordinators, right? Sales and operations, and it can be pretty dry. So keeping them engaged in the modules to be able to have to click, for instance, to move on somewhere in a desk, right? If you've got a, you know, a graphic of a desk and, you know, show me where the first time client goes or whatever they have to click on something to be able to kinda move on in the lesson and certainly quizzes at the end, keeping it short and concise. And then for me to like being able to, you know, have different levels…\nNICOLE\n18:29 \nOf modules?\nEMILY\n18:30 \nBased and maybe not levels, but different modules based on like your path, right? Obviously, if you're a studio manager, you're going to have more pathways and more in depth training per SE, right? But I think the interactive piece is also important for sales and operations.\nCAROLINE\n18:44 \nOkay. I love that. And for folks who are in like sales and operations, is that usually a full time role that they're with people?\nEMILY\n18:52 \nI mean, managers, certainly studio coordinators. It's a mix of both.\nCAROLINE\n18:57 \nOkay. Okay. Cool. Okay. So I love the ideas around like speed engagement and collaboration and we definitely have some tools for that and then definitely quizzes, testing and then we call content agnostic. So whatever type of content you want to bring in, we can host it. And the nice thing is we have unlimited storage. So I know you were talking about like we need a lot of video storage. We'll be able to host it all. So that's good.\nRJ\n19:31 \nThe other things that we were looking for is potentially, you know, hosting the operating manual so that if they were taking a specific course, they would be able to, if they got questions wrong, it could link back to the operating manual so they can understand and read that section.\nCoach & Share\nRJ\n19:43 \nForums would be of interest, franchisee forums where they'd be able to, you know, share best practices, you know, from my thought process, as long as we can see things. I don't mind when people complain about the franchise door, but just complain in front of us. So the forums were a really great place for us to do in the past, right? And then self regulation because they're helping each other, right? So it's not as much on the franchise or.\nCoach & Share ends\nCAROLINE\n20:09 \nTotally in having those questions that they're asking, be visible to other people who have the same question. And also like especially for the place that you're in right now, getting an understanding of where there may be gaps in your training materials, so that you can continue to put new material out there. That's definitely something we hear a lot of.\nRJ\n20:32 \nI don't wish list, just go going and whip on into.\nANTONIETTA\n20:36 \nI was just gonna say, you know, with that idea just reporting, right? When they're taking the modules, how far are they getting through them? What's the completion rate? You know, tracking basically analysis is really important and, you know, maybe they don't move on right there. Things are paced so that they have to complete one thing before the other and that we have, you know, tools to see, yeah, how much they're actually completing how we talked about like how short or long is it taking, right? Are they just like skimming through the materials? Or are they actually, you know, watching or reading through everything more thoroughly? So.\nCustom Reports\nCAROLINE\n21:16 \nCost for reporting. I always like to ask like obviously, there's always the learning data. Like you mentioned, how long is someone taking in a certain course or is there a certain question that they're always getting wrong? But when I think about higher level reporting, what are some of like the key success metrics that you would be looking for?\nCustom Reports ends\nCAROLINE\n21:37 \nAnd ask that question? Because in the back of my mind, I'm thinking of the other fitness brands I've worked with. They've wondered about like how does training correlate with customer reviews, for example, at each of the different locations? How does training impact retention rates of your trainers? What are some of those like bigger metrics that you're looking at in terms of what a successful LMS would look like for you?\nANTONIETTA\n22:09 \nI think that's a great question. You know, I think there's reporting in terms of like what's actually happening in studio, what is the studio utilization? What is the conversion? And, you know, based on those numbers, most of the learnings are then like supportive and supplement, you know, supplementing in real time. So, I don't yeah, that's really curious like what are we? How are we linking the LMS strategy and system to, you know, what we're actually seeing in studio? Are there some paste modules that are released? You know, if and when the studio needs that extra support?\nCAROLINE\n22:49 \nIt's an interesting one for sales as well. I know Emily, maybe that's a little bit more in your world, but thinking about like are the most enabled sales people able to convert the highest or, you know, whatever it might be. I think a lot of this will become clear as you actually get to look inside the software and we can have those conversations and share customer examples as we go as well. But I'm always curious about those things because it's really what drives these projects. So that's great, curious when you're hoping to have your first learners in the system. Is there like a day that you're working towards?\nRJ\n23:33 \nMe, it's 2024 is when we're gonna really accelerate. So 2023 is a lot of planning. Hiring. Nicole is a big piece of what we're trying to do. She's been on boarded four weeks ago and, you know, we have one franchise open the next batch of franchises, four or five franchise open over the summer. And then, you know, we'll have another in the fourth quarter. So I don't if we got this project complete, you know, in the calendar year 2023, I think that would be successful for us. That means identifying, you know, an LMS creating the content, moving school age over all those things. It's a lot but that would be something that I feel would be within this calendar year. I think it would be really of interest for us to do and help us for what 2024 is.\nANTONIETTA\n24:25 \nI would say by, from my perspective, it's a little bit earlier because so much of what we have is actually built out. So it is just a matter of transferring and I would love to be able to test our learnings before we head into 2024 because we do have like so much of our system built. So it really is just a matter of kind of like transferring, figuring out what the pacing of the modules are. You know, figuring out like cadence is more on the trainer side. Yes, we're building but we have so many materials. So I would love to be able to test and then move, you know, stuff around accordingly with the franchisees that were onboarding by Q4. So like for me, it's really by Q4 by even like September end of summer for us to be able to be in the system, learning the system before we head into, you know, what's going to be a really busy time? I think is definitely optimal. And, you know, I guess it brings the question too of what we're saying like done, you know, we're going to be obviously phasing the onboarding. So I think that that's something like can we phase? So that may be the fitness side is in the system a little bit sooner than, you know, the operational side of that's just sort of how we're tracking and pasting because so much of our learning is, you know, entirely reliant on the LMS and even our ongoing development too. We have so many ongoing development modules even within our corporate. So yeah, that would be my personal.\nEMILY\n25:58 \nYeah. And I think so like Antonietta to your point fitness is, you know, has yours already set up in quality? So, I think, you know, if you guys can move forward faster, I think for us, it's gonna first sales ops sizes gonna just take a little bit longer, you know, because we don't have the, I mean we don't really have the content, you know, drafted already.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily discussed needing interactive modules with engagement activities, quizzes and graphics to keep users focused on the material.\n• RJ mentioned needing a capability for linking to the operating manual after questions have been answered incorrectly, as well as searching for forums where visitors can discuss best practices and help others. \n• Antonietta highlighted tracking data such as completion time and rates, as well as content that could be released if needed. \n• Caroline asked about key success metrics for reporting purposes and if there was an expected time frame for implementation of the program.\n• RJ suggested accelerating by 2024 but Antonietta suggested testing everything before then in order to phase onboarding. \n• Emily concluded that sales ops will take longer as they need to create content from scratch. END"}
{"prompt":"RJ\n26:16 \nInteresting point is I don't know if there is any type of transition from school age to, you know, what can we, is there anything how it's built? Can we transition it to this platform without doing everything manually? I don't know if that's a reasonable ask second piece that we haven't spoken about. Maybe the fifth piece we haven't spoken about is having some support and developing some of these courses. So if we do have content that we want, is there someone on the team that we would be able to use as a resource? You know, we're four people, but there's a lot of content to write.\nIntegrations\nRJ\n26:51 \nSo if we need, you know, if we needed extra support to be able to write these things that would be of interest as well.\nCAROLINE\n26:56 \nOkay. Yeah. Good question. So I'll tell you from the onboarding in migration perspective, migration, meaning bringing everything from one system into Docebo. We do have services and I'll tell you it's usually very economical especially if you don't have like 18 years of data that you're bringing over kind of thing. So that can help you be a little bit hands off in that process and make it a bit of a lighter lift for you in terms of content building. I'm curious what type of content you're looking for? Because we do have off the shelf content, we have a content library that may help to complement some of your more proprietary content that's specific to people probably more around like communication or like solutions oriented selling in that type of thing. Is that what you're looking for or someone to help you actually build proprietary content?\nIntegrations ends\nRJ\n27:52 \nSo the app manual and the LMS will be very one and much in one and the same, just a different delivery method and education. So if we had, you know, opening procedures for the studio, the student coordinators need to take. So like what do they need to do or, you know, the sales process for a first time customer, first time client? What does that look like? What are you supposed to be doing? And so there is a custom nature, but like those things exist like we would be able to say there's section two point two point two, right? We need to put this into some type of learning, you know, that's you know, however maybe 15 slides if it's in that kind of delivery method. Like, so we're not creating on it. We had, you know, in there's a pretty large operating manual that could be translated into it. So like with Emily and I, we're not starting from square one from the content. We don't have what they would, Antonietta and Nicole have it like they've already have a school that works. We got all the content. It just hasn't been put into a platform at all.\nOnboarding\nCAROLINE\n28:52 \nOkay. Love that. So I will say let's do a little bit more digging on that and what exactly you need. Let's make sure that Docebo is the right software for you first. But as like kind of a high level kind of response to that through onboarding through that process, you will be working with our Professional services team on best practices on how to kinda deliver that existing content. And then if you're interested in having someone actually assist you in building additional content, we have Professional services for that as well. So on my end, we cover all your bases and no, no hesitations there. So keeping an eye on the time I'll tell you from a high level?\nWrap-Up\nRJ\n29:38 \nDo, have, I do have to hop. So I'll just circle back with Emily and I appreciate the time and we'll look forward to the next steps.\nCAROLINE\n29:47 \nYeah, me too. Thanks, AJ. Thank you. Does anyone else have to have a hard stop?\nANTONIETTA\n29:53 \nYeah, I kinda do exit to run into a training.\nEMILY\n29:56 \nAs well.\nCAROLINE\n29:58 \nOkay. Well, nice to meet you both. Nicole. If you can stick around then maybe?\nANTONIETTA\n30:03 \nPerfect. Okay. Thanks.\nEMILY\n30:05 \nThank you.\nCAROLINE\n30:08 \nPerfect. Well, thanks for rallying the whole crew. I know it's hard to get like calendars aligned for that.\nNICOLE\n30:15 \nYeah, no problem. I definitely want everyone to come in and just, you know, obviously talk about their specific over site and areas of the business just because we are all kind of starting from different… places.\nIntegrations\nNICOLE\n30:31 \nYou know, I will say Antonietta and myself like, you know, we definitely have more of, we have all of this content. A lot of the content built out. I think like for me, I'm going to be the one between Antonietta and myself constant. I'm going to be the one building up this content obviously, but then updating it constantly.\nIntegrations ends\nNICOLE\n30:52 \nSo I want to be very, I want to personally be very versed with the software, how to build courses, all of the Permissions, those type of things because I feel like it's so important, you know, even though I know our wants to be more hands off when it comes to that kind of stuff for me personally, I want to be hands on so that I can be very nimble in making these adjustments as we continue to add or, you know, edit content.\nWrap-Up\nCAROLINE\n31:19 \nYeah, that's awesome. And I'll tell you Nicole, like I want like, I know you're new to your role. So like lean on me. I wanna make you look good. So like as much as you and I wanna text or email whatever I'm happy to like curate this demo so that we like totally blow away all your other team members and like make it perfect for you and make you look good.\nNext Steps\nCAROLINE\n31:45 \nMake like get you the software that you wanna be using day in and day out. So like I say, I love this stuff especially when brands have nice branding and whatnot, we'll make it look really good. My next step is usually to go ahead and schedule a demo. Is that what you were hoping to do?\nNext Steps ends\nNICOLE\n32:04 \nYeah. So I think that would be great for all of us to either jump on the demo. Like as we did today, the full team. And if, for whatever reason, not all of us can be on recording it just so that we can, you know, share it with those that might not be able to be present. And then I can also share with you kind of our list that we've created together. You know, of all of the things that would be our, you know, our wish list basically and, you know, of course, there there might be one or two things that we might have to forego or what have you, but I think, you know, what we've hit on today. Those are the kind of the burning things that we really need. And then you can just see the full list of everything that we would like. And I will say like, you know, coming into this meeting, I definitely looked at the company and what it is that you offer the features and so forth. And, you know, almost everything that's on our list is part of what you deliver. So, you know, I would be surprised if there wasn't something if there was something that you couldn't assist us with. But I think like you said earlier, it's just really diving into like what are the exact needs of each department?\nOnboarding\nNICOLE\n33:15 \nAnd I think there are a few more nuances to the operations and sales team than there are to ours. So, you know, I think doing the demo will really help to kind of uncover those. Yeah.\nCAROLINE\n33:28 \nAnd it's great. You have like a not a rush timeline so that you can really make sure that you're making the right decision.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Antonietta and Emily said they have existing content but need help with delivery. \n• Nicole will be building and updating content and wants to be very versed in the software. \n END"}

I sent over the invite, but like I say, Nicole, like please do send me that wish list of yours and then anything else like if you're thinking bells and whistles you think of like certain things that your team is really gonna care about, send them my way.\nWrap-Up ends\nCAROLINE\n36:57 \nLike it's never a disturbance. The more transparent you can be with me, the easier it is for both of us. So, yeah, I'm looking.\nNICOLE\n37:07 \nI would say the one thing to that Emily kinda touched upon which I think could be really cool. And I, I'm sure that this is something that you guys offer as well as like the image exploration where you can have like for…\nCAROLINE\n37:20 \nFor…\nNICOLE\n37:20 \nExample, for us, we have a ton of pieces of equipment that are unique to us and to our method. And so to be able to have a picture of like our transformation kit of equipment and be able to click on that picture. And then it pops up a video of how to set up that piece of equipment or what have you just like making the experience so super streamlined to Emily's point interactive in that we're not taking them to a bunch of different places, but I think like I kind of like think of also to like that surprise and delight moment in your training where it's like, wow, that was really cool. Like I just have to click on this and I get to know the full history of this equipment, how to set it up, how it's used, do's and don'ts those type of things I think that could be really powerful especially for, you know, from my side of things as well.\nLayout & Content\nNICOLE\n38:15 \nBut I think the others, they haven't seen something like that before. So I think that could be really cool for them. As for them as well. And, you know, different cases for.\nCAROLINE\n38:25 \nThat's great. You know, anything like that? That's wonderful because I like the thing is it's so configurable the platform. So the more I know about the way you want information presented, I can literally go in and just create that experience for you. Okay. Yeah. So that's super helpful.

Like, why are we acting like it's already warm when it's not gonna warm out to like three, so.\nNICK\n4:31 \nYeah, yeah. I know what you mean. It's interesting in Toronto because it'll be like 14 degrees on a day like this, which is like beautiful spring weather. It's where I thrive to be honest. But then the wind chill makes it just super cold. Like I was standing up there on my balcony. And then a burst of wind just hits me and I'm like I wanna go back inside. This isn't fun for me anymore. But yeah, only a couple more, a full steam ahead on nicer weather.\nKATLYN\n4:59 \nYeah, we're getting the.\nNICK\n5:01 \nGood stuff. Well, yeah, just so today, some interesting news, Matt and I got some more approvals from our side of our side of things at Docebo upfront to be transparent.\nSmall Talk ends\nNICK\n5:14 \nThis is our best and final offer like this is kinda the best that we can do pricing wise. Not too much has changed in terms of like the actual dollar values themselves. But there have been some changes in… more so to speak like the structure of the pricing and how that's gonna work for you. So I'm just gonna go ahead and share my screen. I'll walk us through this. I know we got booked until three 30, but I don't think it's gonna take the full half hour for us to go through this and I just kinda move these Zoom bars here on my screen so I can see this. Okay. But Katlyn, what we're looking at here is just the two solutions that we spoke about. So this, it's very similar to the acceleration package is the exact same price, however you'll probably notice that it doesn't include Docebo Shape, which is something that comes with the acceleration package. However, it's a tool that we, I don't even think we talked about it to be honest, and I don't really see it being a massive differentiator in your use case from Docebo. So it's not a big deal that we have to leave it out here. But really the reason why we did have to is because it was the only way for us to get the second part of pricing approved, which is what I'm gonna show you shortly.\nPricing\nNICK\n6:22 \nBut again, what we're looking at here is just yearly signing on with up to 500 monthly active users at around 27,000 with an onboarding plan of eight weeks at 5,000.\nKATLYN\n6:35 \nYou remind me what do Shape was again?\nNICK\n6:38 \nIt's just, it's like an AI powered content creation tool, so you could take something like a PDF and put it into Shape and it would spit out like a two or three minute video.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n6:47 \nSome people use it. I mean, it's interesting, but it's you know, again, not something that we spoke too highly about. I don't think it will be super relevant to your project.\nKATLYN\n6:57 \nDoes it still include your four sovereign tool?\nNICK\n7:01 \nYeah, like you can build courses and stuff like that through it. Just, it doesn't have the Shape tool itself… into the contracting terms here.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n7:13 \nOkay. And how much is Shape if we want to add that on later?\nNICK\n7:16 \nIt's about 7,500 per year.\nKATLYN\n7:20 \nOkay. Gotcha. Thank you.\nNICK\n7:25 \nYeah, no worries at all. But in terms of, you know, like this contract here and what we're about to show you, so again, this has been approved until the end of the month.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n7:37 \nAnd I know when we had spoken a couple of weeks ago talking about timelines, a couple more things. We have to do just a demo with your CEO and then obviously figuring out the connect stuff with Spence if you wanted to move forward. But again, this has been approved until February 20 eighth.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n7:51 \nAnd I just want to double check in terms of timeline that's something that's still realistic from your side of things, correct?\nKATLYN\n7:57 \nI mean, I'm really looking to be done shopping at this point, so.\nNICK\n8:01 \nOkay, perfect. And aside from that demo with your CEO and figuring out connect with Spence, is there, you know, going to be any legal review? Is there any financial review from your finance team? Anything along those lines or is it more just, hey, let's demo with your CEO, figure out connect short contract review and then signing an agreement?\nKATLYN\n8:22 \nAs far as legal review, I think the main thing that I'd be looking at in the contract is just verbiage that preserves our ownership over our content, which I'm assuming is not an issue in the contract. But when we're reading it, that's what we're gonna be looking for.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They finalized pricing details for an onboarding plan with up to 500 monthly active users at 27,000.\n• They confirmed that Shape would not be included but would cost 7,500 if desired later.\n• For the legal review, the main thing they are looking for is language that preserves their ownership over their content. END"}
{"prompt":"KATLYN\n8:22 \nAs far as legal review, I think the main thing that I'd be looking at in the contract is just verbiage that preserves our ownership over our content, which I'm assuming is not an issue in the contract. But when we're reading it, that's what we're gonna be looking for.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n8:37 \nYeah. I mean, you own everything with Docebo especially your own content. So there are certain vendors out there who you'll partner with them. If you build courses within them, they won't let you take it elsewhere. If you ever decide to leave them. We're not like that. We do something called exit packages. So in the case they were to leave Docebo, which obviously is an ideal from both of our side of things. You would be able to have all those courses taken with you to another vendor, if you did want to go that direction.\nKATLYN\n9:03 \nOkay. So if that did happen, would we, so it sounds like we own the content.\nIntegrations ends\nKATLYN\n9:09 \nWould we have to pay for an exit package to be able to like have like get access to it or downloaded or something like, I'm not sure what you mean by the exit package?\nNICK\n9:18 \nYeah… I'll have to double check on that for you, but basically like if you were to say, so say, for example, you sign on with the, obviously when you're setting up the platform, you're going to be building out your courses within Docebo structuring them, putting in the content and like formatting them. There are ways for you to export that from the platform. In the case that you were to go to another vendor down the line.\nKATLYN\n9:45 \nYeah, that makes sense. Okay. Hopefully I won't you know, I'd like to sit company for a while.\nNICK\n9:50 \nExactly. Yeah, we're in the exact same boat and that's kind of the worst case scenario, but it is always nice to know that the option is there because unfortunately, it's not something that a lot of vendors will do as a way to retain their current book of business.\nPricing\nNICK\n10:02 \nSo just thought I toss that out there, but it sounds like we're good to go from there. So what we're about to show you just wanna mention it's kind of along the lines of like accessing discounts forever. So previously, when we had spoken and kinda gone through the step up quote, what that contracting entails is it sounded like you weren't necessarily sure that you wanted to in today for 3,000 users down the line in the case you don't hit them, it more was like, hey, if we could offer you discounts for, you know, price abilities. So saying if you signed on with 500 monthly active users today, we would want to honor that pricing down the line in the case that you did reach that number. So pretty much what we have done and this was from, I guess Matt and I work together with our VP of sales and also our finance team to get this approved.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n10:54 \nTo be totally honest, we had no idea that we were able to do this and technically, we're not necessarily supposed to, but we have gotten it approved for your case since it is a lot different.\nMATT\n11:06 \nWe kinda just kept asking the same question over we got the answer. So I was really happy with the answer. I'm hoping you're really happy as well, but I know like committing when we talked before, it sounded very much like committing to that ramp deal. Just put too much risk. You didn't feel comfortable with it. So I thought what can we do to make it feasible and provide you something like certainty as to what's going on and try to be as competitive as possible?\nPricing\nMATT\n11:40 \nWe realized we're a higher price solution. We also think we're a much better solution but can we get it so that there's not such a huge difference between the prices and provide you with some certainty going for the next three years?\nKATLYN\n11:56 \nAwesome. Well, I appreciate the work you guys put into that. Thank you.\nNICK\n12:00 \nYou're welcome, but without further ado. So basically what we have here is this is just the set of what I guess we'll call it scale of pricing. But Katlyn, the way that the terms are going to work for this offer specifically is if you were to sign on with Docebo, we're going to start you at a three year tier for 500 monthly active users at that 27 K price point. However in the case that, you know, you reached a 1,000 level six months in, you reached the 2000 level at the end of the year. And then you reached the 3,000 level, maybe a year and a half to two years. For now, when we had last spoken, if you were to come on board with the 500 monthly active user users and say, okay, I'm a year into my contract, I wanna move up to the 3,000 tier discounting. Is at the discretion of your account manager, which isn't price stability and not something that you wanted. You didn't want to take that risk. So here, what we've done is we've locked in these discounts for you today in the case that you need them in the future, so we could start today and say 500 monthly active users and then a year and a half from now, you're at the 3,000 mark, you can choose any of these tiers to move up to, and you'll be paying the discounted pricing that we've had approved to you today, but you won't be paying it until the future when you're actually ready to be paying at that price point.\nPricing ends\nKATLYN\n13:16 \nAwesome. So let me just make sure I'm backing with you here just because when I read a chart, it takes me a little bit of time to like read what you guys have seen already. So, okay. So we have like the gradient tiers super helpful. By the way.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n13:29 \nThank you. Is there a separate charge between the LMS column and discover coaching share? Are those like two, those are those two prices don't add together correct?\nNICK\n13:42 \nYeah, these are just for reference. So say for example, you were to go like 500 monthly active users today, just that without this type of pricing and a year from now bump up to a 1,000. What the account manager would quote you is the 35 and the 14. So basically 50 K, however we're saying in the case that now we have this pricing approved a year from now, you're ready to move into a 1,000. We're telling you now, and it's going to be signed an agreement that you will receive a 30 percent discount at that price level when you are ready to get to that level, which would be 34,000 for the 1,000 monthly active user mark.\nWrap-Up\nKATLYN\n14:17 \nOkay, cool. So I can just refer to the right hand column. And so awesome. So thanks. I appreciate you guys moving on this. I think this is something that's a little bit easier to like work through than the, maybe the number we looked at on the last call.\nCoach & Share\nKATLYN\n14:32 \nSo thank you, right? Appreciate that. So it looks like, okay. So it looks like it's a 1,000 user tier with discover coach and share that we've come closer to the numbers we talked about earlier on in the process. And you guys have gone so far as to, with that initial quote, it didn't include discover coaching share.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n14:54 \nThis number would be around 35,000 for a 1,000. So I appreciate that 1,500 we have… it's about 40 K. Let's see.\nKATLYN\n15:18 \nOkay. I think I'm tracking with you and I do appreciate you guys coming down on the price. It's it does help a lot compared to the last numbers we talked about. It gets the 1,000 closer to those like initial numbers we were looking at. So thank you. I think essentially where it puts me into some follow up questions, the price is still double what Absorb is charging. So, like it would still be 100 percent increase over the other platform that I'm looking at. So I still have to factor that in. And so it leads me to just one of the things that they are doing is the three year contract is going to have the one year opt out for us. Is that something that you guys are able to get approved on your end?\nMATT\n16:02 \nSo one year opt out is not something that we're going to approve but how it's set up in the contract and we can walk you through this when we send over the msa. Is that if we don't honor certain service levels with, within the time that you're with us, you have a way to get out of the contract.\nPricing ends\nKATLYN\n16:26 \nYeah. I mean, like if you guys, you know, didn't meet your sla, but if the tool itself ends up just not meeting our needs or we have issues that aren't easily tackled by an sla clause, it's still in for three years. So… can you give me an example of one of the service levels that like you're talking about?\nMATT\n16:51 \nOff off hand?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Katlyn and Nick discussed legal review of the contract, ensuring that Docebo preserves their ownership of content.\n• A special offer was provided to Katlyn with discounts locked in for the future, based on her current 500 monthly active user level at the 27K price point. \n• A one year opt-out clause was not approved, but service level agreements were discussed as a way for Katlyn to exit the contract if needed. END"}
{"prompt":"KATLYN\n16:53 \nLike are you talking about like the response time for tickets or… onboarding not coming through or something like of that nature.\nMATT\n17:04 \nThis is more if the software is down and not working.\nKATLYN\n17:07 \nOkay.\nMATT\n17:08 \nYes. Okay. It's not. I think where at the end of one year, you're like, I don't like it anymore and I want to get out… that's not… that's where it's being held as for three years, this is the commitment we've made.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n17:26 \nOkay. And then one of the things with our workflow that we talked about for subscriptions was that for eCommerce, if we work with stripe sea, we'd be able to handle the subscription workflow within Docebo without having to use an API integration. What kind of cost is going to be involved if we don't find that stripe sa, meets our needs, and we wanna go with Shopify, or we wanna use pay pal at the end of having to integrate. I think the prices we were looking at earlier on in the process for that, we're gonna be like 13 K. And I wanna make sure that we've talked about that piece as well… because I wanna sign on with the assumption that like we'd be able to subscribe clients within the platform with stripe sea… that could work, but it also has some variables.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n18:20 \nYeah. So I think in terms of connect, like what we can do is that maybe this is something you and I could talk about offline. They can connect into here in the case that you would need it in the future. However the way connect pricing works. So it's 7,500 for the initial connector or the only connector that you'll need to connect us with, you know, Shopify, for example, it's just a connect onboarding which is 5,500 additional to that.\nPricing\nNICK\n18:46 \nSo it's only 13 K in year one. And then it's 75 in years two and three for the connector itself. And also to one more thing Katlyn in terms of like the one year opt out clause, Matt set it right? I mean, it's not necessarily something that we're going to put into a contract or put into writing.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n19:03 \nHowever one of the ways, you know, we could perhaps make you more comfortable with the three years even if we did more validation within the platform. Like from your side of things, is there, I guess any nerves? Like are you curious if like doc is not going to meet expectations? Like what can we do from our side to make you more comfortable with making a decision without putting a one year opt in, into, right?\nKATLYN\n19:25 \nYeah, I think so. I think having some time in the trial portal would be helpful especially just like even just now to the end of February making sure that we have some trial time to make sure that, you know, just answer the usability questions.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n19:44 \nBut honestly, what it comes down to is that I think that over the next couple of years that MS are going to become more friendly towards clients that are not using the product for internal corporate onboarding and are seeking to bring on external train external clients and use moditizer content, offer recurring subscriptions.\nPayment Gateway ends\nKATLYN\n20:11 \nAnd I think we're gonna see like this is just my guess but I think we're gonna see like the features and the usability of that get friendlier in the near term. And yeah, I mean Docebo is a leader in the space you guys have like quality tool. I do not wanna like diminish what you guys have created because it's truly impressive. However right now, most of your clients if I'm understanding correctly from my research are corporations that seek to train their internal employees on, you know, product knowledge, soft skills, compliance. They're not monetizing that content and it's kind of blended to the situation we're looking at, which is okay, we can do subscriptions within Docebo but only with this one third party vendor, right? So I foresee the space improving those workflows over the next couple of years. And I just don't love the idea of being walked into a three year.\nNICK\n21:08 \nTract…\nKATLYN\n21:09 \nWhen our use case is kind of like stretching what Docebo can do for Automatic recurring subscriptions for external clients. So my hope would be that you guys continue to be a front runner in that space.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n21:26 \nBut three years is, you know, within the next three years, we'll see who kinda like pops in and makes it really easy for people to monetize their content.\nMATT\n21:39 \nRight. I think it's these are probably better questions for Spence to come in and provide the technical expertise on where that is and what we're looking at from a stripe and Shopify standpoint. If you work with stripe, you can work with Shopify and vice versa. Shopify payment gateways is based on stripe. Shopify owns part of stripe. It's where I came from. I spent four years at Shopify before I came here and, but we need for that just goes outside like my level of understanding of how this all works.\nPayment Gateway ends\nMATT\n22:14 \nWe need Spence to come in and explain that exactly… this was today is just more of like… can we stay in the running based on the pricing that we've provided you?\nKATLYN\n22:26 \nRight. Yeah. And I appreciate that only more expenses time if we don't need to. I think that would just kinda maybe speak to maybe one of the things that would hold me back when I'm thinking like, okay, we're going to be using this tool for three years in three years.\nPayment Gateway\nKATLYN\n22:42 \nYou know, I certainly envision us a, having more than 3,000 users and so, but I appreciate you guys, you know, showing me that structure. It's not a problem… but our use case being more complex and wanting to use tools that make it really easy for… monetization and subscriptions.\nPayment Gateway ends\nKATLYN\n23:04 \nSo your platform can do it. And it's more just if… not just. But normally, when we choose a vendor, we don't sign a three year contract because needs can change over time and it's important to stay with who is the front one space and make sure that still meeting the needs.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n23:27 \nSo to Absorb there half the price I have a one year opt out on the three year contract. Gives me like that little room. And if I do have to integrate with a third party vendor outside of the platform, it's only like 1,100 dollars instead of like 13 K, which feels like a big difference. Could you clarify something for me, Nick, you said with Docebo connect, it's like 5,500 dollars setup year one and then 7,500 each year. Is there what's the reason that it recurs the charge every year? Is it assuming that there's other integrations that are occurring?\nIntegrations\nKATLYN\n24:08 \nOr do you have or it feels like for us to set up a third party vendor for eCommerce that would be like a one time setup. So I just wanted to clarify why Docebo connect would charge the 7,500 on an annual basis?\nNICK\n24:25 \nYeah. I mean, for the most part, it's managed through Docebo. It's similar to our software, right? Like we have maintenance cost on the software, which is why we charge what we charge. Also because of the way that we position in the market with, you know, very strong product. It's gonna cost a little bit more. Connects basically is a white labeled Workato. However, it's all just managed through Docebo aside from setting up the recipe, which is basically like the coding between connect and Shopify, which again is why we would charge for onboarding because we're hands on when it comes to setting that up. But again, it's part of a managed service. I mean, you could set up the integration yourself through something like a Workato, maybe even using stuff like API calls if you wanted to get creative with it. However why we have the direct recipe with Shopify because either people don't have the resources to put together that connector themselves, or they'd rather have something you know, trusted through the LMS platform that's gonna facilitate that super easily for them. So, I mean it's completely up to you, right? Like you could connect with Shopify without needing a connector. I'm 90 percent sure. I'll get expense to validate that. However if you did just want it to be easy to manage, that's why we have connect.\nKATLYN\n25:40 \nOkay. I think that's one of the areas that's just a little fuzzy for me is whether or not we need to have the connect and if we do then that's an additional like quite a bit of cost like it's an additional 13 K in year one and then, you know, more or two or three.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Katlyn inquired about the cost of an API integration if they do not choose to use Stripe SEA.\n• Nick clarified that the one-time setup base cost is 13K, with an additional 7.5K in years two and three for the Connector itself. \n• Nick also offered a talk to provide technical expertise for the Stripe and Shopify standpoint. \n• Katlyn expressed her understanding that Docebo is mostly used for corporate employees' training, but was uncertain about their ability to monetize and do subscriptions. \n• Matt mentioned that Spence could come in to further clarify the details and discussed a potential trial period for validating usability questions.  END"}
{"prompt":"KATLYN\n25:58 \nSo if we could just put our finger on if we really need that or not, I think that would help. So really those are my, those are the main three things that I have to contemplate is if we move forward with them, even though I love your social learning platform, it's still twice the cost of Absorb.\nPricing\nKATLYN\n26:18 \nWe would also have less more risk, you know, less, you know, bubble wrap because it'll be a three year contract and there's no one year opt out I and a little ambiguity on if we need to connect and knowing that would cost an additional 13 K. So if we were able to solve two of those three problems, if we were able to solve the one year opt out with a three year or, and if we were able to like feel pretty comfortable that we either wouldn't need Docebo connect or would be able if it was like a nominal price like what Absorb is charging.\nPricing ends\nKATLYN\n26:58 \nAnd then it's just not then it's just a non issue. I think that would make it a little bit easier to move forward. Knowing that when we do, we're committing to twice the cost of the other competitor.\nNICK\n27:12 \nOkay. Okay. That works. So, so why don't, we do this in terms of next steps? Let's potentially set up a call with Spence to go through connect, you know, really kind of button down and see if that is something that you'd need. In the case that it is, we can talk about cost and that's something that Matt and I can potentially chat about offline when the timing's right?\nKATLYN\n27:36 \nAnd…\nNICK\n27:37 \nThen also too with that call in Spence, I think again going back to what I was saying earlier with the one year opt out, it's not something we do unfortunately. However there are maybe some things that we can do from the solution side of things, right? Working with Spence, getting you comfortable with the platform, maybe talking about our road map and how we plan on improving the external training side of things. Just so in three years, you know, I mean, I'm fairly confident to say we're still going to be a market leader in that space. And if that is a way that the market starts trending, I'm sure Docebo would like to go towards that direction as well. It's just a matter of getting maybe you some documentation that, you know, would make you more comfortable, make the CEO more comfortable. So that three years from now… it's fair to say that we'd still be a leader in that space. Does that sound like a fair plan for next steps?\nKATLYN\n28:27 \nYeah. And I think I would just add that Matt, I know it's important to you that we're not like spinning wheels here and that we're not using Spence time if we don't really need to.\nWrap-Up\nKATLYN\n28:36 \nSo if you want to start by just like chatting with Spence and seeing like if you can, he knows more about integrations and API than I do. And if we can just boil it down to like whether I need to connect or not, that would help. And if he has follow up questions, I'm always happy to hop on a call but I also want to be your special.\nWrap-Up ends\nMATT\n28:58 \nYeah. Yeah, that's a better plan. Let's figure this out… because if you need it, it's gonna cost that much. There's that much of a discrepancy from Absorb. I think I know what the answer is going to be.\nKATLYN\n29:17 \nYeah. So like let's put our finger on if we really need it or not or if stripe sea is likely sufficient. And then I can do research on my end to see if I have any qualms about using stripe sea.\nWrap-Up\nMATT\n29:28 \nMakes sense.\nNICK\n29:29 \nYeah, that sounds good to me. So I'll touch base with Spence and I can't even speak today. In the meantime, Katlyn I'll email you over these numbers for, you know, for review, take into your CEO, let us know what they say and look to go from there.\nKATLYN\n29:46 \nOkay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Let me know if you have any questions.\nMATT\n29:49 \nOf course. Well, you.\nNICK\n29:50 \nTake care.\nKATLYN\n29:51 \nBye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Katlyn mentioned that Docebo is twice the cost of Absorb.\n• She contemplated if the one year opt out can be changed to a three year contract, as well as getting more clarity on the cost of Docebo Connect.\n• Matt and Nick offered to have a call with Spence to confirm whether Connect is needed or not, explore options for cost and also discuss road map for external training side of things. \n• Matt proposed to send over numbers for review and follow up afterwards.

Hopefully, yeah, how's the move? I hope that's going well.\nCAITLIN\n1:04 \nIt's going, it's definitely taking longer than anticipated. Lots of driving and like waiting around. I finally got internet yesterday, so that was the biggest thing so that I can finally like work because it was kind of like, I apologize if I've been out the last or not replying as much because I've just been sitting waiting at my place without internet for the last like couple of days, which has made work hard, but now I have internet. So that's good.\nRICKY\n1:38 \nImagine how far did you move?\nCAITLIN\n1:40 \nNot very far. Luckily only like one town over. Just, I finally decided to buy a place versus renting.\nTIM\n1:50 \nBut moving is horrible just in general.\nCAITLIN\n1:54 \nYeah, yeah. And like it's like my parents are moving at the same time or they're moving kind of next month. So they're gonna let me like piggy back on like their U haul that they're renting for the week. But like that means like all my big furniture pieces or some of them aren't there. So it's kinda just like I'm like, all right, I'm going to, I just need to see if I can move by hand, all of my non big pieces. So I don't have to buy a separate.\nPricing\nTIM\n2:26 \nWow. It's…\nRICKY\n2:28 \nYeah… a move like at one point, it was like four times in five years, and I don't really want to have to do that again.\nCAITLIN\n2:40 \nNow, I haven't had to move in like three or four years, and you forget it when you're actually doing it.\nRICKY\n2:49 \nYeah.\nPricing ends\nRICKY\n2:50 \nI got lucky.

So like it's mostly just new stuff that's getting delivered.\nSmall Talk\nCAITLIN\n3:08 \nSo it's more of like I hate like boxing stuff and then like re box and then like boxing it when I'm only like it's only like 25 minute difference. So instead it's just like a lot of little trips where I'm like I'm not gonna like put this in a box and like tape it up so I can put it all so that I can move it, you know, to the next town over so I can unpack it. So I'm just trying to get all that.\nSmall Talk ends\nRICKY\n3:34 \nWell, definitely a lot on your play and I certainly understand that. But definitely appreciate your time today.

I know we had a few meetings up until this point going over some additional things that you guys needed, of course, provide you with some of the pricing last time.\nOnboarding\nRICKY\n3:53 \nSo really what I want to do is just kinda sync up with you and maybe get an understanding of, I know your timeline moved a little bit. But if we can maybe establish a time line and understand what we, what I have to do essentially to help you get to that timeline from here and what are the, some of the things that maybe we're missing? Whether it's from like an it or we can start like legal process, things like that. Just so your teams just really I just wanted to stop in a timeline with you and understand kind of where you are right now.\nCAITLIN\n4:19 \nNo, definitely. So I met with Rachel and we went over all of the pricing and kind of as well as Shape this week and she liked it.\nOnboarding ends\nCAITLIN\n4:31 \nShe wants our in house designer to kind of play around with it this week. So I set him up with kind of just the link that you guys have for that demo for Shape. She also wanted to see have two of the leaders that she's picking out from like our above property leaders, try it because we're more of getting like a usability standpoint of like, well, our leaders be able to use it. So we're currently doing that. And then I just had a couple of questions on the admin portal I was using. Thank you guys for providing that demo for us. I had just a little bit of a hard time uploading scorm and assigning them and I think I might have been doing it wrong. So… that was just kind of the only kind of question I had kind of on that front. And then from an it perspective, I need to go and I need to talk to Kelsey and Brad… because, and I know Kelsey asked this last time on, is it called single sign on? Yeah. And you guys are compatible with that, right?\nNotifications\nRICKY\n5:52 \nYep. Yeah.\nCAITLIN\n5:53 \nSo I just need to go and work with Brad. I got our email accounts. So I'm figuring out because like the number of people who have emails and the number of people who have emails according to it, and the number of people who have emails according to our HRIS system, it's about 500 people different.\nNotifications ends\nCAITLIN\n6:14 \nSo I need to go figure out that difference. Cause I just when we present this to Brad, he's going to obviously be there's a lot more people that have emails than I thought, which is great. They've obviously been expanding that, but he's always more nervous on expanding it to people who don't have a work email addresses, which was way more than I thought I we wouldn't obviously be able to do it for the first year. But afterwards it looks like we'd be able to expand to that. I just need to get run by the security with him as well as our biggest thing was if we wanted to potentially expand this to people without emails… how that would work and what he would allow there.\nOnboarding\nCAITLIN\n7:11 \nSo I need to meet with him to go over that. And then that would probably be just like I'll schedule a follow up with that. And then I just have to, yeah. So, and then we also we hired a new person to help us with the transition. So they're starting in March as well as Allison who hasn't been on the last couple of calls.\nOnboarding ends\nCAITLIN\n7:35 \nI don't know she's on a leave of absence for March. So we're probably going to be making our like, you know, looking at contracts and stuff like that. I would say the first week of March would be our time line just because that's when I'm gonna also have like a four man team. So I can actually start looking at transition because right now it's just Jori and I know a lot of times that once… you know, sign the contract, we start the ground running so, but yeah, and then I just need to run by kind of the content call. I know Lisa is on vacation until the 20 first. But the biggest thing with her is I need to get… the Osha stuff that's the stuff I really wanna go over from a content perspective because I don't know which like I know the different legal trainings, they have, different people who are required to see it. So I want to, I need to get with her to see if the people who currently have email addresses are the ones who need it because I'll probably then even include them in the initial stage so that we can transition to an onboarding or an Osha training.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ricky wanted to establish a timeline and understand what needs to be done to help Ricky's team reach it.\n• The in-house designer was set up with the Shape demo, and two above property leaders were chosen to test usability.\n• Caitlin had difficulty uploading SCORM and assigning it.  \n• They are compatible with Single Sign On. \n• There is a 500 person discrepancy between emails in their HRIS system and the number of people who have email addresses. \n• A new person was hired to help with the transition, starting in March. \n• Lisa will handle content review upon returning from vacation on the 21st for Osha training for those with email addresses. END"}
{"prompt":"CAITLIN\n17:04 \nSo it would be my goal eventually to get all of those people with email addresses onto the system because I know at minimum that's like what our, it would be okay with because they have email addresses. It's just that one getting that done in a one year.\nNotifications ends\nCAITLIN\n17:28 \nIt would be hard and two, we'd probably have to do some auditing on our side of information because while, you know, we currently monitor our systems managers and above, we do not monitor anyone who's not a manager. And like I can tell you that Jerry and I probably keep the information at like 90 percent accuracy for managers and above. But the information which is done for our HR teams, for the non managers and above is probably like 60 percent accuracy last time we audited it. So we'd have to do full clean up of that and get them into… new rhythms. So that's why I was saying I'd like to, you know, start off lower and then move up so that we also have time to like get everything sorted on our side budgeting, like we're already paying for trying it until December.\nPricing\nCAITLIN\n18:28 \nAnd so if we were gonna purchase content like from a budget standpoint, we wouldn't be able to purchase it in the same year. We already purchased it with another company. So it would probably be that we'd start the content roll over and starting January 2024 which is why I also want to get Lisa's input to make sure when her contract ends with first for…\nPricing ends\nRICKY\n18:56 \nYeah, for sure. And we can absolutely work with you on that too if you want to get it in on a certain timeline, years two and three, that make sense?\nCAITLIN\n19:05 \nYeah. And so that would kind of be where I think the goal would be is that, you know, just because obviously with transitions you always have like that first year has the cost of one transitioning and to just get everyone familiar with the system.\nPricing\nCAITLIN\n19:24 \nSo I don't want to like break the boat by like biting off more than we can choose. So that's why I wanted to stay with our managers and then transition upwards. I just don't know realistically it'll be once we have once I know how many of our managers are logging in monthly, more consistently then I'll be able to get a better anticipation of what we're gonna need for our supervisors and above?\nPricing ends\nRICKY\n19:51 \nOkay, perfect. And we can work with that. And, you know, at the end of the day, we can work with some of these numbers to like my goal here is to give you the best price possible, but also the best value. So if we can do anything to help you get a little more in the fact that if you do get content, then we can certainly do some bundling as well. So just, I'm gonna keep in mind but, yeah.\nPricing\nCAITLIN\n20:12 \nI know it's one of our, the one of the companies goal to get all supervisors up. They wanted to that this year, but like they're also transitioning the HRIS system. So they're not gonna have time for that. But so I at least know that by next year, we definitely be up to like past 3,000 on a purely active user count.\nPricing ends\nCAITLIN\n20:37 \nAnd then, yeah. And then the rest is just gonna be based on, we just have to retrain a lot of our, which is the other thing I wanted to go over is like… and this will probably be more of talking with Brad is Permissions. He is very strict around past toward reset Permissions. But one of the biggest things we're gonna need to run into is that like and Jerry can testify, the person who does our tickets right now is that like people do not get password reset emails? Do you think that they would? But like 90 percent of our emails are just like, I don't know how to reset my password and we're like have you tried the button that says reset? So we need to look at how if we can do admin around our HR DS, being able to help out with tickets so that… we can increase our user amount without having to add more it specials?\nRICKY\n21:41 \nGot it. So this is just for my own knowledge, I guess, well, Brad will know if they can't do password resets. How are they getting passwords? If they can't log in? I mentioned, well, the SSO, it doesn't really matter so that you're thinking of the folks that like don't have the emails. I'm guessing.\nCAITLIN\n21:55 \nYeah. Well, if we did single sign in, then it wouldn't be an issue, right? Right? That be the same one. We don't currently use single sign in Cornerstone doesn't we didn't implement that with Cornerstone. So that's probably causing a lot. No, that's a good point. So if there's single sign in, then that wouldn't be an issue. Yeah, I totally forgot about that. Okay? So that's not an issue. So single sign in, yeah, if we did single sign in. Yeah. So then, yeah, then the only other thing I guess would be that would be a longer discussion is how we would do it for people who don't have emails.\nRICKY\n22:30 \nGot it. Yeah.\nCoach & Share\nRICKY\n22:31 \nAnd we can, does it make sense to have our team talk with Brad? We can certainly do that and answer a lot of his questions? I sent a link or SSO in the chat. You can certainly please pass that on to him. I know a lot of folks have found our knowledge base extremely helpful and straightforward, you can even search and look around the knowledge base as well. If he has any specific security or it questions, you can certainly pass that along to him.\nCoach & Share ends\nCAITLIN\n22:58 \nWell, this actually brings up a good question. So if you did single sign in and I apologize, I'm not familiar with single sign in at all. So if you do single sign in and then can like it's not like any email can really be controlled through the no, pastor resets can be controlled through the LMS, right? Because it's all connected to another system.\nRICKY\n23:21 \nExactly. Do you know if you guys use Octa or we do something?\nTIM\n23:24 \nI have, I've written down that you guys said last time you use doctor?\nRICKY\n23:28 \nThen it would be all through your of to setup.\nCAITLIN\n23:32 \nOkay, great. And then, yes.\nRICKY\n23:34 \nAnd then you would even have potentially if you wanted a like Docebo or you can even rename it on your Octa page for folks to just click on it and log on from there.\nCAITLIN\n23:43 \nYeah, no, that would help us. And then, yeah, I guess then the only thing and this would be less of a Brad question would be more of a technology question. On our side, is or not on the dog side is how we would treat people who didn't have emails if we wanted to go that route?\nUser Permission\nCAITLIN\n24:00 \nLike, is there a way that you could have like right now Cornerstone allows you to like manually type in like passwords and give them to them?\nRICKY\n24:09 \nYeah, you can do that.\nCAITLIN\n24:11 \nWould you be able to limit that to only people who don't have email address?\nRICKY\n24:14 \nI think it's only the admin super admin that can do that.\nUser Permission ends\nCAITLIN\n24:18 \nOkay.\nRICKY\n24:19 \nSo giving out like an email to someone who doesn't have like a password or a company email… there's different ways you can do it. It's something that's actually really strong with us. I mean, we work with a lot of folks that are either working with partners or customers.\nNotifications\nRICKY\n24:34 \nSo they don't have they're actually not even internal employees. So they don't have an email. So there's different ways to allow people to self register or the password. And that management would be done by the admin. Super admin.\nCAITLIN\n24:47 \nOkay. So that's the only thing, yeah, I think that's the only thing then we just have to figure out is because like I'm just trying to, if we expanded that outside after the people with work email addresses, I don't want it to like be like, you know, hundreds of associates writing our support team tickets, being like, hey, because then we have to email the HR S and be like, hey, can you give this person at this hotel who I don't know like an email or their log information?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Caitlin's goal is to get everyone with an email address onto the system in one year.\n• They need to do auditing as the current information accuracy for non-managers is only 60%. \n• The content rollover would start in January 2024 and they need Lisa's input. END"}
{"prompt":"CAITLIN\n33:43 \nYep. Yeah, no. So I was just asking because I just wanted to know because for, on what they're gonna be because that's the big thing is that we really wanted something that's easy for our leaders. And so I guess that's why I was, when I was going through the upload features, I was trying to test how easy it would be for them.\nRICKY\n34:08 \nYeah… no, I totally understand. I believe that's on the road map to start integrating everything kind of into the same ecosystem. But right now it's it is separate.\nCAITLIN\n34:21 \nThen on the road map, Rachel had one or two questions may also bring that up.\nOnboarding\nCAITLIN\n34:40 \nSo the one time fee, the onboarding. So… that's what this Professional services package of the one to three weeks, four to eight weeks, nine to 16 weeks. That is what is outlined in that gold onboarding.\nRICKY\n35:01 \nYeah, exactly. So our goal onboarding that's how it's broken down. You get 16 weeks with our team… essentially. And then at about a week 12, we usually see a soft launch so you can get it launched. And then we'll help you work out any kinks. Now, another thing I was gonna ask you if it makes sense or if you guys need any additional custom services because that's what I have there to be scoped if you had any tight deadlines, if you think you might need some additional help, we do provide services for that as well. And then what I would do is bring in our services team to kinda go through that with you?\nCAITLIN\n35:41 \nGive me one sec.\nCAITLIN\n35:48 \nYeah. And so then, so that 16 or nine to 16 weeks, does that include like discovery? Like not discovery, like training for like our Instructor, that would include training for our instructors on how to use the system?\nRICKY\n36:09 \nExactly. So in this 16 week process, it's actually your team is the hands on keyboard building it. Our team guides you. So by the end of it, anyone who's a part of the process will essentially be an expert on Docebo by the end of it. And then they guide you to build it. And at the very beginning, they do the kick off through the discovery, they understand what you're trying to achieve, what your goal is, what your even your design goal is and help you get there.\nOnboarding ends\nCAITLIN\n36:35 \nOkay, great. Yeah, because like obviously the main part is gonna be like our team, but then when we get towards the end, we'd like to do like training for like our property leaders who would be considered the instructors.\nRICKY\n36:50 \nYou guys also get access to Docebo university and you can sign up anyone within the org. So if there's any folks you need to learn about the system, our Docebo university has our own us using Docebo and it teaches you guys how to use the system, every single aspect of it as well. So you can bring in anyone you'd like anyone you think that might be working in it early on, certainly bring him in on the onboarding so they can get an understanding and, or also they can get log INS to Docebo university and start learning how to use the platform as well.\nIntegrations\nCAITLIN\n37:20 \nRate. And then… so when it comes to like transfers of information, so like if we had like, would you be expecting from us like this? Obviously the scorm files of the courses and.\nRICKY\n37:40 \nYeah. So that's actually something I want to talk to you about. So data migration from Cornerstone to Docebo. We do have migration services. It is an additional cost.\nOnboarding\nCAITLIN\n37:50 \nYeah.\nRICKY\n37:50 \nWhat I'll do is I'll send you over the migration document and essentially what that is for you to fill out and kinda just give us an idea of what it is you guys are looking to migrate. I'll actually bring it up now because I just wanna make sure I go through it with you. Are you looking to migrate? Like, do you have an idea of what you guys would like to migrate?\nOnboarding ends\nCAITLIN\n38:09 \nYeah, we have… a, I haven't actually written listed out.\nCAITLIN\n38:36 \nSo we have about…\nPricing\nCAITLIN\n38:48 \n155 online courses and 80 videos.\nRICKY\n38:56 \nOkay. It's not too much.\nCAITLIN\n38:58 \nAnd then we would have, and then we have training records for the majority of our courses for all of our associates since 2017. I know we have that all squared away but our eight and we might have some records as far back as 2014 for harassment training.\nCertifications\nRICKY\n39:22 \nGot it. So what we do, what we typically recommend for like record keeping essentially what we'll do in Docebo is will create a course shell essentially that won't have an actual like course in. It is essentially just a titled core with the records so that you just have the records there. And that all depends if you actually need the records in Docebo or not. Sometimes people are just happy with having the records in a file that they've taken from their previous one just from an auditing perspective. But really.\nCAITLIN\n39:52 \nA lot of ours is from like an auditing.\nRICKY\n39:55 \nExactly.\nCertifications ends\nRICKY\n39:56 \nSo it just depends if you wanted in the system or not. But essentially, what I'll do is I'll send you this and if you can fill it out to the best of your knowledge, I'll bring it back to our team and that's what they use to actually estimate the cost. What we're doing in this process is you're actually taking the, all the information you need from Cornerstone. So we're not, we don't touch that side of it. I don't know if you've had a conversation with Cornerstone around that sometimes they charge quite a bit for even just taking info out of.\nCAITLIN\n40:28 \nYeah, we have not done the Cornerstone because we're keeping performance. So we're having that conversation with them in March… but we wanted to, I mean, we've kind of been… knowing that Cornerstone is probably not going to provide us with as much information. I mean, they have good reporting. So like a lot of our history, like I can, that's what I wanted to ask because like sometimes you do LMS transfers, it's like they want like an excel document with certain like stuff this way. And that's kind of how they upload a lot of the information. Is that kind of what you guys would be doing?\nRICKY\n41:09 \nYeah, it would essentially be a CSV but that should be how they should give you the data as well. I just know that we've spoken to a few people and I think maybe one of them have mentioned that I think it was Cornerstone that they might give you the instructions to do it yourself or I think they might charge upwards as even 10 K to get the information out just to let you know. And maybe.\nCAITLIN\n41:36 \nNo, that wouldn't surprise me. We're kind of been anticipating that. I think the biggest thing would be like a lot of our records were like if you guys do excels, like, I know enough of our data that I could probably do it without them.\nRICKY\n41:57 \nYeah. So what we're doing is when, so when that info and that courses come out, we have like automated processes in place to essentially bring that into Docebo. So you can certainly. And I, it really all I guess depends on like how many courses you had. I've seen people do this with very few courses where our team is like, well, probably not worth it. It's probably easy for you guys to do it. But if you have a lot then it's easy for us to just kinda take that info and then we bring it and set it up within Docebo and populate the courses.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed onboarding needs for a single-time fee, the Professional Services package with a range of nine to sixteen weeks including discovery, training for instructors, access to Docebo University, and working out any kinks.\n• Data migration from Cornerstone to Docebo was mentioned, with information needing to be filled out before estimating the cost.\n• The team discussed certifications which could either be kept in Docebo or as a file from their previous LMS platform.\n• They discussed plans to bring automated processes into Docebo with help populating courses if needed. END"}
{"prompt":"RICKY\n42:25 \nAny sessions that you guys have learning objects, users and Branches as you usually a pretty big one. So how your hierarchy is built within Cornerstone if you wanted to bring that over. So if you have groups that are already like created within Cornerstone that you wanted to bring over things like that, we can do.\nBranches & Groups ends\nRICKY\n42:43 \nSo I'll let you take a look at this. It's not if you have questions definitely let me know if it's not uncommon that this could be sometimes a little confusing and we can certainly bring, I can bring Scott back on to go through it with you. But I'm gonna send this to you after this anyways. And essentially what we do is we take the info on this to get an estimate of what that would cost for us to help you bring it in.\nCAITLIN\n43:04 \nOkay. So I'm just looking through these. So users that would be, yeah, that would be or the amount of people we're bringing over what is Branches again?\nBranches & Groups\nRICKY\n43:15 \nSo the Branches is in our user management. So the Branches is what mimics your HR system.\nCAITLIN\n43:21 \nGot it.\nRICKY\n43:22 \nAnd the hierarchy, the groups are any potential custom groups you may have made in Cornerstone?\nCAITLIN\n43:29 \nOkay. So yeah, I have all that, we have those listed as divisions. And then I have all of our groups subdivided and listed out. So like we do everything obviously by job codes. So like I have the list of all the job codes right now that would be eligible through our fee. Then I have how they're broken out based on the division. And then I could, which I guess would be Branches. And then the custom groups. So if we sent you over being like this is what this group is called, these are all the job codes within it. I have that as well.\nRICKY\n44:07 \nYeah, that's perfect. Actually. So catalogs, we call them catalogs, but essentially that's like your grouping of courses like almost like your self enrollment.\nBranches & Groups ends\nRICKY\n44:18 \nSo depending if you have those or not, if you don't have some of these, you don't have to, you don't have to put a number here just in mind too.\nCAITLIN\n44:25 \nWe have, we have that we have all. And so we have… let me see… it is.\nCAITLIN\n44:41 \nLet me just see if this is what you mean. I have them here.\nCAITLIN\n45:03 \nSorry, I'm not great with.\nRICKY\n45:07 \nNo worries.\nCAITLIN\n45:08 \nZoom. I'm having trouble just finding out how you share your screen in Zoom.\nRICKY\n45:12 \nIt should be right at the bottom, you see green?\nCAITLIN\n45:23 \nSure. Okay. And then can you guys see, so we have this listed out for each of our different positions, which lists kind of what when, so this would be our sellers and we also have the job codes associated. So this is our directors of sales leaders. And so it says exactly which courses they get the type.\nLearning Plans\nJORI\n45:50 \nOkay.\nCAITLIN\n45:51 \nIt's description and it's time. So we have this for all of our positions written. Now. Is this what you're looking for catalog?\nRICKY\n46:02 \nYeah. I think so, are those the courses on the, in columeyes?\nCAITLIN\n46:07 \nSo, these are the courses?\nRICKY\n46:10 \nYou have some ILT, so I see that. So you'll see on the sheet that it breaks it down between ILT.\nCourse Enrollment\nRICKY\n46:17 \nSo how many ILT you want to bring over? And what that means is how many ILT S with the course title, the course code, the description, things like that have already been built out that you want to bring over?\nCAITLIN\n46:30 \nYeah.\nRICKY\n46:32 \nAlso have the option for enrollment. So if you want to bring over any ILT that people have already been enrolled in Cornerstone, we could do that too, or if you just wanted to just bring over the courses and then start a new really comes down to what you wanna do.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRICKY\n46:46 \nAnd then you'll see it goes. It breaks down how you want to bring those ILT over. And then the learning objects is your video and your scoring files. So we count all any learning object is something that's not an ILT? So a video, a scorm HTML document, PDF, anything like that you want to bring over that can just be consolidated to one number?\nCAITLIN\n47:08 \nOkay. So here, could you re, share your screen? So, sorry, I could just see that sheet again?\nRICKY\n47:14 \nYeah, for sure. I'm going to send it over to you as well. Let's make sure I got that… perfect.\nCAITLIN\n47:21 \nGot it. So the catalog is kind of like the collection of trainings that you want assign together.\nLearning Plans\nRICKY\n47:27 \nYeah, exactly that. So the catalog would be new course higher training, and then all the courses that are in.\nCAITLIN\n47:36 \nGot it. Yup. And then, so then what's the difference between the E learning courses and the learning objects?\nRICKY\n47:45 \nSo the E learning courses would be the course shell. So it's the course itself. So if you say new hire training course one that's an E learning course, the learning object is what goes into that course.\nCAITLIN\n48:02 \nGot it. Okay. So that would be a little, okay. So that's fine because right now all of our, just how Cornerstone works, all of our learning objects are separate courses because like putting them together is very, I think except like our new harassment training is the only thing where it's like multiple courses within one shell.\nRICKY\n48:24 \nYeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I think we did talk about that. Yeah. So essentially, this is just the actual document scoring itself. The E learning course is. So I mean if they mimic each other, I've seen people do that too. That's okay. Like I have 20 courses and 20 learning objects because each learning objects its own course that's the whole point for us is to be able to understand how that hierarchy works when we migrated over.\nCAITLIN\n48:49 \nYeah. Yeah. No, I mean, that's obviously something I'd like to do more shells once we got over. But that's not going to be hard on like the bringing over because we haven't been able to do that based on how they do curriculums. It's very confusing.\nRICKY\n49:04 \nGot it.\nCAITLIN\n49:05 \nTheir systems. So we've had to just avoid them. So like, yeah, everything is a singular object right now.\nRICKY\n49:12 \nOkay. We…\nCAITLIN\n49:14 \nThere's not even like it's not even like pathways as you guys talk about it. It's literally everything is assigned individually and managed individually.\nRICKY\n49:23 \nGot it. Now. The one thing I'm not 100 percent sure. So when we create the course, I'm not sure if we're actually putting the object into that course. I think that might have to be done once it's created. I can confirm that.\nLearning Plans ends\nCAITLIN\n49:39 \nAnd then here, I'm just bringing up. Sorry, I got disconnected from… because I've been trying to compile all this stuff in our own excels using Cornerstone because again, like you said, I, I've been.\nCAITLIN\n50:02 \nA little timid on what they're going to bring over for us.\nRICKY\n50:05 \nRight.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ricky provided information about hierarchies, branches and groups in Cornerstone.\n• Caitlin glanced through the information and asked questions to clarify.\n• Ricky explained they would be taking the info to get an estimate of cost for migrating it over.\n• He also tailored down to ILT, E-learning courses, learning objects, catalogs and enrollment.  END"}
{"prompt":"CAITLIN\n50:08 \nSo I have, let me bring this up.\nCertifications\nRICKY\n50:22 \nActually, here, while you're doing that, the E learning course enrollments… this is the historical data.\nRICKY\n50:38 \nI just wanna make sure that makes sense because what we do from a historical data typically or I'd say, yeah, most of the time we're bringing in an E learning course. So compliance training 2017, they'll create the course. It's a core shell called compliance training 2017 with the enrollments and everyone who was enrolled in that. There's no learning object in there. It's literally just a core shell. And the whole point is so that you have the historical tracking record data in… it.\nCAITLIN\n51:07 \nOkay, great. Yeah. What we're doing on ours right now is what we're doing in Cornerstone is reviewing all of our active scorm to make sure when they're working. And then we're doing a mass resync of the records and Cornerstone. So like once we know that scorm is good, we re upload it and then there's an option where we can like be like all right now, you can re sync the records so that this now has one ID for everyone who's possibly taken the history.\nCertifications ends\nCAITLIN\n51:35 \nSo we're gonna do that for all of our courses before like moving. And that way all of the records, it won't be like this was previously named this in this year or this was previously called this. And it's a bilateral completion of this. Like we should have full syncing for everything with one ID. And then we also have this.\nCAITLIN\n52:04 \nThis is kind of similar to what I've been basing this off of obviously the… what we had to do when we are doing on corner. I know we're way over time. So if you guys have to leave…\nRICKY\n52:16 \nI'm good. I'm happy to get this to go over. This is why.\nCAITLIN\n52:29 \nSure. I'm just on you don't have the master record open right now, right?\nJORI\n52:37 \nNo, I don't…\nCAITLIN\n52:39 \nI just wanted to know because I'm gonna.\nJORI\n52:43 \nOkay. Sounds good.\nCAITLIN\n52:45 \nSo this is our sheet. It'll give you. It tells us kind of all the trainings, which type gives the title and this is just showing us active, but it'll give us the subject. We would need all of them being listed under. It will give us the time it gives the description, it gives the keywords, the language it's currently offered in. And then it will also say which group as you guys put, it would be assigned to it, which day period as well as it's individual learning object ID. You guys won't need the versions. But it will also give you what the name of the scorm is that's attached to each?\nRICKY\n53:30 \nOkay. Yeah, that's great.\nCAITLIN\n53:33 \nAs well if there's any prerequisites or equivalents for each one.\nRICKY\n53:41 \nGot it. Yeah, that's great.\nCAITLIN\n53:43 \nSo we should, this is our plan to have this done in the next like two to three weeks and then we have to redo some obviously some different scorm so that's probably going to be our March is just redoing the scorm on our side and then starting kind of this actual move over… in April, I guess would be like the big thing.\nOnboarding\nRICKY\n54:16 \nYeah. You can do the migration really at any time. I think typically people have to build it out a little bit and then migrated in, yeah.\nCAITLIN\n54:25 \nSo, like because I know you guys give like a 16 week period if we like did the like, you know, contracts and everything in March, would we be able to like hold off on doing the actual like onboarding until like April?\nRICKY\n54:42 \nYeah, for sure. So once the contract is signed, there typically is about three weeks before starting anyway, just from the QQ perspective. So it is about two to three weeks. So I guess it might be three weeks now with queue. But before starting that and it doesn't mean when you sign the contract that the onboarding starts, the kick off is when it starts with, the account manager will go over that.\nNext Steps\nCAITLIN\n55:08 \nGreat. Yeah, because we have Cornerstone until this September 20 third. So if we started in April with you guys, that would mean that we'd be pretty much done by August, which would give us 30 days of transition period on our side, I mean, the last time we did this, I came in and they're like, hey, you guys transition day is the 20 sixth and your old system ends on the first of the next month and it was February. So I had twentieth. So we had two days. Hey, well.\nOnboarding\nRICKY\n55:44 \nThat you're planning ahead now. So this is, it's critical to plan ahead the sow for this migration as well. It is separate from like that 16 weeks. So it's whenever it's ready to be done.\nCAITLIN\n55:54 \nYeah, no. But if you could give us, if you could send me that sheet, I'll fill it out.\nOnboarding ends\nCAITLIN\n55:58 \nThat's the biggest thing on the data transfer is, I mean we have everything kind of listed out based on kind of like knowing. So it's not like we have all the, we had to redo all of our feeds for Cornerstone in… November of this year. So like I have written out being like these are the people that fall within this division that fall within this, that fall within that we have that all lined out.\nNotifications\nCAITLIN\n56:27 \nSo, and then we have the group… one that shows you kind of… I have them here. I have another. Yeah, I just wanted to know if these were good templates kind of because these are kind of the templates they had us use. I've been kind of time in a, but if you guys have preferred templates that you want this information to be put in, that makes it easier.\nNotifications ends\nCAITLIN\n56:56 \nI'd rather get that from you now so we can start using those rather than like doing these based on like the Cornerstone logic and then being like we need to transfer this over.\nRICKY\n57:07 \nYeah. For sure. I have… there's another document I sent over that kinda goes over how the CSV should be set up.\nCAITLIN\n57:18 \nGreat. Yeah.\nRICKY\n57:20 \nShouldn't be too. Honestly, it shouldn't be too different than what, how Cornerstone would give it to you. I think it's pretty universal.\nCAITLIN\n57:29 \nAnd then we have all of our groups. So the groups have… their overall title. Then they're just ID that we currently use. And then the description includes all the different numbers and positions that currently go on each one.\nRICKY\n57:49 \nPerfect. I mean that at the end of the day, this is going to really help you be able to fill out the document. This is actually credibly organized.\nCAITLIN\n57:59 \nYeah, we have to, we have to have everything done and we technically redid our entire structural changes when it came to job codes in 2021. And I was part of that group. So I know exactly how many… I think we have technically around 400… and 98 available job codes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Caitlin and Ricky discussed the process of enrolling in an e-learning course and its historical data tracking. \n• They reviewed existing scorms to make sure they are working properly and recommended a mass resync for all records with one ID. \n• They discussed the process of onboarding, including signing contracts and waiting for three weeks prior to kick off. \n• Caitlin provided templates for notification as well as groups with overall titles, IDs, descriptions and job codes.

{"prompt":"RICKY\n58:24 \nGot it. Okay?\nCAITLIN\n58:26 \nThat are split between 65 different groups. So awesome. So, yeah, I think.\nRICKY\n58:37 \nAwesome. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna send over like I mentioned, the legal, I'm gonna send over the migration document. A couple of other things I think that might be helpful. I know that there's a few things I've jotted down that you have to do on your side. Now that because we're I guess halfway through the month, do you mind if we do like maybe a weekly check in to yeah, just make sure that we're on track?\nCAITLIN\n58:55 \nThat would definitely be helpful. And then I'm gonna do a call next week kind of with our leaders because… I just had them, I think I sent you, but I just had that, I've been sending them that link that for Shape that I found on your guy's website. It was the YouTube I wanted to just send that besides our marketing, our design, get this new title. A couple of our leaders that Rachel has picked out on usage for that to get their idea of Shape.\nRICKY\n59:27 \nIf they need to have a call with us too, like feel free to if they just want to go through some stuff with us. I always like to make sure that like we're you know, we're there to help guide. I don't want people to get frustrated with things in case it happens. So just definitely let me know if you need us to hop on with anybody.\nCAITLIN\n59:46 \nMy only question would be is, can you turn off the artificial intelligence? Like when you're uploading a deck or not turn it off, but like it always minimizes it right there's. Never an option where you could just be like, I just want all the information in as.\nRICKY\n1:00:05 \nThat's a good question. I'm not sure because I know you can create it from scratch. Like there is an option to do that, and that might allow you to upload it.\nCAITLIN\n1:00:12 \nYeah, I know you can do that. I played around with that. I was just wondering like, you know, one of our guys was like, hey now I, I've already created kind of a powerpoint of this and I like this powerpoint. So I want everything like just these points to appear as is there a way I could just upload it? I mean, obviously they could do it as like a PDF or something into the actual system, but a lot of times people like to do, you know, other stuff.\nRICKY\n1:00:45 \nYeah. I guess that would be my suggestion is just uploaded as it is if it's a, if it's a powerpoint… I don't think you can turn that off mainly because the whole point of it is to create a more concise, I guess output. But yeah, what would be their purposes? It because they wanna add like music or translation or things like that?\nCAITLIN\n1:01:10 \nI think it would just be if they were just like, hey, I have this written out. It's not, it's like some of the revenue stuff can get a little more complicated. So, like when I did like our ownership letter, I tested out and like when you uploaded it, it's definitely a lot of like harder concepts. And like, while the a, I did a good job at, it would definitely require some like updates. And so I could see them being like, hey, is there an option where I can just upload it as is and not have it reward for me? Because that would be, I'd say like for some of our more complex ones, they could be like, well, I don't feel like the AI is getting the concept as well as I would like.\nRICKY\n1:01:54 \nI totally understand. I'll see if there's a LCO team, if there's an option for that.\nCAITLIN\n1:02:01 \nYeah, no, cause like it just ranges on the different stuff. Like obviously, you're talking about guest satisfaction. The biggest thing is just being like make sure they're happy versus.\nRICKY\n1:02:09 \nTalking.\nCAITLIN\n1:02:10 \nAbout revenue trends. They like give being like, well, based on these results from this month in this quarter, this led to this and like that stuff that if it's like accidentally mis spoken, like can get, that was the only thing I think I noticed with that. And then, yeah, I…\nRICKY\n1:02:28 \nYeah, because what I will say is this at the end of the day Shape is gonna get you maybe like 80 percent of the way there. You're probably gonna have you're gonna have to go in there and make some manual edits just to make sure everything is as is the pictures are the way you want them to be.\nCAITLIN\n1:02:43 \nYeah, no, no, I get that. And I like that it allows you to kind of have like a one and done sort of thing where you can kind of like it gets you going and it's not like, you know, because obviously, it's not like we're gonna be using it. It's mostly going to be our leaders who are not involved in like is doing as many trainings. So, I like the fact that it creates something for you that like minimizes the amount of work you have because like our head of revenue is not gonna like put the time in to be like I'm now going to create a very diligent 30 minute presentation, but that was just the one question I had is if there was an option to turn off the AI if you had a shorter thing and you wanted to just upload it directly besides obviously just creating one and uploading it or like and entering it, slide by slide.\nRICKY\n1:03:36 \nYeah, it makes sense. I'll take that back. I also got a response. It looks like when you do go live and you have Shape, it looks like you can, it will be linked in that you can send content over when it's published.\nCAITLIN\n1:03:50 \nRate, that would be super helpful for our leaders because the amount that they have to do from an assignment perspective is going to be like better.\nRICKY\n1:04:00 \nYeah. So, yeah. So it looks like they'll still have to go into Shape, create it. But then once the LMS is live, they can be linked in. You can just bring it over instead of downloading it uploading it.\nCAITLIN\n1:04:10 \nAwesome. And then… can you do voice overs in Shape? I saw that you can have audio, but you can do voice overs, okay?\nRICKY\n1:04:21 \nYou can do a, I, voice overs or you can do your own voice over.\nCAITLIN\n1:04:24 \nOkay, great.\nRICKY\n1:04:26 \nAnd the AI does translate, but I think it's only a few languages right now.\nCAITLIN\n1:04:29 \nYeah, it's pretty. It had a lot. I think the only one that I saw that we would need, I think we had this in a previous one would be Arabic.\nRICKY\n1:04:39 \nRight. Yes, I think that's it's actually still on the road.\nCAITLIN\n1:04:44 \nI understand that that's a harder language. Yeah. And.\nRICKY\n1:04:48 \nWe weren't we weren't…\nCAITLIN\n1:04:49 \nJust just surprised as that like Arabic actually was like our third requested language like we had on our docket, obviously, English, Spanish, and then French, and then Chinese and it was like, no, we need Arabic. I was like, okay.\nRICKY\n1:05:05 \nWe do have it for the LMS. I know that we looked at that last time.\nCAITLIN\n1:05:09 \nYeah. All right. Great. And… then I think the last one I had was just, I'm looking at the assignment.\nRICKY\n1:05:22 \nThe assignment feature for like recording screen?\nCAITLIN\n1:05:25 \nFor actually assigning courses?\nRICKY\n1:05:28 \nFor assigning courses from an admin perspective?\nCAITLIN\n1:05:31 \nYeah, I'm currently sharing, right?\nRICKY\n1:05:35 \nI'm on the wrong thing. Yes, you are not as my bad, no.\nCAITLIN\n1:05:38 \nFine. I realized I've been sharing for the last 15 minutes. So, you guess this?\nRICKY\n1:05:43 \nActually, I had the screen off… but yes, I can see the log in there. So the assignments assigning courses?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ricky and Caitlin discussed the process of splitting up different groups, with Ricky offering to send over the legal and migration documents.\n• They agreed to do a weekly check-in to make sure they were on track.\n• Caitlin asked if there was an option to upload content without using the AI feature, and Ricky agreed to look into it.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"CAITLIN\n1:13:56 \nYeah, that's gonna be my thing for I'm waiting to just hear from Lisa next week. And then I'm gonna be meeting with Brad the week after that.\nRICKY\n1:14:06 \nAwesome. Okay. Well, like I said, I'd still love to do even a weekly check in even if it's literally quick checking. I just wanna make sure things are up because I will send over legal and perhaps or some questions there. So I guess we can set it up right now is our time next week that works. I'm pretty up.\nCAITLIN\n1:14:23 \nYeah. Let me see. Can we do Monday?\nRICKY\n1:14:28 \nI'm actually off on Monday, it's a Canadian holiday, believe it or not?\nSmall Talk\nCAITLIN\n1:14:31 \nReally?\nRICKY\n1:14:32 \nThe family day, don't ask me why, but I'll take it.\nJORI\n1:14:35 \nThat's nice, right? Yeah.

Why don't we do Tuesday? I might have to, sorry, I'm getting potentially that you hall and I know it's happening sometime between… the 20 first to the 20 fifth. I don't know which date it's happening yet. So if…\nRICKY\n1:15:20 \nWe can adjust it if needed for sure.\nCAITLIN\n1:15:22 \nYeah, but I'm guessing it's going to be later in the week. So I'd rather like to do… the 20 first.\nRICKY\n1:15:29 \nOkay, perfect. I'll put it in half an hour. We'll keep it as a sync check in. Any other questions that pop up, but I just want to keep this moving and make sure that we.\nCAITLIN\n1:15:38 \nYeah, no, definitely. Yeah, no, we.\nRICKY\n1:15:41 \nAnytime. Is there?\nCAITLIN\n1:15:43 \nWe're free anytime jury. Is there any, my calendar is free from 12 to five that day? Jury? Where are you at?\nJORI\n1:15:52 \nFor Tuesday, the same for the 20 first? Yeah. So.\nRICKY\n1:15:58 \nI'll put two o'clock works really good, right?\nCAITLIN\n1:16:01 \nLet me see if there's any time that Rachel's available, she might wanna talk to you?\nRICKY\n1:16:07 \nYeah, for sure. Actually, one o'clock is the best.\nCAITLIN\n1:16:15 \nDo you have any time between 12 to one on that date?\nRICKY\n1:16:21 \nYeah, for sure. And if she joins, would you want me to bring in our content team too?\nCAITLIN\n1:16:27 \nNo, Rachel.\nRICKY\n1:16:29 \nYeah.\nCAITLIN\n1:16:31 \nRachel is our chief operating officer, so I've shown her and done kind of the demo with this system. She was on one of the other calls we did with HR, but I don't know if we've done like a one on one with her, so.\nRICKY\n1:16:44 \nShe…\nCAITLIN\n1:16:44 \nProbably has her own questions, so, I think, and she's free from one to 12 on that date, which is very like rare for her. And that's actually from 12 to one is actually the only time she is available all next week that's open.\nNotifications\nRICKY\n1:17:04 \nI'm gonna send that out to you right now. I'll take that.\nCAITLIN\n1:17:07 \nInclude her on it. Her email is, let me just chat you her email address so you could just put her on the invite directly just because sometimes when I forward step, it appears as optional and…\nRICKY\n1:17:22 \nYeah. We have that issue or a one we're on G suite here, which I'm not used to in the fort.\nNotifications ends\nCAITLIN\n1:17:28 \nOn G suite. Now, we're on or on teams?\nRICKY\n1:17:31 \nIs that like outlook chest?\nCAITLIN\n1:17:32 \nYeah.\nNext Steps\nCAITLIN\n1:17:49 \nNo, that is not.\nCAITLIN\n1:17:57 \nAll right. So I just chatted you her email. So if you could put her on that be great because we're meeting with her on Monday to do discussions. So then if she has any questions on Tuesday, that'd be great. And then, yeah, and then we'll probably have to set up a time with our, it probably not the week after that to go over single sign in and kinda their admin stuff around that.\nNext Steps ends\nCAITLIN\n1:18:24 \nI know we already did our call with HR. They didn't really have any concerns. Their biggest thing is they're just trying to do single sign in. Brad is more going to be like if we expanded past the current amount we have, how we would treat that. They'll also have a lot of other security questions with you. And… just on the case, Brad is very straightforward just giving you the heads up now.\nRICKY\n1:18:52 \nI love it. Trust me from an it perspective. Love the straightforwardness we're going to have with that discussion. I bring in my solution architect and they're all pretty straightforward.\nCAITLIN\n1:19:04 \nOkay, great. Yeah.\nRICKY\n1:19:05 \nOf few people, they.\nCAITLIN\n1:19:09 \nYeah, I don't try to say anything on that because like I just don't understand it as much. And like Brad's questions that if I contact him that he'll ask me to, I'll be like, I think I'm asking this correctly. So, yeah, I'll try to a meeting with him for the next.\nRICKY\n1:19:22 \nYeah, that's why we love having these calls too. Because even if we start doing the whole chain from the top of the, it to I guess yourself to me like I'll probably lose a lot in translation, sending it to the sa team. So I just like to put them together and pass it out and honestly send them the knowledge base. It's I think it's usually really helpful especially for a pre meeting. And then they'll just come in with the questions that he really needs.\nCAITLIN\n1:19:48 \nGreat. Yeah, no, I'm just, it's been hard because like I said, with the transition hotels, Brad sites every single one of them. So he hasn't just been in office until this week.\nWrap-Up\nRICKY\n1:19:59 \nAnd that would be a good time actually to have the conversation around that, the email and best practices on registering and stuff and how we do it. All right?\nCAITLIN\n1:20:07 \nAwesome. Well, this is all. Thank you so much for taking all the time we will go through those guides that you provided. And if we have any questions then we'll let you know.\nNext Steps\nRICKY\n1:20:19 \nYeah, reach out any time. Like obviously, I wanna keep a weekly sync for, so that we connect. But if any time you just want to hop in and, you know, if you're going through this, the trial itself and you're getting frustrated with something, just shoot me a note.\nWrap-Up\nCAITLIN\n1:20:32 \nOkay, great. Yeah. And then if you also give me that other think you sent me that other document that I need to fill out so we can get the pricing on that. Yeah, awesome. Then I will fill that all out and send that back to you. And then we, yeah, and then we should be good.\nRICKY\n1:20:51 \nAmazing.\nCAITLIN\n1:20:53 \nAll right.

{"prompt":"FREDDY\n0:01 \nOkay.\nJAMES\n0:02 \nSo, I think there sounds like there are some nuances with this specific piece of Salesforce data, right? The, this user unique identifier. I kind of agree with Michael here that if that exists somewhere and it's already mapped between Docebo user and their Salesforce representative user as well, we shouldn't really have any issues at that point.\nIntegrations\nJAMES\n0:25 \nHowever, I think what I would like to do just to be very sure to be 100 percent sure is engaged with our solutions architecture team just to, you know, to get into the real nitty gritty of, you know, some of the behind the scenes processes to ensure that all of that data between the users and Salesforce remains intact as we start to discuss this headless solution or learn data. I see there being no issue in honesty, but let's get a full and technical confirmation of that. Now learn data as a product from Docebo. Isn't necessarily something that we can demonstrate nor show because it's data. Okay? It's a flow of data between systems. So I don't have anything whizzy or banging or impressive to show you at this point. But what I can do is talk about how it works and perhaps we can start to understand how it might be beneficial for you. So I'll call it the headless solution for now just because it's easier than saying learned data all over again. The idea is that Docebo will be using snowflake to mind the data to go into the tables or our SQL tables in the back end of Docebo to grab onto the information. It is not necessary on your side also to use snowflake. So what we have is sort of three prerequisites to ensure that you as a customer will make great use of learned data, the headless solution with no problems. And those three things I'll start with resourcing on your side, you will need to have a person or teams who understand data and mapping and minding that way, I think there is no problem from your side there. You have plenty of resources to understand data and new things. So that's sort of one thing kicked off. The second thing that you will need is some kind of data warehouse, whether that be snowflake or Amazon's one which name read something which escaped my mind. But anyway, you need to have some kind of data warehouse in order for this data to be placed into. And then finally, and quite importantly, you will also need some kind of data visualization tool, a Power B, I, a Tableau or something along those lines. And they are really are three prerequisites. At this point for you to make use of learned data because learn data as a product is extracting the important information for Docebo and then giving it to you in its raw format. Therefore, you can do whatever you like with that. You can remind it again using your own data warehouse or your sort of data to, and then you can place it into some kind of very fancy visualizations on the other side and a bit like something like, you know, Tableau or whether you use Salesforce for your front end. In terms of data visualization, everything can be pulled through into that front end. And you can use all the other data that exists in your Salesforce, that exists in your HR system that exist anywhere else. Okay? So that's the kind of 10,000 for overview of learned data. I think what I would quite like to ask is, if we had access to all of this raw data, what would you want to do with it? What visualizations? You know, what mappings would you like to do to get out of that data?\nFREDDY\n4:02 \nOn my side, just to give you some ideas, what we're trying to achieve is to enable us to profile our sales reps in terms of how well are they doing on the learning, both in terms of the level of completion of the assigned cost, that the one we, they are must do whether it's fundamental or intermediate or advanced.\nCertifications\nFREDDY\n4:24 \nEventually, we also need to find out complete that profile by having an understanding of what else that rep has done outside of what's required, and also how well they've done on those level of completion or pass rate. Or if there's a test at the end, we'd like to leverage that.\nCertifications ends\nFREDDY\n4:43 \nSo all of these together will allow us to kind of define groups of reps and to separate out the one that are really advanced on they are training overall. And then we'll move on to segment in terms of type of training and to really have the full view of what, you know, how they, how they're performing on their learning? And also then connect that to, are they also leveraging all the other pulse elements? And ultimately, are they winning? Are they selling? Are they achieving the target? Do we have correlation? Do we have cases where a certain rep or region is doing really well on all these elements and also have a great impact on their sales? That could then be used as? Okay, these are the one that we need to reach out for best practice. And is there anything that they're doing that could be shared with the rest ultimately is to allow us to get that view of how are they doing on the learning? And how does the impact the bottom line?\nJAMES\n5:41 \nYeah, Freddy, that's that sounds excellent. And, you know, as you went through that journey of is the learner performing very well. I started well, that's just LMS data. And then all of a sudden we have this sort of sales data that needs to come in afterwards, which again helps you with that correlation.\nIntegrations\nJAMES\n5:56 \nSo as long as you have both of these data sets and I can confirm all of the learning data will of course, exist within a, as long as you can confirm that you have the sales data on the other side, yes, you can start making visualizations a bit like what Jackie is showing on the screen here, the Salesforce dashboards that I can see just on the right hand side of the screen, you can make those correlations because we're feeding you all of this raw data.\nPricing\nJAMES\n6:20 \nSo what we'll that there are a number of tables that we give you access to the numbers around 120 or 150 tables in the back end of Docebo. And that will grow over time. But we have identified the most important tables with the data in that makes sense from a learning perspective for now.\nCoach & Share\nJAMES\n6:38 \nAnd then you map that with whatever data that you have on your side. Now, how would you then help people share their knowledge? Let's say that you can start to identify these let's call them top performers. What are your ideas on being able to get them to share back into the organization?\nCoach & Share ends\nFREDDY\n6:59 \nThat probably be a second effect of having an ability to identify those persons. And then we'll have to dis, okay, we know who the best top class learners are and have an impact on their sales. That that's really is the main thing. And it's just, I don't think we thought through an actual mechanism there to kind of similar to we've got that on the sales, excellent side. We knew from the data that there was a couple of region that performed really well. So they would typically be the one we would go to and say, okay, well, I see you've done really well. Would you have some best practice or someone who's leveraging the pulse platform best? Then maybe they could be called in to do… kind of a best, you know, history of how they're doing successor on how they're doing and how it impacts their business and to get more engagement from other maybe users that may not be at the same level. But the real that's kind of more anecdotal, what we really want to be able to see is the impact of learning, why are we investing so much time in learning? You know, do we see a correlation between what's the good learners? And we probably would have to group them together? Because you might have one very good learner who's doing really poorly on their sales. That doesn't mean learning is bad. And equally, you could have someone super experienced that doesn't leverage any of the learning and still manage too much to match their target. If we group them together, the trend should tell the truth and look at of all the top performer on average, they are all achieving all over achieving on their sales, equally, the lower side of… the less performance on the learning side also have on average a lower performance on their sales.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Freddy explained the desired outcome of the project, including understanding how well the reps are performing on their learning, leveraging other pulse elements, correlating their performance to sales targets, and identifying best practices that can be shared among all reps. END"}
{"prompt":"FREDDY\n8:51 \nSo that's kind of why we want to that's why I mentioned the profiling of the groups of reps and slicing as well by region that could be useful by, you know, is there some trend that we see within the region versus another region, pitching them one against each other a little bit?\nBranches & Groups ends\nJAMES\n9:07 \nFrom…\nFREDDY\n9:07 \nHealthy competition, you know, that kind of thing?\nJAMES\n9:11 \nYeah, yeah. I…\nJACKY\n9:13 \nI you.\nFREDDY\n9:14 \nAnyway, but.\nJAMES\n9:14 \nAs, yeah.\nJACKY\n9:15 \nIn best case, Tray, we have discussed that we would have some HR data is also behind that saying how long is this learner with us already? And what is the background for sure?\nAbout Docebo\nJACKY\n9:26 \nWe could keep it quite easy. I would say med tech background, yes, no. And then it's an onboard or it's more than five years. So we can also make categories there because that would be also interesting to see. What does it mean? Someone makes all the learning is 20 years with origin and another person is let's say two years with origin.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJACKY\n9:48 \nAlso in learning, is there a difference? Do we have a difference performance? What do we see in sales, right? So that would be also additional data that would be really nice outside of the, for sure but on our side to have the correlation with that.\nFREDDY\n10:05 \nAnd that's something that go back to this requirement, having that unique identifier connection because this is something we're tracking on our user profile, the start date that's something we brought in. So, you know, we have a field within seo that allow us to capture when they were first on boarded. So we've got, we've caught up on most of the user and it's part now of the routine of creating a new user. We're going to have to create their start date, which should be quite obvious when we create the new user, which should know straight away. So that is another key element. I didn't mention time to first deal, time to ramp up. Are we shrinking the ramp up time when we are very good on the learning versus new starter? That may not be so good on the learning? Maybe they'll take longer to reach.\nAbout Docebo\nFREDDY\n10:49 \nAnd there's all sorts of other target. The revenue is obviously the final, the one we want to connect to. But there's all the rest, you know, do they focus on the ipo? Do they have opportunity? What is the close rate? What is the sales cycle? All of the, all of those things will become available to collaborate or to collect with learning data via that unique identify if we don't have that's why it's so important.\nMobile App\nJAMES\n11:13 \nAmazing. Amazing Jackie. Just to let you know you're still sharing your screen?\nJACKY\n11:18 \nYeah, I'm trying but.\nJAMES\n11:19 \nJust in case you in.\nJACKY\n11:21 \nNo, you have here. My, that's my, yeah, it's loading my Zoom is loading. So I can cannot go.\nJAMES\n11:29 \nI think what I'll do, I can, I think you, which will take it away from you. And then I'll hack in the back.\nMobile App ends\nJACKY\n11:39 \nSince we have no longer the Zoom contract, Zoom is obviously does not like longer.\nEMER\n11:47 \nIt's against.\nJAMES\n11:49 \nWell, Freddy, look, I think you, you've told a very good story there and to let you know that some of the data coverage in terms of user additional fields will be pulled through as well. So you will be able to get that higher date or start date to whatever that is into your data systems as well. I like that idea of sort of time to first deal, maybe size of first deal on average contract values and all that sort of thing. So you'll be able to, you'll absolutely be able to do that. I'm just trying to think apart from time to first say, you know, we're thinking very sort of strategically on a revenue basis here. Are there any other objectives that you would like to try and hit? Not necessarily associated to Salesforce data but perhaps somewhere else more sort of HR related, not necessarily performance related, but, you know, the happiness of your employees in terms of their MPS against the company working with you and things like that. Just trying to build a wider picture than what's maybe behind revenue.\nIntegrations\nSAMANTHA\n12:49 \nJames, I just want to pause here for a second because I don't see how this particular tool adds any benefit. We already have access to all the raw data from the cheer. So, you know, from what I understand so far from what you guys have said, there's no additional calculation, no additional table that you're helping us to pay because you don't have access to sales data, for example.\nCustom Reports\nSAMANTHA\n13:16 \nSo there is there's no way that you guys can help us… build that report or that dashboard in Salesforce. You're just giving us the raw data that we already have. You know, the data we already have that in a different format, we can get it from a different place, but we'd need to, you know, take it from that place and input it into your system in order for you to give us that on raw data. So it's not really making sense right now.\nJAMES\n13:42 \nYeah, Sam, I definitely hear you at that point there. So let me just be very clear. There are lots of ways of extracting data out of Docebo. However you're usually confined to the limits that Docebo gives you in terms of the tables you can get access to. So, for example, a users courses report is something that you can get access to, but it is closed just to users and courses and it might not then pull in other sources of information that you need.\nIntegrations\nJAMES\n14:11 \nAnd this is where we need to collaborate together to say what data do you need out of Docebo that perhaps you aren't getting now and how will that data be fed into something like Salesforce? Because if you're already getting all of the data required to make these kind of match up the time the first sale in terms of performance, then no, I don't think we do need the headless solution.\nCustom Reports\nJAMES\n14:42 \nHowever if there are limitations for the data that we are feeding you because you can only pull it through so many a P is, and that's not working quite so well. Then the headless solution is better because it gives you access to all of the data. We can provide something like a query builder, which we call a sort of a more of a custom report.\nIntegrations\nJAMES\n15:01 \nWe build SQL queries directly to the database. And if it's just one or maybe two of these queries that you need, that could replace the need for headless. But if you need access to all of the data, the headless learn data solution would be better. But… you know, question out to the team.\nCustom Reports\nJAMES\n15:20 \nIs there any data that you are not able to get in through a P is or reporting or query builders at the moment?\nSAMANTHA\n15:29 \nI'd like to turn that question around to you first. Are there any fields that you feel would be beneficial? Having heard what Freddy and Jackie have said of what we are working towards, are there any data fields from the side that you, that we don't have access to, that you feel will be beneficial?\nIntegrations\nJAMES\n15:46 \nNo, I wouldn't say there's anything that we limit you getting through a P. I, it's just the ease of getting it by using something like learn data, the headless solution as opposed to having to create reports inside Docebo map the data, build the a P, I pull that into something like Salesforce that's the difference really, Sam.\nSAMANTHA\n16:09 \nYeah. I think so. I mean at the moment we're using CRM which is a… Tableau related tool or the driven tool for the visualization for the report building. And I think that, you know, is powerful enough right now to, you know, to build the recipes and coordinate all the different data sets that we have to pull together.\nIntegrations ends\nSAMANTHA\n16:33 \nOkay? So, you know, in terms of, you know, I would be interested in this if the, he said to us, listen, there are these six fields that would, you know, absolutely change your world if we gave you access to these six fields from a learning perspective, learning data perspective. You know, that would be a different story. But for me, I think that we've you know, we've looked that which components are available through to ever, and how would we use them, and what would we need to link to either create clear causality or at least a correlation between data sets between the learning and the impact of that learning in the field?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Freddy and Jackie discussed analyzing user data, such as start date, time to first deal, ramp up time, sales cycle and close rate; this data will be connected through a unique identifier.\n• James suggested tracking additional objectives outside of revenue to build a wider picture, such as employee happiness or average contract values.\n• Samantha pointed out that the current CRM tool is powerful enough for the team's needs. END"}
{"prompt":"SAMANTHA\n17:17 \nYou know? So we know that with learning, it's a little bit more loose in terms of it's more correlation than it is causality in most cases. And I think that, you know, if you guys are generating the data for us, then we already have a solution through C, RM a to pull that information in from HR records and whatever else.\nFREDDY\n17:43 \nI'm sharing it right now. I don't know if that helps visualizing what we've got because another thing that you mentioned a data warehouse requirements where like a MIddleware… which we don't need here. We've got all these data input that are synced. And the main issue that we had at the time was to identify that who ID at the bottom.\nCertifications\nFREDDY\n18:07 \nI keep coming back to it but that was really a blocker. I think we've fixed it. We did some tests and we, you know, but, you know, we've got cost enrollment. Okay. We got different version of the same like we got the change events. But the main one is the enrollment seeing the history and the change.\nLearning Plans\nFREDDY\n18:22 \nBut then you got a replication on actual cost then total user, then learning plan, cost, learning plan, enrollment session and set and attendance. So as long as we can interconnect all these data between each other. And I see they all seem to have like a record idea which I'm hoping that we'll be able to find in other elements.\nIntegrations\nFREDDY\n18:45 \nSo if we need to join one with the other, we will have the key to do that. But we want to be sure that we can join any of these ones and build a recipe inside CRM a, which is essentially a data staging manipulating stage where we can group different data set not only from the car but also from Salesforce. The user data point will give us all the start date, the region, the hierarchy, who's managing that particular person to then leverage that into a visualization. Again in CRM a. So… you know, I'm hearing there is a MIddleware potentially requirements which seems to be a bit more and adding an extra step compared to what we've got now. But yeah, until we know there is something missing and we have this issue with who I did, but that's not the case anymore. I don't think then, and if we can incorporate all these data point into one query, like you mentioned a query. But essentially, when you build up a recipe, you essentially building up your query, you decide, okay, which one of those fields do I want in out? I can, you know, build additional logic on to it… which would could also be part of a query. But we're building that up into Salesforce as part of a recipe. So yeah, I think I have a good understanding of where we can get from that already, what we can leverage out of this and what would be the limitation if any?\nJACKY\n20:17 \nQuestion. I do not know whether to Freddy to James just came in my mind what is, if we want, in any case, we would like also to see for example, how many tries a learner needed to go through a certification. So I assume having heard what you said, James, that we also have access to this raw data is not using the learn data, right? Or did I misunderstand something? So this data is, are also available in the current solution we are talking?\nCustom Reports\nJAMES\n20:46 \nThat's right? That's right? And having a look at Freddy, what you're showing us on the screen here, you know, without going through with a fine tooth comb, I would be of the assumption that you already have access to all of the data fields that you need to create the visualizations inside Salesforce or wherever you want to have those visualizations, whether they are here or not.\nCustom Reports ends\nJAMES\n21:11 \nI think what we would, you know, maybe we could come in and help later on down the line with learned data is if you're perhaps not getting everything that you need here. However, you know, from the conversation we're having, I would say that actually you are getting all the fields necessary and perhaps learn data isn't necessary for you at least for now. In the projects that you have going on.\nIntegrations\nFREDDY\n21:34 \nI think we'll get a lot of value out of maybe collaborating in understanding the data and the data scheme once we know, because you know, what, you know, what does that refer to into another data set? Because there should be connection between one set of data and another so that we can merge them together.\nIntegrations ends\nFREDDY\n21:53 \nSo that's where we would get a supposed value. And ultimately, as we go through our requirement need, in terms of analysis, there might be a case where we'll fall into that. And then we can maybe have the discussion and say, okay, that could be fixed by that other solution. But until we are at that point, I think we need to make progress on where we currently have.\nJAMES\n22:15 \nAnd Freddy, I think I might have a document that will help you, it's our data dictionary. So let me get access to the document, that is our data dictionary, and then send that over to you and that may just help out a little bit. You know, what is the, what is the name of the column in the table? What is the data type? And then a description, there is a description for everything. But there's a description for a lot of things within our tables that might just put you a step into the right direction. Again in terms of the mapping and the data sets that you have access to in front of us here.\nFREDDY\n22:47 \nYeah, that would be helpful.\nJAMES\n22:50 \nGreat. I'll definitely send that through to you. Okay? So.\nMICHAEL\n22:57 \nI just want to add something, you know, Freddy, it's been great to see this and you've been working hard. I think very much, you know, us adding these new sort of products or, you know, kind of elements to Docebo, it's for companies who don't have a Freddy, right?\nIntegrations\nMICHAEL\n23:14 \nSo you've done a huge amount of work here, kind of mapping all this. Our headless solution is for kind of companies that haven't you know, spent the time and kind of figured out how to, you know, kind of pull all this data together. So, I think, you know, it's become clear to me, you've probably already gone, you know, beyond what a company would get through, learn data, you know, potentially.\nIntegrations ends\nJACKY\n23:38 \nCall him the brain, you know, he's the brain.\nFREDDY\n23:42 \nHave great support. It's not.\nMICHAEL\n23:45 \nBut I'm again kinda thinking, you know, we've all come together today because there's obviously still a need and, you know, a need to look at something around data. So, I'm still kind of, you know, how do we pinpoint what's missing or what do we need to do to help you a bit further?\nIntegrations\nFREDDY\n24:04 \nI think we've only scratched the surface. We had an attempt last year. I remember to try and pull something out of these data set. And we were hitting this issue off because we've got some reports already live in Salesforce that we're leveraging those data points and we were seeing large discrepancy between what was on Salesforce versus what was directly pulled out on the table.\nIntegrations ends\nFREDDY\n24:24 \nA very high level completion in progress and… signed up or, you know, something like that. So there was a big question mark over that, who ID. And that was the main issue we had at the time and for some reason it wasn't updating or I don't know what was the technical issue in the background? But we worked together and we got to the point where we could get that status by user in line. But that's all we, we've got time for and then Christmas was upon us and we haven't done anything since. So that was the see that's the extent of my recipe. I'm not sharing my screen but, you know, it's just a couple of steps just to see, okay cost enrollment course table and join them together using whatever use, using the record ID which was a common identifier between the two. And then pull out whatever data we can get out of this joint and see those align with what we've got on the table.\nIntegrations\nFREDDY\n25:21 \nAnd we got to the point of further after several integration to say, okay, now we are matching. So we have a solid base but we need to, I mean that's that was just scratching the surface just identifying, do we have the connector between the data set of the table and our user data set, which is native of Salesforce. I'm not too sure how the data kind of interchange because it starts in Salesforce. So there must be some sort of feed on to the table to kind of communicate what is the ID of it seems to work? Then we need to further deep dive into it and start putting out the insight we need and fall into, you know, fail in case we fail, then start to rethink are we hitting system limitation or is it just something that I don't know from that? Maybe the dictionary will help identify?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Freddy plans to collaborate further with James on understanding the data scheme and mapping other data sets together. \n END"}
{"prompt":"JACKY\n26:15 \nAnd Michael, it would be also good for us to know and gives us a little bit secure when you mentioned what was happening last year, Freddy, and I think, yeah, I am not sure if they found out then that Docebo side was not for whatever reason updated. And your hottest confirmed that, you know, I'm hopefully correct with that. So, so… my question is, I mean, I really rely on Docebo. I would not never have the idea to call you and say, hey, is your system updating? Hopefully? So it would be super important for us if something for whatever reason happening at Docebo side that we get an information because obviously, that was what I remember from the desktop is… from your hot desk discussion or with your help test discussion. I said, okay, it was not updating since October and I saw serious, it was not updating since October. Perhaps you can help us in this way because you ask where we need support that we really need to be informed about things like that. And the same, the thing, it's a different story not our topic today. But if in Docebo is something under maintenance, we need to know that once I remember last year, I had the task to roll out a program, a big global program and the day was Docebo ante, maintenance, right? So that's super important meaning on a week if you know it for sure. But I assume that Docebo is not doing maintenance things from one minute to the other. So we need an information.\nMICHAEL\n27:48 \nAbsolutely. So let me try and find out why, you know, we certainly have a process for informing so, you know, I…\nJACKY\n27:57 \nWe never get any information because I'm on a fine. We never got any information over a year from the CEO about whatever crash of system? No updating?\nMICHAEL\n28:08 \nWhat, you know, do you have an idea of our sort of, you know, maintenance protocol in terms of informing customers in.\nEMER\n28:17 \nYeah.\nMICHAEL\n28:17 \nJames…\nEMER\n28:19 \nIs…\nJAMES\n28:19 \nOn the chat, the status page, I don't know if you've ever been a status dot co dot com?\nEMER\n28:26 \nAnyway, we could be emailed because I understand all these are fine. But then you have to go into the state like for example.\nJAMES\n28:32 \nIf you subscribe email, there's a button top right hand corner on the status page. And if you subscribe there, you should get email.\nEMER\n28:39 \nYou see this is the stuff we don't know. So what I'm looking for is Emer, we're going to be doing this tomorrow. So run all your reports today. And it's almost that it doesn't go into spam or it's not see if you get it from do help. It might even go into our spam or be blocked by it. So it needs to be, well, I, you know, so if you can, where do you subscribe? I see subscribe here. Yeah, I've never like, I would never go into something like this and then I have it on my head. Okay? We're going to run the reports on Monday because they need to be delivered for example, by Wednesday and then we find out the roadblocks but it's too late perhaps.\nJACKY\n29:17 \nCan for sure we can, that also discuss offline. But because we have a little bit with you what our here was, Michael. So my question to you, Michael would be, can you help Emer eventually to give her advice? Where we have to subscribe to get any information that we need?\nNotifications\nJACKY\n29:36 \nBecause again, I was my email address in over one year. So, so I got emails from you both but never from any, whatever it is. And that would be very helpful if we know that or it can be done from your side. I don't know, but we need to be informed at any case about all.\nJAMES\n29:54 \nHi.\nSAMANTHA\n29:55 \nJames, are you saying that if we subscribe that the emails will be sent?\nJAMES\n30:00 \nThat is, that is correct. So let me…\nJACKY\n30:03 \nAn…\nJAMES\n30:03 \nUnderstanding here. So the status Docebo dot com would be maintenance outages, anything very sort of serious and very critical. And by the way, it's not common that these emails go out.\nNotifications ends\nJAMES\n30:16 \nWe did have one today because we have some maintenance happening today in the platform which I think we'll be coming to an end soon doesn't impact everybody, but it does impact some customers for background jobs, nothing for end learners… the next place that you can subscribe to. And I recommend this less for outages and more for what's coming next. Is the community page that I've added there. If you're logged in there's a funky dog with some glasses on. And underneath him, there's a subscribe button.\nEMER\n30:45 \nYeah.\nJAMES\n30:45 \nYeah. And then you can subscribe, and then you will get three or perhaps four emails per month with when we as Docebo post an update for what's live in your platform.\nPricing\nJAMES\n30:57 \nNow, what's coming to your sandbox, and then a mid month maintenance release. So they are the three ones that go out every month every now and again, if we have something else that's important in terms of an update that will go out there, but usually three times per month.\nPricing ends\nJAMES\n31:12 \nAnd finally, there is an area inside of your LMS. And let me see if I can get to yours very quickly to see I can, I, so what some of your details?\nJACKY\n31:22 \nWe also can do that offline not to bind Freddy and Sam's time too much because that's more admin work, which is an email and my responsibility. So we are really happy to have whenever you have the time the.\nEMER\n31:37 \nJames, can I, sorry, Jacky just connect with you? Sometimes it asks for a password, but we log in through SSO. So I don't have a disabled password. We go through SSO. So I'll just link up with you separately but how to get access and get these to our accounts?\nJACKY\n31:52 \nLet's do that offline… that my password does not work. So, so we have obviously on our side some technical points, but I think we can discuss that offline the, but only to that again coming to Michael, that would be great if we can.\nMICHAEL\n32:11 \nI…\nJACKY\n32:11 \nGet this information especially regarding, and that's what we are talking today mainly about thinking the datas that if for whatever reason, I have no idea, it's not updated on the site that we need to know. And again, I could not imagine that datas are not updated at your site beside a system crash or whatever. But I'm not expecting the things frequently.\nMICHAEL\n32:39 \nAbsolutely. So I will get back to you with that, but, you know, I believe James, you know, he has probably shared the right links.\nNotifications\nMICHAEL\n32:46 \nYeah, I will email this across to you. I'm also happy to get you subscriber. I can click on the subscribe button for everyone on the, on this call.\nJACKY\n32:54 \nPlease make click clock. But anyway, we will check all passwords offline.\nEMER\n32:59 \nI…\nJAMES\n33:00 \nJust to let you know, you wouldn't be able to subscribe anybody to any of those emails, they would have to be done directly.\nNotifications ends\nJAMES\n33:06 \nSo man and Jack, you'd have to go through. So the three links that I've pasted into the chat here are the three. And if you go to and subscribe that's something that you can do by, no, no password authentication, nothing like that. You should just be able to access all these pages without them.\nJACKY\n33:24 \nOkay. No. But however, again, it's a topic then for upland does not work for me. It's asking for passwords.\nEMER\n33:31 \nYeah. Yeah. I, our it system, you see where I have to log in V, SSO, and then you have to log into the general. So I'll work on it for Jackie as well. It's just our own it system. It's not disable on this end. Okay?\nNext Steps\nJACKY\n33:46 \nOkay. And for those things, Freddy or Sam, what we have to think about regarding our next steps and where we might need Shape support now to go in the right direction, thinking… the data transfer.\nSAMANTHA\n34:04 \nAwesome. Thanks, Jackie. Just Michael, if you could get back to me as to whether the 20 eighth will work for you, we also have the 20 ninth available, but I preferably like to have all three of our platform partners on the same day.\nWrap-Up\nMICHAEL\n34:18 \nAll right. 20 eighth would be better for me. I just need to get my boss to just confirm, so I will get back to you as soon as possible with that confirmation.\nSAMANTHA\n34:26 \nExcellent. Thanks, Michael. Thanks James.\nMICHAEL\n34:28 \nThanks. Thanks, Sam.\nJACKY\n34:30 \nOkay.

As soon as we got back, she got sniffles, she got some cold and wife started crying like she just has cold don't cry like now or happen on like or whatever.\nJEREMIAH\n9:04 \nYeah, second.\nMANOJ\n9:05 \nOne, she was out like next day, she came out, let's go.\nJEREMIAH\n9:12 \nI…\nMANOJ\n9:12 \nGo and see something happen. Really. Yeah, shall be fine. No worries.\nJEREMIAH\n9:16 \nHow funny. Yeah, I remember those years for sure. Just like hell after parenting like nobody's business, just trying to be as careful as possible but yeah, that's a really good thing to share. I appreciate that.\nSmall Talk ends\nMANOJ\n9:27 \nYep. Yes, absolutely. All right, Jim. So here's the deal and I'm working on closing this thing out now. You know, we have a couple of vendors that we're looking for, but I'm really hoping that I can get this closed by end of February if not then at least early March.\nOnboarding\nMANOJ\n9:45 \nWe want to get this project started. I know SAML is really excited to start working with the MS and MS and things. I have. I mean, I know we haven't signed the nda so we haven't received those documents for software and all that. But it gives me a comfort that, you know, you guys have it, you know, so I have an it back. I'm mainly an it guy. So I look out for those things. But the other thing that I'm getting some pushback on is the pricing that's one thing I wanted to discuss with you and I know I have the pricing that you sent across to Carmel with me. I'm going to lay this out here.\nPricing\nMANOJ\n10:29 \nWe are at some point definitely going to be at 500 and above user count, considering that we want to build this for internal users as well as our customers, right? So the customers, when we start bringing the customers on board with the system that's where the count is probably going to start increasing, but we don't want to start with that count right now. So we would probably start with 300 and then as the time comes will increase our town to 500 or, you know, I don't know from 300, we can go to 354 and so on and so forth. But the pricing is one thing as I said is something that is really having a push back from the finance team on our end. What can you work with? What are the options that you can work with? Let me ask you that first.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n11:24 \nYeah. Let me I…\nMANOJ\n11:25 \nThink.\nJEREMIAH\n11:26 \nDefinitely. And I'm a visual person too. So I'm looking at this, I'm sure that you have this on your side. So maybe we can just look at this together as I'm you know, envisioning your use case, how you're going to market, you know, focusing specifically on onboarding, making sure that we can, you know, drive success and all the different facets of your technological stack or the software you offer has many different products within it.\nCoach & Share\nJEREMIAH\n11:50 \nSo my thought at least my recommendation was the discover coach and share. I'm curious as you look on your side is, are we on the same page with trying to include the discover coach and share or just the LMS by itself?\nMANOJ\n12:02 \nNo, we are looking at by…\nJEREMIAH\n12:04 \nNo, that's by itself. Okay.\nCoach & Share ends\nMANOJ\n12:06 \nAnd, and let's have this conversation based on that. For now, I will go back to SAML and see if she wants that thing. And then we can have a different conversation if need be. But right now we are looking at LMS by.\nJEREMIAH\n12:18 \nOkay. That's fine. So essentially what I've done and this is what we have is like a package price to offer for the LMS.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n12:27 \nAnd then as far as accounts from like the account executive level, I can get up to about like 19 and a quarter. So I've applied that here. So you'll do if you did like quick math, you'd see that this is almost like 20 percent discounted. So I would pose the same question to you. Truthfully, where do we need to be? Because this goes kind of above and beyond. I bring leadership into the conversation. We talk about the timeline, why we wanna go below 20,000. This is typically our threshold that we like to stay at. Okay? But yeah, what are your?\nPricing ends\nMANOJ\n13:01 \nHonestly? Yeah. Honestly, Jeremiah didn't come prepared with that answer of where we want to be. I thought I will talk to you first and see what's the best case scenario that we can do on this. I know if there's a score for something on the one time charge, if that can be looked into pricing price, we already talked.\nPricing\nMANOJ\n13:21 \nAnd the second, and the third thing that I want to bring up is as I said, you know, we are going to be about at least for 500 or above at some point in time. I just don't know when that is. I'm guessing that will happen when we start bringing our customers on board. So whatever price we decide for the 300 we want. So we are starting with 300, but we want to utilize the pricing for 500. Does that make sense?\nJEREMIAH\n13:53 \nYeah. So essentially, the pricing I'm sharing with you right now based on the incentive, we may sign up to 300 today, but months down the road or in the future here, we may also want to scale up to the 500 and you don't want to lose out on the incentive pricing. Is that correct?\nMANOJ\n14:09 \nFor the 500? Yeah. So basically get the 500 pricing start with 300 licenses. And that way when we're adding more, we still continue with the 500 incentive.\nJEREMIAH\n14:18 \nSure. So I can, we can look at this in two different ways. We could start as in I actually quote you and we agree on the 300 monthly active user agreement. This would be, you know, the pricing of it. As of today, we bring some leadership. We'll have that conversation to look at this a little bit further. Our thought I guess essentially would be if we wanted to do, if we wanted to go to 500, it's just a simple addendum you pay the difference. If I, you know, if you go six months and you're only looking at six months of the year, the 500, you just pay the difference of the six months and not the full 12 months. We would simply like build in the endemto your contract. It wouldn't renew or extend your terms or anything like that. Would be option one. The second option would be we just quote you out and price you at the 500 monthly active user plan that you're only going to have 300 active users. We'd bring lead to talk about what the best pricing scenario would be to lower this to meet your requirements today and allow you to fill up having said that though it would be more expensive than the 300 Mau plan. So if the 300 a plan is getting pushed back on pricing, I would be concerned to lead with a 500 at a discounted price even more.\nMANOJ\n15:33 \nSo what I was getting, so definitely the 500 has more discounted. The pricing is much better, right? Compared to 300. So what I was thinking is, you know, apply the 500 pricing model, but we start with 300 users. So we pay for 300 users only. And then we keep paying as we add more users to it.\nJEREMIAH\n15:52 \nYeah.\nMANOJ\n15:53 \nWhat I'm saying?\nJEREMIAH\n15:54 \nYeah, I don't have a way to build that into our model. Like the pricing model is very specific. The tiers are very set kind of in stone. So I thought is like if you go over 300, it may be more lucrative for you to have an overage fee like a one time overage fee for that month instead of having to jump to the next tier.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n16:14 \nI have to pay the difference for the next tier and we don't really necessarily have it's. Not easy for us to do this on a large scale with customers because if we started these types of scenarios and we were watching each customer differently, it'd be very hard from an account management perspective to.\nMANOJ\n16:31 \nSo… why don't you see what we can work out here? Why don't you, I mean as it is, you'll need to go back and talk to the management and come back with some answers on this side. As I said, one thing is the pricing itself, how good and we can work with that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Manoj was looking for vendors for the project and wanted to finish by end of February or  early March. \n• Manoj wanted to learn more about the pricing of the LMS as well as the Discover Coach and Share program. \n• Jeremiah suggested a package price for the LMS.\n• Manoj asked Jeremiah to work out a pricing solution that starts with 300 users but allows them to increase up to 500 without losing incentive pricing. END"}
{"prompt":"Pricing\nMANOJ\n16:49 \nAnything we can look into the one time fee. And then this last requirement of, you know, we get the 500 pricing, but we start with 300 users for now.\nJEREMIAH\n17:01 \nAnd then could you, and this is just a, for instance, what would a timeline be as far as when you would like to implement customers or when do you think that Growth would occur naturally?\nPricing ends\nMANOJ\n17:16 \nReally difficult for me to say that what we're trying to do now, I mean, we had talked about a couple of different scenarios. One is since this is all a bit new to us in terms of, you know, the approach we're taking with our training and skill development and everything else. What we had talked about was making sure we deploy this internally, you know, get some hands on that, get some mastery on that, and then start introducing the customers to this. So that can be, you know, sometime this year or maybe towards the end of this year, I really don't want to say something and, you know.\nJEREMIAH\n17:56 \nYeah.\nMANOJ\n17:57 \nThis is, yeah, this is more hypothetical than when I was talking to our senior wife's, been of operations. He also had a taught where we had a couple of customers who probably would like to bring them on before that happens. So is going in both directions personally, me running this show and implementing this system with you guys. I would just target our internal first because I don't like to create a lot of, you know, I don't like to go in too many different directions at the same time. Unless I'm sure where we are going and how we're doing it. So let's assume and say like, okay, if we implement this thing successfully for our internal users this year, then maybe towards the end of the year, we can start introducing our customers into this.\nJEREMIAH\n18:45 \nOkay. And thank you for the hypothetical, what I'm attempting to do with the information you're sharing with me too as well as to build a use case to go to ship and say, and essentially, this is me kind of sharing with you like the process I have to go for bigger discounts.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n19:01 \nWe share the timeline. Essentially, I would be saying, hey look, this just wants to make a decision by the end of the month. They're coming and asking us for a best and final offer. They are putting emphasis or focused on the one time upfront cost. So year one as well as, you know, anything we can do with the yearly cost, looking at the MS only, they're I thought that we could increase users from 300 to 500 within the same year.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n19:28 \nSo there is potential that could happen. Obviously that potential could fail, but we're not saying anything wrong. So my thought then from there is to really just kinda pick at what we can guarantee, right? So as a business, you know, we're obviously on the sales side of the software, we wanna have a guaranteed arr predicted or committed for a certain time.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n19:49 \nSo if we can say by the end of the month, then that obviously gives me the best wiggle room and the shortest amount of time for them to make a decision and get something back to you for you to present to others and then go through paperwork audio good stuff, right?\nMANOJ\n20:00 \nAbsolutely.\nJEREMIAH\n20:01 \nYeah. So, I guess, you know, and I would love to know where you would want us to be. I mean, grand, whereas if we were sitting at 20 percent, now, the cool wiggle room we'll see is about five to 10 percent. If I said that, you know, and you had a hard box like yes or no, that would put us in a pretty hard predicument, but that's why I wanted to ask you like, you know, if there is a certain place where we need to be, let us know and we can kinda work from there. But we definitely to find a middle ground that's lucrative for both of us. That makes…\nPricing ends\nMANOJ\n20:29 \nAbsolutely. So, so my thought was to, you know, have this discussion with you first see what you can come back with and then sit down again with my finance and say, okay, now that Jeremiah has worked with me, if this is not acceptable, then we need to go back and give a number to him rather than saying we need more or anything, right?\nOnboarding\nMANOJ\n20:52 \nI mean, that makes sense for me. So that's I think that's I think let's do it that way. I can tell you like once you come back to me with what our other proposals based on our discussion, I'll take this to my finance and say, okay, this is what we've got, this is their best case. If we agree with this great, you know, we can start working doing the paperwork. If you guys still think that this is a more we're getting some pressure from, you know, CFO and, you know, potentially the board, then we need to know where we should ask them to be rather than just coming back to you and saying, yeah, it's still not working to something more, you know.\nOnboarding ends\nJEREMIAH\n21:32 \nSure. Sure. You know, we have our threshold. So we'll put that into play as well. And I mean, we never want to say the words, no, I like those like manage.\nMANOJ\n21:41 \nAbsolutely.\nJEREMIAH\n21:42 \nWe understand that, but we also are a product, this, that's going to be worth it. So we're excited, you know, to have the foundation, the transparency that you'll share with us to lay, you know, understanding of what you're trying to accomplish, how you want to measure that success, how we can work together and partner together and make it happen. So it really comes down to, you know, just driving those efficiencies measuring the KPI'S correctly, and then putting it all into play.\nMANOJ\n22:04 \nAbsolutely.\nJEREMIAH\n22:05 \nYeah. So let me get some support for sure on this. And like you said, I want to hit the ground running. We're already on this, you know, the 20 second on a short month.\nNext Steps\nMANOJ\n22:15 \nAnd yeah. So that was going to my next question as to when do you think you can get back to me on this? So we can just keep moving the ball.\nJEREMIAH\n22:25 \nYeah, I would hope by tomorrow as soon as we end the call, you're the last call I have on my books today.\nNext Steps ends\nJEREMIAH\n22:31 \nSo as soon as we wrap this conversation up, I'm gonna go ahead and everything together in an email. I submit a ticket in Salesforce on my end for this type of support and then they'll look at all of those qualities and pieces that we've put together in our proposal. I'll fill in some of the information and reasons as to why we need to look heavier into a discount. There isn't any other like a red flag I can think of as far as right now if anything is necessary or needed. Is it okay if I email you for it specifically?\nWrap-Up\nMANOJ\n23:00 \nYeah, yeah, absolutely.\nJEREMIAH\n23:01 \nThe records, I can like text as well, whatever is.\nMANOJ\n23:05 \nThat's fine. That's fine. I mean, I'm pretty much open with that. You have my cell phone in the, in my email signature. So that's not a problem at all. Feel free to do that. And yeah, I mean, I'm pretty much giving that same kind of timeline to others also that I need to have something tomorrow.\nOnboarding\nMANOJ\n23:23 \nI mean, just from a, that, you know, we can get the ball rolling pretty quick and coming that we are coming to a month and also keeping in mind the implementation time, right? Because that's about at least a two month implementation time. So that's the reason I, you know, I reach out to our CFO, I reach out to my boss with SVP for operations. I said if you guys have certain timelines in mind that you're talk to the boat and you better tell me because there's this implementation timeline here. You know, there's going to be at least two to three months of implementation required. So if we are not going to sign and close this thing really quick, then those timelines keeps shifting and I'm doing the same thing with the CMS system as well, just trying to get both of these things together because my part is, as we are working on implementation, semi can take the CMS part and start working on the content.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • A timeline was discussed for introducing customers to the new platform, with a focus on completing implementation for internal users by the end of the year and then beginning to introduce customers. \n• They will start with 300 users for now. \n• Middle ground was sought that is mutually beneficial, and it was agreed that Jeremiah would provide his threshold for discounts to Manoj. \n• It was discussed that implementation would take two to three months, during which time Manoj will also work on CMS content.

Well, there you go. Sorry. Remind me where did you go again?\nKRISTIN\n0:27 \nWe went to Miami, spent a week in there and then we wanted to try one of those virgin voyages that's kind of it's a little different.

But I will, you know, I was able to get a contract with another state agency who uses that for this one course that we're that's required by. All right?

So I'm taking working with Johnstone from Docebo end to help the Docebo connect, get up and running.

And what that API does is we have fields, we have one field associated with users where they can populate their neat ID. And then we have a field with courses where we can populate the course, Nate ID. And then if somebody with an ad ID takes an associated course with an ad ID than that through the API, transfers that information to Nate for tracking so that they can get their recertification credits. So it's much more Automatic for them and we don't have to submit any certificates or such. So I don't know if somebody from Nate wants to clarify that, but that's how I see it happening from our end.\nGURMINDER\n3:10 \nHi, Janet. I'm the only one here from me. No, that's exactly correct. It's very simple and how you described it… Jason from your research is, are we missing any steps?\nIntegrations\nJASON\n3:26 \nNo, I think that is essentially what's happening and what we want to try to keep that going so that that's the goal.\nHARSH\n3:38 \nI have a small question. So if I'm understanding this correctly, this would just be a data flow from Docebo to net, correct? And there is no data coming back from net to Docebo.\nIntegrations ends\nJASON\n3:52 \nThere would be like a status like status information coming back to let you know whether or not it was successfully… imported to our system.\nHARSH\n4:02 \nRight. And that will just be the payload response, right? Yes. Okay. So… so I mean, when I was saying that, you know, there's no data being sent back to, I mean, no, no put or no… update call is being made to endpoint, right?\nIntegrations\nJASON\n4:29 \nNot that I'm aware of that's right?\nHARSH\n4:33 \nSo, can anyone from team net, can someone show me the exposed API end points that we can leverage for this?\nJASON\n4:45 \nUSA has a document that we have showing some of the endpoints or the endpoints that are involved. And I also have a C sharp… solution that tests the endpoints to show… how it can be used. We don't have a postman collection. I would like to get that set up, but we don't have that currently… but we have a document to show you the payloads that are needed.\nHARSH\n5:23 \nThat will be great though a quick question. So I'm not sure if sharp as a, you know, body schema will be supported with Docebo or not because we mostly work with rest API services. And I guess in that case, we might… just give me a second.\nJASON\n5:46 \nYeah, and we can work on getting a postman collection to you. I just don't have one ready to go right right now.\nIntegrations ends\nHARSH\n5:55 \nNo worries. No worries. I mean, I just wanted to highlight that real quick that it might be a blocker moving forward. So, yeah… okay.\nJASON\n6:05 \nShe can't on mute. She's in the chat saying she will share the document.\nHARSH\n6:14 \nPerfect. If anyone can, you know, share the, you know, share the once the document is being shared, if someone can pull it up on screen and we can just probably talk about the kind of data format that is being expected by Nate, you know, that for example, if you're passing on some enrollment completions or some core ID'S or core dates, what kind of data format are you looking at?\nJASON\n6:44 \nYeah. So it should just be a Jason object with, I think there's like… maybe 10 fields including Nate ID, first and last name, email, the at course ID… completion date and training hours. I'm not sure what other ones there are, but… let's see.\nHARSH\n7:14 \nAnd for all the data points that, you know, you mentioned, Jason question, Janet, or Judi, where do you folks plan to host these data points into? Would that be cardinal fields or have you thought of something else?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Janet described the use case they are trying to implement, which involves users populating their NEAT ID in one field and courses being populated with a NEAT ID in another field, so that information can be transferred to NEAT for recertification credits. \n• Harsh asked if there was any data flow from Docebo back to NEAT, which was confirmed there was not. \n• Jason provided a document of exposed API endpoints that could be leveraged as well as a C sharp solution showing how the endpoints can be used and he discussed payloads needed for the integration. \n• Harsh clarified that a POSTMAN collection would also be necessary and inquired about where data points such as Nate ID, first/last name, email, course ID, completion date, and training hours will be hosted (i.e. cardinal fields). END"}
{"prompt":"JANET\n7:27 \nSo, there will be one course additional field with the ad ID for those courses that have it. And there will be a user additional field that has the user net ID.\nHARSH\n7:42 \nOkay. And…\nHARSH\n7:51 \nAnd it's safe to assume that one Nate ID would only be the net course ID. When I say Nate ID, I'm talking about the course level course additional field. One net ID would be just unique to one course in Docebo, or they can be. So two Nate ID'S or one Nate ID can be linked to five different courses.\nJANET\n8:18 \nNo, they're all unique.\nHARSH\n8:19 \nOkay. The unique, so technically, Nate ID'S are representing certificate templates in Nate, right?\nGURMINDER\n8:29 \nAnd ID is a unique identifier for an individual that has a certification in our system.\nHARSH\n8:37 \nOkay. So my bad, Janet, could you repeat the name of the variable you'll be storing on cost additional field?\nJANET\n8:46 \nLet me see if I can find what we actually call it. But so there we have… so gender we have both a Nate ID for the user and a Nate ID for the course that's been approved. So Harsh is asking about the one for the course.\nGURMINDER\n9:07 \nOkay.\nJANET\n9:07 \nI'll look up and see if we call them different things right now in.\nJASON\n9:12 \nIn the API, it's called Nate ID for the individual person and Nate course ID for the training.\nJASON\n9:29 \nAnd Susan did email that document to the group here. So she.\nHARSH\n9:34 \nYep. Got it.\nHARSH\n9:42 \nOkay. This looks relatively… straightforward. We wouldn't have to do.\nHARSH\n9:54 \nYeah.\nJASON\n9:54 \nSo, as far as far as actually importing the trainings you use that first standpoint. And then the ones that are in the two dot one section is the actual import. And then the two dot two section is to see the results of that.\nHARSH\n10:07 \nShare my screen for a second… because I'll need some guidance to go through this real quick. So you mentioned that this is the… this right here, is this for input?\nJASON\n10:23 \nCorrect. That is our production endpoint. And the second one is for our staging system. Yep.\nHARSH\n10:34 \nSo, this is where you want me to. This is where you want to connect to deliver the data, right? If you're testing on staging, right?\nJASON\n10:43 \nCorrect.\nHARSH\n10:45 \nAnd this is the kind of input that is required from us.\nJASON\n10:48 \nYes. And I'm not sure if this document details. I can, I need to do a little bit of investigation but there is some authentication that needs to happen before this endpoint can be called. We have a fair token authentication scheme that we would need to set up an account for you that has the training import role and you can use that you basically call one endpoint to get authenticated. And then you can use that token to… make this call with.\nHARSH\n11:26 \nHi, this is perfect. This is exactly my next question because the connector that we'll be using to set up connect, we would be requiring an authentication method. So I guess a JWT or a broken would work for us.\nJASON\n11:41 \nI will get you the details of that exact stuff, but that's the expectation.\nHARSH\n11:47 \nOkay. Okay. So net ID required something. And Janet, while I'm going through the data points, please keep me honest and, you know, just stop me right there. And then if you think that I'm going down the wrong line. So, net ID is something that is available to us on the course level on the course additional.\nJANET\n12:05 \nThat's the user.\nHARSH\n12:07 \nThat's the user. Okay? My bad. So user ID is something that is available on the user additional field. We can pick this up. We have good her user last name can be picked, first name, pigged, email picked. And this is the core ID which is available on the course level. Correct? Yes. Okay. Can be picked eight core version. Okay. Talk to me about this. What is this?\nJASON\n12:32 \nWe'll have to go look. I'm not aware.\nJANET\n12:37 \nI don't think we track that. So it's usually empty.\nJASON\n12:41 \nYeah. So that is there for the endpoint but it's not actively being used. It's what it sounds like.\nHARSH\n12:51 \nOkay, perfect. So the next piece is training title. And Janet, if I'm correct training title would correspond to the course name in Docebo.\nCertifications\nHARSH\n12:59 \nRight? Yes. Okay. Perfect. I can be picked training status. Okay? So there is no flag in do that talks about that if it's a mandatory course or not a mandatory course.\nJANET\n13:13 \nI don't think it's about mandatory. It's the completion status.\nHARSH\n13:17 \nMy bad, sorry, the transcript status, my bad. Okay. So we can do that enrollment level can be picked date can be picked tier training hours. Okay? So, is this something that talks about for how long that goes generally last?\nJANET\n13:40 \nI don't know if that's the estimated time of the course or the times the user spent in the course?\nHARSH\n13:50 \nBecause it's technically not possible to track, it is possible, but it is, I would suggest not using the time that users spent on the course because it can be skewed very easily. So, if I leave the course on and, you know, keep hovering the mouse over it for probably three to four hours, the course time is definitely skewed.\nCertifications ends\nJUDI\n14:16 \nHarsh. I think when we first set this up, that was… the seat time that was designated at the course level. So if it's a 30 minute course or an hour long course that's the time that we would use.\nHARSH\n14:33 \nPerfect. That is doable. We should be good here. That is doable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Janet and Harsh discussed a user's and course additional field with the user net ID and course ad ID.\n• Nate ID’s represent certification templates in Nate, unique to each course in Docebo.\n• Jason shared an API endpoint for production and staging system authentications via JWT or broken token.\n• Required parameters include user details (last name, first name, email), core ID, training title, transcript status, enrollment level date, tier training hours.\n• Training hours are designated at the course level (30 min/1 hour duration).

{"prompt":"HARSH\n14:38 \nSo… so we don't need to get anything from… doesn't need. Yeah, we don't need to get anything from Nate server. So we should be good here.\nJASON\n14:58 \nJust for completion sake, the email address that is sent in for that call, assuming it's a successful import… the, an email message will be sent to that address saying that the, you have been credited with hours for your course.\nNotifications ends\nHARSH\n15:21 \nSo, you're talking about this site?\nJASON\n15:26 \nBelieve so because when I'm looking at the content of that message, it looks like it's… it. I'll paste it into the chat here.\nJASON\n15:51 \nHey.\nJUDI\n15:51 \nJason is my understanding of that was coming from your end, not from our university.\nJASON\n15:58 \nCorrect. Yeah, that's our system. Okay. Sorry, this is HTML.\nMIKE\n16:03 \nIgnore all the…\nJANET\n16:04 \nWe…\nJUDI\n16:05 \nNeed to send it out. No, okay.\nHARSH\n16:19 \nOkay. So.\nJANET\n16:23 \nLooks pretty straightforward.\nJUDI\n16:34 \nI guess for Harsh benefit on that part there, that message that goes to the users email is not something that he needs to worry about that.\nJASON\n16:46 \nThat was more for the group here. That's kind of the I'm trying to get a better understanding of the overall process myself. So… sharing.\nHARSH\n17:00 \nSo, Jason, we're talking about this. Let me say perfect. So third point is where I can think about the authentication.\nJASON\n17:06 \nYep. And we will need to set you up with a user that has the proper role to complete that call.\nHARSH\n17:15 \nSo, that's something I would like to talk about after we have, you know, completed the whole… this thing, what this review process. I really want to point out the responsibilities of moving forward with this one. And I guess if not sure, you… know how to configure the recipes and how to move forward with the whole piece. But yeah, before that quick question on this one, when you say invalid Nate ID… how in what cases can a Nate ID be invalid?\nJASON\n17:56 \nI mean, it's basically, I don't remember how many digits it's eight eight or so digits of numbers. And so, if you pass in one that does not map to a valid user account, that could get sent back.\nHARSH\n18:13 \nOkay. And…\nJANET\n18:14 \nThe user enters their ID incorrectly perhaps is.\nJASON\n18:20 \nYeah, that seems like a likely cause of that, or if they put in the wrong ID for their, for them, like if they put in somebody else's ID and you get that second, that last name combination here.\nJANET\n18:36 \nOkay.\nHARSH\n18:39 \nOkay. So this is something that would be super important because I see the highest risk that I'm seeing with this recipe building is this piece… high chances, for example, if on nets database, if my Nate ID is stored with the surname or the last name, Barton and I've typed something wrong in to this whole thing would fall?\nJASON\n19:03 \nOkay. Or if somebody's last name changes and they didn't update their account and they…\nHARSH\n19:08 \nExactly. Don't…\nJASON\n19:08 \nKnow what's going on? Yeah.\nHARSH\n19:12 \nSo, so we need to make sure we kinda need to make sure that the net ID that the users are entering on the system and the last name that we are entering for the users into matches the last name for… from the database of Nate, that will be super important.\nCertifications\nJUDI\n19:33 \nHey, Janet, question on all of these, the error messages. We don't how do we get involved at this point when there are error messages or do we?\nJANET\n19:45 \nI don't know that we have.\nJANET\n19:51 \nBlyth would be the better one to ask and she is out right now. But usually what happens if a user knows that they took a Nate course and they go look at their recertification credits, they know if they didn't get the credit that they needed and they will contact us.\nCertifications ends\nJANET\n20:14 \nAnd then blite usually reaches out to somebody at net to check on that. And usually it gets resolved that way. At that point. I think it's manually resolved like if somebody changed their last name, but they didn't update it either in the LMS or with Nate, then that could be that, that's something that Nate resolves for them.\nCertifications\nJANET\n20:41 \nAnd they might have to, for that instance, they might have to… get a PDF copy of their completion certificate and give it to Nate to prove that they did it. So then in that case, that's not Automatic… and that's just something we handle one off with.\nJUDI\n21:01 \nSo we don't get a report.\nCertifications ends\nJANET\n21:04 \nI am aware of.\nJUDI\n21:05 \nError messages that say here are the things that were transmitted that there were errors for. So all of that just stays with Nate. And then if the user raises a question, then we can get involved and help resolve it. But there's no, I guess my point is to Harsh. I don't believe there's anything that's passed back to our current university in any form at all that has those error messages that's just live at Nate.\nJANET\n21:37 \nSo, maybe Jason, could you answer what happens when an error pops up? Like who gets the error message? Who knows?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Harsh and the group need to ensure that the user's Nate ID and last name match those in Nate's database, as an incorrect entry could lead to errors. \n• If an error does occur, it is usually manually resolved by contact with Nate; no report of these errors is provided to the university. END"}
{"prompt":"JASON\n21:45 \nThe, whoever is calling the endpoint on the API. Like basically you say I want to import and here's all the data relating to that training. And then that comes into the Nate system, we process it, we encounter an error and we will send back a result, a response to that, like saying you got the wrong last name? Well, well… the response will contain that information. It sounds like in the current system that nothing is being done with that response perhaps. But… basically the import didn't succeed. So there's nothing that's happened on the Nate side other than, hey, you tried to import it and it didn't work.\nJANET\n22:33 \nSo, blue volt is currently getting those error messages. We're never hearing about them. What I understand.\nJASON\n22:40 \nYeah, that's like we don't have any visibility on it, but that seems likely, okay.\nHARSH\n22:46 \nAnd with connect, we can actually keep track of the error log. So we can actually do some error handling on our end. And if we get some errors, as Jason mentioned that if we get a response from Nate saying the last match and the it doesn't match, that's something that we can, you know, leverage or look at in the connect environment.\nJASON\n23:09 \nSo in this document, if you go back up to the two two section, I think that… the results for the imports might be what would be useful. This might not be getting used right now, but basically… they get results at the bottom page two.\nHARSH\n23:31 \nSo at the bottom…\nJASON\n23:33 \nThe results gives you the results of the imports that have happened. And so you basically will say give me the results.\nCustom Reports\nJASON\n23:40 \nAnd if you scroll down to page three, it shows you like for each one. Like for this person here's, the course that was trying to be attempted. And here's the error that we've got. So that is, could be used to generate a report. That… would be something that would be useful if there's like… any… frequent errors that are happening or if you just want to be able to… use that… to see what's going on.\nCustom Reports ends\nJASON\n24:13 \nBut… to the point before, if there's a failed import, it doesn't like it's not going to trigger anything. There has to be some system that like a system called to this endpoint or like you said, the candidate themselves realizing that their… training hasn't happened until then they call in, but… it would be good to be more proactive on that.\nIntegrations\nJANET\n24:49 \nSo Harsh, does that make sense to you? So we haven't been getting this data, but it sounds like we can get it through connect and then my team would be able to do something with it.\nHARSH\n25:01 \nYeah. I have a quick question for Jason. So Jason, let's say that I pass a payload for as expected in section two point one point, if I pass the payload which has all the information and somehow I'll get an error.\nIntegrations ends\nHARSH\n25:18 \nSo will the response. So let's say if I get 400 from your API endpoint, so will that error payload contain any error? Any information related to this? Or let's say this?\nJASON\n25:34 \nI believe. So it's been like, I have not been in that recently. But I believe the pay response to that request will contain the error message. So.\nHARSH\n25:45 \nSo, to answer Janet question again, Janet, we can actually utilize this till the time we're getting the payload error response from Nate. Okay? So we can do some error handling on our end and the error handling would be able to give you the output where you can say this is the issue, so you can hammer it out. You can figure that out.\nNotifications\nJANET\n26:09 \nOkay. That would be great.\nHARSH\n26:14 \nAnd you can also receive an email. So let's say if a payload fails and you get an error at that point of time, you can actually set the error handling to send out a message to a particular email saying, okay, this particular job did not succeed and this is the error payload and this is the payload that was sent.\nNotifications ends\nHARSH\n26:32 \nSo you can actually have a, you know, a set email or a fake like an email just to handle the error errors from this recipe.\nJANET\n26:41 \nWe have our help desk email address that we could use for.\nHARSH\n26:46 \nPerfect. Okay. So I really want to talk about the completion date. So, Jason, would you say that this is the exact kind of format you would want the date?\nHARSH\n27:01 \nBecause doc will deliver something in this form. Let me send this to you.\nJASON\n27:05 \nI will have to investigate on that. I'm not sure of the exact date format that is expected. So I will… reply. I'll get back to you on that as far as the date format that we support.\nCertifications\nHARSH\n27:25 \nOkay.\nJUDI\n27:27 \nYeah, Harsh, I think the date format that you just put in the chat there, I believe that's the date format that comes out in the data that we typically see in our course enrollment totals, reports and everything. So I would be surprised if that's not what's transmitted today.\nHARSH\n27:47 \nThat's so, I mean, this is exactly what comes out of your enrollment statuses. And this is what is being transmitted to any other system.\nJUDI\n27:57 \nOkay. So, yeah.\nJANET\n27:58 \nOurs is actually month day and then year. So it's a little bit different.\nJUDI\n28:04 \nActually, you're right? Sorry, I just realized that.\nCertifications ends\nHARSH\n28:10 \nI mean, again, there's something that can be played around with connect. We can change date for match, but I wanted to make sure that, you know, this, we're on the same page. We can actually play around, but there is something that I had a quick question on… course numbers supplied multiple courses. We, yeah, this won't be possible because we have unique course codes.\nHARSH\n28:35 \nAnd verifying. Okay. So when can this happen? What you verify?\nJASON\n28:44 \nYeah, I'll have to go investigate that.\nJASON\n28:53 \nI do not have an answer at this point.\nHARSH\n28:55 \nI mean take it and just let me know. I just wanna make sure that this… like these errors just to make sure that if we want to set up some error handling for this, do we have an option or not… perfect? So I guess we got here, this is how we can then ticket we can use the JWT?\nJASON\n29:20 \nI wanna say that specific error message is if we encounter an exception that isn't one that we know how to handle. So it's kind of like an unknown catch all message.\nGURMINDER\n29:33 \nOkay, perfect.\nHARSH\n29:34 \nAnd I got to see the completion date format. So it's your month date, the time and the micro seconds to some level and the time zone. So we can actually play around with this. Yeah, we should be able to get this.\nHARSH\n29:53 \nOkay. Anything else that is here? Let me look at this. Yeah, I don't see any red flags. I think we should be able to get this up and running… with a few caveats around the other handling piece. I think, so we should be good. If anyone else has some questions. I mean, I'm personally okay with this, but if anyone has some questions more than happy to answer.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Blue Volt is currently not receiving error responses regarding imports into the Nate system.\n• The completion date format needs further investigation by Jason.\n• Error handling including JWT usage will be required for any other caveats.

{"prompt":"JUDI\n30:24 \nSo just so that I understand it looks like the existing API as it's set up right now is gonna be able to work, okay, Harsh with Docebo. So without additional coding and significant changes to that.\nHARSH\n30:42 \nI'm not sure if the cap, the chap code would be able to work with us.\nIntegrations\nHARSH\n30:49 \nBut as Jason mentioned that they would be more than happy to work around with the rest services, I don't think so. There's any more custom development required? We should be able to leverage this endpoint and get this piece moving.\nJUDI\n31:04 \nOkay. And Jason, then on the rest API, you'd mentioned that you would be able to kinda translate this using postman would be involved with that.\nIntegrations ends\nMIKE\n31:19 \nIt…\nJASON\n31:20 \nWould just basically like when I was mentioned in the C sharp setup, that is basically just a test harness to like exercise the endpoints in our staging environment. And I would basically want to set up the equivalent within postman basically saying, all right, you make this request to log in and get your bearer token, then you make this request to import the training and get make like basically… use postman as a tool for… exercising it so that you then know like exactly what payloads… like.\nIntegrations\nJASON\n31:58 \nIf you encounter a problem in the Docebo system, you can try to replicate it and post man and more easily see what's going on. So.\nJUDI\n32:10 \nWhat, what would be involved in doing that both in terms of your time and how long it would take to make that happen to align with Harsh and the rest of our projects?\nIntegrations ends\nJASON\n32:25 \nIf everything fingers crossed, if everything works as expected, it shouldn't be more than like a couple of hours. But depending on, I mean that's best case. So I would wanna do that, like to basically use that to prove out proof our system and then basically provide that to Harsh to say, all right here's another way to access our endpoints in a way that's been tested on our side as well. So.\nOnboarding\nJUDI\n33:04 \nSo Harsh, what are your expectations of next steps for this?\nHARSH\n33:10 \nSo the next steps on my part here would be that, I mean I just really wanted to validate this whole thing that if it's doable or not and looks like it is. So the next steps would be to… discuss the responsibilities and who would be building the recipes in the system.\nOnboarding ends\nHARSH\n33:28 \nSo that is the, that is the first thing I want to discuss real quick moving forward. We have come up with some Docebo university courses for recipe building and, you know, enablement on Docebo connect. So who would be taking on those courses to get this piece up and running? That is the two major questions that I have in mind. So… anyone who you think Judi or Janet please?\nJUDI\n33:57 \nYeah, Janet team would be responsible for creating those sample courses in the sandbox environment. I believe she's already started working on those. So we just so I guess if I understand you just need a couple of example courses in there, that would be representative, you need some users setup that would have the right additional fields beyond that, what do you need?\nIntegrations\nHARSH\n34:27 \nSo, so this will just be set up to build the… build starting of the recipe like link the plan for the recipes. So when I say recipe that someone needs to go into Docebo connect in your environment and start building the recipes just like we talked last time about that, right? So recipe building would be either on its end or on Johnstone. And so I need to make sure that who would be the right person who I can enable on recipe building. So, you know, people going into this system right here started starting building recipes from scratch. And when I said recipe recipes are just… as systematic way of aligning or creating a logical flow from Docebo to Nate. So for example, getting a, doing a get call from Docebo and then getting that data, pushing the data into net… authentication. So this whole setup needs to be done… by a system called recipe and that recipe needs to be built by either Nate or… by Johnstone, someone in Johnstone.\nIntegrations ends\nHARSH\n35:47 \nSo I need to figure out, I need to know who would be doing this so that I can talk to them, enable them on this whole process. And, you know, be a contact to them to make sure that if they have some issue while building recipes, I can probably help them out with that.\nIntegrations\nJANET\n36:04 \nI would think that would.\nJUDI\n36:06 \nWhile I was just wondering if Jason, I mean if we give you access to that with that streamline this process, if you wanted to build that recipe directly in there?\nJASON\n36:24 \nI will have to say, I don't really know how much that would be helpful. I'm not familiar with their system, so.\nHARSH\n36:38 \nI mean, I, I'll be more than happy to talk.\nJASON\n36:45 \nAll right. I was off in another window for a second. What are we considering?\nJANET\n36:53 \nSo I'm just thinking that since measure learning is a third party, we would incur some kind of fee to have Jason do that… versus having me do it because it looks like we'll only need… one recipe, right?\nIntegrations ends\nJANET\n37:11 \nAnd that would connect the fields with the fields in the list that Harsh was sharing on screen. Am I correct in that Harsh? Yep. That's true. So I think I would be more familiar with that than Jason or anybody else from measure learning would be?\nJUDI\n37:33 \nOkay. As long as you feel comfortable with it, yeah, I do. All right. Then that's the answer. Harsh. I guess Janet is your person.\nHARSH\n37:46 \nFact. But can I really want to understand? See, I can guide you with enablement… I can help you with what to look for, where to look for, but a very quick question on this. Do you feel comfortable playing around with APIs and data points and creating variables into the system?\nJANET\n38:12 \nI have not dealt with APIs before, but I have some computer programming background so I feel comfortable with variables and such.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Judi and the team discussed the possibility of leveraging the existing API for Harsh's project with Docebo.\n• Jason proposed setting up postman as a tool to exercise endpoints and replicate problems if needed.\n• Harsh requested to identify who would be responsible for building recipes in Docebo Connect, to which Judi suggested Janet's team.\n• Janet expressed she felt comfortable building the recipe, given her computer programming background. END"}
{"prompt":"HARSH\n38:23 \nPerfect. So I can actually pass on some enablement. So we recently came out with some university courses specifically targeting recipe development and very basic courses. But super helpful, I will pass on those courses to you and those courses would be able to get you to up to speed to start configuring this.\nOnboarding\nHARSH\n38:46 \nAnd I know we haven't officially kicked off the connect project. This is just for the enablement, you know, the feasibility check, but I want to give you a head of time so that when we kick this off, we, you know, straight dive into the project and get it up and running.\nJANET\n39:00 \nSounds good.\nHARSH\n39:03 \nPerfect.\nJUDI\n39:04 \nJust for I'm sorry, I mean to interrupt the finish.\nHARSH\n39:11 \nNo, I was just think this will, those are the most of my questions. Anyone else has some questions? So please go.\nJUDI\n39:20 \nOne thing I just wanted to lay out in terms of timing on this. What our hope was that we would be able to complete the connect setup by April eighteenth according to the current project timeline… and have it validated and tested and basically finalize no later than may 20 sixth. So, does that timeline seem realistic to you Harsh and to you Nate?\nHARSH\n39:59 \nSo, from my perspective, this sounds doable. But again, this also depends on how much time we're ready to put into the project, right? So getting this up and running shouldn't take that long. It's mostly how quickly we can build the recipes, put them into testing. So if I were to say that we start this project by let's say March first or maybe March first week. And again, that is totally up to Johnstone.\nNext Steps\nHARSH\n40:33 \nI am not in the area to start the onboarding without you folks. So let me know whenever you want to start it. And from that point of time, I expect around five to six weeks for all of us to feel comfortable.\nJUDI\n40:49 \nOkay. We're out of the office at our national sales meeting, the week of the March sixth. So it would be if we tentatively set a kickoff… like March fourteenth… would that work for you?\nHARSH\n41:10 \nYeah, yeah, absolutely. We can do March fourteenth. I mean, that week, I'm not absolutely sure about March fourteenth, but yeah, that week sounds.\nJUDI\n41:19 \nRight. Or I guess the week of March thirteenth… and then that assuming we get started that week… have that integration set configured and everything by April eighteenth, roughly. So.\nMIKE\n41:38 \nWould you wanna test by the, is that you suggesting that we would start testing it after the eighteenth?\nJUDI\n41:45 \nYeah, yeah. That was, I guess it depends on how that whole project schedule works with Harsh. I know they have a standard process they work through for the sure. So according to our layout, our schedule, we would wanna make sure that we'd have the configuration done by the eighteenth and then testing validation and everything complete no later than may 20 sixth.\nNext Steps ends\nMIKE\n42:11 \nOkay. Jason and Suja. Any… you see any issues with that from, you know, all things being equal, is that feasible?\nJASON\n42:26 \nIt's us speak for me. I don't know what? I don't know what my commitments are.\nJASON\n42:37 \nAnd she can't on mute. So.\nJUDI\n42:42 \nOkay. Well, why don't you guys to, on that and then get back to me?\nNext Steps\nMIKE\n42:45 \nYeah, I…\nJUDI\n42:46 \nFeel that you have any concerns about that time line? Same goes for you. Harsh. If you feel that there are any challenges with that timing, let me know. But otherwise, I'd like to assume that we're gonna start following that schedule.\nHARSH\n43:06 \nYeah. For me, that works perfectly fine. I guess one month for configuring and one month for testing. That is exactly what I had in mind because if we begin on March fourteenth, we have exactly eight weeks, that is two months and that's what we're splitting for, right? So, it sounds perfectly fine for me.\nJUDI\n43:26 \nOkay. Terrific.\nNext Steps ends\nHARSH\n43:30 \nOkay. Any other questions team?\nJUDI\n43:37 \nNot that I can think of right now.\nMIKE\n43:38 \nNot for me.\nJANET\n43:40 \nNo, I'm on.\nGURMINDER\n43:41 \nGood. I'm good.\nJASON\n43:45 \nYes. So, put her comments in the chat. Sounds like we're okay. As long as we don't run into any big unexpected… problem?\nJANET\n43:53 \nSo, we just need, we do need a confirmation from Jason about the changing from chart to postman or something else that will use the rest API.\nNext Steps\nJASON\n44:08 \nYeah, no, these are just test harnesses. These are not going to be used by the actual CEO system.\nJUDI\n44:17 \nRight. So, Harsh, is there a, do we need to get a kickoff meeting on the schedule for the week of the thirteenth? Or is that something you'll reach back out to us on to get on the schedule.\nWrap-Up\nHARSH\n44:29 \nI will, I'll absolutely reach out to you folks with some timings and I'll keep in mind that something we need to get this going on in the week of March thirteenth. So I'll reach out to you.\nJANET\n44:40 \nSounds.\nJUDI\n44:41 \nGood. Okay. Terrific. Thank you. And thank you, germender and Jason, Mike, such really appreciate your time today. Bye.\nGURMINDER\n44:51 \nThank you, everybody.\nHARSH\n44:53 \nThanks everyone.\nJASON\n44:54 \nBye. Thank you.\nJUDI\n44:56 \nBye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Harsh, Janet ,Judi, Mike, Jason, and Gurminder discussed onboarding and next steps for the connect project.\n• Harsh will provide enablement courses to be up-to-speed for configuring the project.\n• The goal is to have configuration complete by April 18th and testing finalized by May 26th. \n• Harsh will reach out to schedule a kickoff meeting in the week of March 13th.

{"prompt":"STEVEN\n0:00 \nHi, John. How's it going?\nDAMASO\n0:01 \nI'm good, Steve. How are you?\nSTEVEN\n0:03 \nDoing just fine. I, I'm a little croky today, catching a cold, I believe. But anyway.\nDAMASO\n0:11 \nGood. No worries. Hope you feel better. How was your vacation last week?\nSTEVEN\n0:15 \nFantastic. We cruise down to Mexico. It's pretty easy. It's pretty easy to do out of Houston. Yeah, also port down there allows you to go pretty easily.\nDAMASO\n0:30 \nWas it, was it a cruise?\nSTEVEN\n0:32 \nOr, yeah, we went on a cruise with some friends, had a good time, but, you know, any time you go on a cruise with 3,000 people, you might come back with something more than a suntan.\nDAMASO\n0:46 \nRight. Glad to hear that you had a good time and I know there was a lot to come back to, right? So.\nOnboarding\nSTEVEN\n0:53 \nYeah, lots going on. But anyway…\nDAMASO\n0:57 \nI appreciate you taking the time to catch up.\nSTEVEN\n0:58 \nWith…\nDAMASO\n0:59 \nMe here on short notice. I really just wanted to make sure that you know, myself and someone from your team and I'm glad it's you had the chance to kinda connect briefly just to kind of align on now that the decision has been made and you all intend to move forward with the, which is greatly exciting to you and the team for, you know, the work that you put in for, you know, one conveying our business case and, you know, getting the executive alignment that you all want it to kinda have them feel the same way that you all did. So now, it's just a matter of, you know, tying up some loose ends, finishing up these last steps and getting you all in a position to not only sign off but eventually begin the transition process so that we can look towards a kick off from here, right?\nSTEVEN\n1:42 \nRight. Exactly.\nOnboarding ends\nDAMASO\n1:43 \nYeah. So all good stuff, I guess question for you out of curiosity, I guess since, you know, wasn't able to be a fly on the wall, so to speak, what kind of went down during the conversation yesterday? I guess what feedback came up from the group or, you know, and what things were conveyed and so on to just kinda get them on your side when it comes to moving forward to the.\nSTEVEN\n2:05 \nWell, anytime we do calls like this, we try to get… the parties involved that will be, you know, using the system or supporting the system. So we had our director of it on the call. We had a on the call because he is our what I call my super user.\nDAMASO\n2:23 \nYep, right?\nSTEVEN\n2:23 \nAnd of course, myself and Kaitlyn, and then we did a call with our chief operating officer and, you know… we were able, I think to present a pretty good story even though, you know, I think we may have told you. I don't know. I mean, we were down to probably four principal vendors and it was you and Tovuti were, that were the closest matched. And, you know, axe really like your system capabilities, ease of use, all that kind of stuff much better than Tovuti. And then we also talked to a company called sir tech and Absorb and we liked Absorb but they were again much more expensive. They were closer to 92 dollars a person versus, you know, where you came in at 51. And I appreciate you really, you know, squeezing the prices there, accommodating to us because, you know, our company's one that's very frugal. Don't like to spend a whole lot of extra money unless we, you know, can really build a good value proposition why we need to do that? Which we were able to do. So at the end of the day, it was a clear choice as far as we were concerned that, you know, your system really met all of the criteria that we wanted.\nDAMASO\n3:51 \nYeah, no, that's amazing feedback. And I appreciate you sharing that with us.\nPayment Gateway\nDAMASO\n3:54 \nYou know, when it comes to the discounts and things like that, I think what made that? I'm not gonna say that it was super easy to send to do the arm wrestling on you all's behalf. But what allowed me to get the approvals that we were able to secure for you all in this case in the form of discounts, right?\nPayment Gateway ends\nDAMASO\n4:10 \nWas, you know, really the common theme was we are so confident and so excited about this project specifically because it truly like one of those that falls right down the bulls eye as far as organizations and use cases that we are very well and uniquely positioned to support, right? And so it was one of those situations where we knew that this would be successful if we could just get you all in. So we wanted to try to make it as easy as possible. You know, have those conversations that you had internally, you know, as easy as possible.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n4:44 \nBut have by, you know, obviously breaking things down the way that we did. So, you know, again it's a collaborative effort. We appreciate all both yourself as an Alan and the rest of the team, all of your hard work to help get us to this point. And obviously, you know, getting the rest of the team involved and on our side on this too. So now it's just a matter of, you know, crossing the TS, dotting the eyes and getting things done. So from a process standpoint, just to kinda let you know, there's even been steps taken between I guess yesterday when we got the news and even up until now, so I got the legal contacts that you all had sent. I am currently working now, we have like an internal system that we use to send over our legal documentation. It's relatively new. So we're still trying to, you know, get familiar with it. But in any case, from a process standpoint, what you can expect is that we are finalizing the paperwork I expect to have that sent out to your legal team or your legal contacts by the end of the day to day, you know, I think one thing that's kinda critical to all this. And, you know, I bring this as up as like just a gentle reminder specifically since, you know, kinda played into your decision making process, the content that discount specifically that was given and approved with the contingency that, you know, the expectation would be that we could get you all to sign before the end of this month. And so we don't have all the time in the world, just a few business days left. But I think with that in mind here, I think it should allow. Us, the opportunity to be able to have enough time to have your team review the documentation, make sure we're comfortable with it. And then obviously, if there's any questions or any things that we need to go back and forth on quickly, then we certainly can't my legal team has been appraised. So the situation as well. So once that process is started, I expect that we should be able to go through that, you know, relatively painlessly.\nPayment Gateway\nDAMASO\n6:40 \nBut yeah, just wanted to kinda let you know what's going on there. Yeah, separately, what we got going on the accounts payable side. So I got the contact information for the group that will be handling invoicing and things like that. I'm currently having my accounting and finance group provide to your accounts payable team W9 so that we can go ahead and get set up as a vendor inside of your registration system.\nPayment Gateway ends\nDAMASO\n7:05 \nSo, all good there. And then the only other thing that really will require you input, okay? If you don't have an answer yet, but it is something that I would have you all think about leading up to, you know, the time of signature is that platform URL which I know we already have. It seems like a little bit of exchange back and forth internally.\nSTEVEN\n7:24 \nWith the…\nDAMASO\n7:25 \nTeam, as far as what you want that to be, I do remember before that ST gen university, right? Or stgenix university that's something that had previously been discussed, I think actually brought it up even on our first meeting. So either way, whatever you will settle in on that's fine not to say that it couldn't change after the fact. We just need something to go off to help spin up that initial installation. And then from there, you all can modify it as you see fit. But it's just something to, you know, give us to go off of at least from the beginning so we can allow you access to the production.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso and Steven talked about the decision to move forward with onboarding for their business, which was made with executive alignment. \n• The process requires some final steps before transitioning, including discount approvals that need to be finalized before the end of the month. \n• Documents have been prepared for legal review and accounts payable setup is underway. \n• Damaso asked for input on the platform URL which had previously been discussed. END"}
{"prompt":"STEVEN\n8:00 \nYeah. I think the sdgn university is a good place to start. That's part of our theme that we're trying to build with employee development and, you know, it'll encompass a number of different things. I mean, live kind of live instruction as well as, you know, the information and course work that will pull down from, you know, from your system, one question I did have is sure as talking to Acel and our CEO is very, you know, proprietary information sensitive. I'll put it that way. And I asked axe, I said, you know, in your conversations, did you find any issues with us keeping our proprietary information that axelcreates off your servers in the cloud? And I can't remember where we ended with that.\nDAMASO\n8:54 \nYeah, that would have been a part of kind of the security documentation that we had shared with both action.\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n9:01 \nI believe run right? Is the director of it as a member of that team. So that was a part of that process. Those documents that would have been shared contains all of our infrastructure and architecture when it comes to it security protocols, processes, and so on. So I'll put it to you this way one that had already been reviewed and approved, which is good. But then too, you know, by virtue of us having so many enterprise customers with a lot of strict security requirements, right? I'm talking about the Aws is the amazons, the walmart, the, you know, Zoom and so on, right? You don't get to partner with those companies and support them as customers unless you get brought through the ringer from a security standpoint. And so it's kinda the, by working with such enterprise clients like that, you know, the largest organizations in the world by virtual working with them and being brought through that stringent, you know, requirements and security process detail. That just means that the rest of our customers that we work with, not to say that you all don't have just a strict, you know, requirements but, you know, you are the beneficiaries of us having to already go through that process and you get the benefit of having access to, you know, all the, you know, same security requirements and details that we offer to all of our.\nSTEVEN\n10:17 \nCustomer. So, okay.\nDAMASO\n10:20 \nI is there, but it's not a concern to us at all whatsoever. When it comes to the hosting of your proprietary confidential information, it will stay with you. We don't take any ownership rights which you'll see in the legal documentation that will be shared. We don't take any ownership rights over the content that you load in there.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAMASO\n10:38 \nWhat's yours that you put in is yours. And so even let's say down the road… if we decide to conclude the partnership at some point, we don't hold onto that information. There's an export and extraction process by which you take all of your content with you. In this case, all the proprietary confidential information that you may decide to bring in. And then we delete those records.\nPricing\nSTEVEN\n10:58 \nYeah. Another question that I gotten from the coo, was we're gonna be probably a pretty highly acquisitive company here pretty soon, cool, meaning that we priced at a 1,000 person count, right?\nDAMASO\n11:15 \nOkay.\nSTEVEN\n11:16 \nSo, his question was, I see you price this at like 305 100,000, 1,500. What happens if we jump up to three or 4,000? How would costing be affected at that point?\nDAMASO\n11:30 \nYeah. So, essentially, how that will?\nSTEVEN\n11:31 \nWork?\nDAMASO\n11:32 \nIs because we already have these discounts that have already been applied to your agreement process here. And this is kind of mutual understanding is that those same discounts are going to be applied to any higher tier plans you may decide to upgrade into. And it's actually a pretty standard business practice as far as you know, let's say you all decide when you're ready to upgrade to a higher tier plan. And if we're starting at a 1,000, in this case, let's say you know, three, four or 5,000 whenever, and this could happen six months in a year, end many years end up to you.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n12:04 \nBut essentially what happens is once you make that decision to upgrade your plan, you simply just have to let your account manager know which will be someone like myself just on the other side of the fence working as your primary point of contact and let's call them the relationship map manager.\nPricing\nDAMASO\n12:19 \nBut also, you know, your Docebo expert, their an ongoing support. You let them know they'll have you sign off on something that will be co terminus with your original agreement. And then from there, you will be given immediate access to in this example, that higher tier threshold of monthly active users. In terms of your plan. So jump from a 1,000 to 3,000, for example, you'll be given immediate access to that higher threshold. And then for you all, you will simply be prorated the difference with those original discounts applied as prorate the difference on your next annual invoice, which in this case will be the anniversary date of our official contract starting. So pretty standard business practice, we try to make that process super easy for you all. So when you decide you're ready, it will be at your discretion and at your leisure to be able to make those upgrades and be given immediate access to.\nSTEVEN\n13:13 \nRight, because that was a question he asked and I said, well, we've only priced it through about 1,500 users. We haven't gone to three or 4,000. So I would imagine that the cost, you know, per person per month.\nDAMASO\n13:29 \nThe user scale continue to expand. You know, as you can imagine that's a part of the kinda tiering system. The more that you purchase from us in terms of volume of users, the price per user per month continues to go down. And then the benefit for you all here is because you've already secured these discounts upfront. Those would then be extended to those plans if…\nSTEVEN\n13:50 \nRight. And that's kinda the way I explained it to him, I said the cost per person… per month would drop the overall cost for everything.\nPricing ends\nSTEVEN\n14:01 \nOf course, the annual subscription class would go up because you got now more people. And yeah, so he was quizzing me on that and I said, I don't exactly know what those discounts would apply the.\nDAMASO\n14:14 \nYou're on the right track, you're thinking about the.\nSTEVEN\n14:17 \nOkay. All right. Well, that's good.\nPricing\nSTEVEN\n14:21 \nLet's see if there was anything else… the payments per month. How does that work? There's an initial implementation, right? So we'd have to pay for that upfront. And then there's a cost per month, you know, how does that work?\nDAMASO\n14:43 \nYeah. So from a billing standpoint, essentially how it works is while we do track engagement monthly for you, all we do Bill upfront annual, right?\nPricing ends\nDAMASO\n14:53 \nSo in terms of invoicing, you do have a couple of options and you just let me know what you would prefer because it's actually good that we're discussing this now because that would then influence what I do in the final paperwork which I'm preparing. Now, you have three options.\nPricing\nDAMASO\n15:09 \nYou can either choose to pay upfront annually… for the annual subscription cost, which in this case, what 51,000 dollars and some change for the platform subscription and access to content, additional one time fee for onboarding, right? Which we know is only gonna be applicable and build upfront in year one. You don't have to worry about any time after the fact.\nSTEVEN\n15:30 \nRight.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Steven and Damaso discussed the security protocols Docebo has in place to protect proprietary information, as well as the fact that content belonging to clients is not taken ownership of. \n• The pricing structure was also covered, with discounts being applied to any higher tier plans when upgrading and immediate access being given upon upgrade. END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n15:31 \nSo that's option number one, option number two is you could choose to go off of a semi annual billing schedule. In other words, break up those payments into twice a year. So pretty much half it. And then you would just be paying twice out of the year or those apps or we could also do a quarterly billing schedule as well. So whatever you might prefer, it's up to you. But typically, what we'll do is just go off.\nSTEVEN\n15:54 \nThat annual subscription. All right. So if we want to go annual, want to go semi annual, we want to go quarterly or monthly even.\nDAMASO\n16:03 \nNo option for?\nSTEVEN\n16:05 \nNo options for monthly. And then I take it at the end of a quarter, let's say we went quarterly, you're going to get discounts for we would get discounts for, of course, we pay the whole year upfront. I guess cost of money, right?\nDAMASO\n16:20 \nThose same discounts that are applied to the annual subscription would be applied to the quarterly break up as far as how we, you know, break up those quarterly payments. So either way, you know, it's gonna end up costing the same for you. All, it just really is a matter of preference on your end as far as.\nSTEVEN\n16:38 \nThere is no advantage then to paying an annual subscription upfront?\nDAMASO\n16:43 \nSo, no, not in this case, so it's really up to you again if you want to break it up into those quarterly payments, which would be the most frequent option that we offer, you can do that if you so choose. Otherwise, you have the semi annual or annual option to.\nSTEVEN\n16:59 \nOkay. And then the other question I have is let's say we go quarterly and you have let's say we pay for a 1,000 users, only 700 use it in one month, maybe 1,200 use it in another month, maybe 500 in another month. How do you account for that differences in user?\nDAMASO\n17:24 \nYeah.\nSTEVEN\n17:25 \nUsers.\nDAMASO\n17:26 \nThe analogy I like to use is imagine Docebo being like a 1,000 persons seat theater, right? And so each month you have a show that you're in this case, your trainings, right? That you're conducting. And so we understand how the active user model works, meaning you're only going to be charged for a seat or not. I don't wanna say charge, but you're not going to be counted for a seat unless you come in and press play on content, right? And so this theater only has seats for a 1,000 people in this case. And so you have a standing room only situation. And if like, you know, you have, you know, 1,100 people come in a given month on a plan of 1,000 that's fine. We're not going to restrict access to those people. They could stay in the back. So to speak, we're keeping up with the analogy, but the intent is on a monthly basis to stay under that a 1,000 seat thresholds, right? So there is no carry over anything like that next month comes around. Your active user account resets to zero. In other words, we have a new show that starting new groups of people coming in, taking those seats and so on. And so that's what we track in terms of engagement on a monthly basis, right?\nSTEVEN\n18:40 \nYeah. If we're paying for a 1,000 users and let's just say in a quarter, we only have 500 each month. And so we run well below that 1,000. Is there a reduction or you just pay the flat 1,000?\nDAMASO\n18:56 \nPay the flat cost, but that's also where we had addressed that concern upfront by applying the 29 percent discount because think about it this way. I think that even brings you more than beneath what it would cost list price for a 500 monthly activation plan. So that was kinda the logic and applying that discount to the a 1,000 plan so that you wouldn't really even have to worry about those situations. You're pretty much paying less than what you would for a 500 planned list price. But you're getting access to a 1,000 see fever in this case?\nSTEVEN\n19:28 \nRight. And then of course, if you go over then you're charged like five.\nDAMASO\n19:32 \nFive dollars and 90 cents per user per month that you have in excess of your plan. So that's why I think to go back to your earlier point. If you begin to notice that you are regularly blowing past your 1,000 threshold, then that would be a conversation that you would then want to have. And we could offer guidance to you on this as well because I want you to do what ends up being is economical and we'll help you make those decisions. If it ends up being a situation where it's just a handful of users every now and then that you have an excess, you know, it would be cheaper for you all just to go with the overage fee route. Or if you are regularly blowing past it, then that would be a conversation for you all to then consider upgrading to a higher to your plan to then accommodate that expanded user ship that you're seeing regularly. So, and then that goes back to the process we talked about earlier where we make it easy for you all to upgrade at any.\nSTEVEN\n20:25 \nOr if we see that we just don't see more than 500 users in the near term, we could just drop it back to the 500. So.\nDAMASO\n20:32 \nSo that's scenario because you are essentially paying for a cheaper than 500 rate by getting access to be a 1,000 anyways, there wouldn't necessarily be any need to do that because that's what the discounts. The reason why they were replied in the way that they were was because of the volume that you're purchasing right out the gate, the 1,000. And then from there, obviously the term length three years in this case and so on. So that's kinda the logic that went into us getting the discounts that we requested approved. Is one, first we pull volume two term length, and then three, the products that are being purchased, you know, in this case content in addition to the LMS. So those are the factors of pain, getting the discounts that we got secured for you all. And so it wouldn't necessarily be where you would have to downgrade or do anything like that, but it gives you the flexibility to have that higher to your plan to accommodate the higher levels of engagement that we expect. But then eventually put you in a position to go ahead and upgrade from.\nPricing ends\nSTEVEN\n21:41 \nRight. Right. All right. Well, that it behooves us to really go sell our LMS system.\nDAMASO\n21:47 \nYeah, right.\nSTEVEN\n21:48 \nInternational, you know.\nDAMASO\n21:50 \nYeah. And you got to think about it this way too. I mean compare to what you're currently LMS today, you can only expect your engagement figures to continue to go up, right? I'm sure there's going to be a lot of excitement generated by having this offering, right? And there's going to be a lot more learning opportunities that you all are going to be afforded by adopting Docebo and having more training and enabling opportunities outside of what you traditionally been doing this far. So even compare to what you're doing today, you could expect that figure to continue to go up. And as your learning program continues to mature, that's where even with outside of what we've already scoped short term, that's where you'll be to go in and get hired whenever.\nSTEVEN\n22:30 \nRight. And then all these elements are outlined in the terms and conditions.\nNext Steps\nDAMASO\n22:33 \nYeah, exactly. You'll see all of that in the work that we put together for you all. So I guess the only other real question that I have for you all. And actually I'm looking at the clock, I had this for 15 minutes, actually do have another appointment to jump to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso and Steven discussed the various payment options for their LMS system, including annual, semiannual, and quarterly subscription plans. \n• All details were outlined in the terms and conditions put together by Damaso END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n22:49 \nBut the only thing I really would need is the billing schedule. Do you think for now we should keep it at the annual or do you think the team?\nSTEVEN\n22:58 \nNo, I think for right now, let's go quarterly.\nDAMASO\n23:01 \nOkay.\nSTEVEN\n23:03 \nExcuse me. Let's just go quarterly for right now.\nDAMASO\n23:06 \nOkay.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n23:06 \nI got you. And if that means a change, it's not a major change. But at least for the sake of finalizing the paperwork to then send for review, I do need to go ahead and update that. So I'll do so. Now, once I have that change, then we'll share that documentation with your team later today or if you have any questions or if your legal counsel has any questions or comments or suggestion edits for us, then process is have them either redline the document or they include their comments or edits in the body of an email.\nNotifications\nDAMASO\n23:38 \nOur legal team is going to be copied in CC on our exchange of those documents. And so just simply reply all to that threat. And I'm telling you to your point of contact there… have them reply all to that email. Our legal team will then work in collaboration with you.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n23:56 \nPretty much let the legal focus or thing. Once we come to mutual agreement, the paperwork will be finalized and then I have you marked as the official signatory for this. Is that still going to be?\nSTEVEN\n24:06 \nYeah, that's fine.\nDAMASO\n24:07 \nOkay, perfect. So once we get to that point, let's say everything looks good. We come to mutual agreement from a legal perspective and we're ready to sign off. Just so you know, now the process pretty straightforward, we use DocuSign here for all of our electronic signatures. So what's going to happen is once we generate clean copies of the entire agreement, it will package together. And then a copy of that agreement will be sent to you first for execution. Once you sign off on your portions, then a ST Genetics signed copy of the agreement will then be relayed to in this case, our official signatory which is our president. Col. Also, he's already been notified that this is something likely to come over the course of the next few days. So waiting by the computer, so to speak to execute it as soon as possible. So once he signs off on page portion of it, then a mutually execute a copy of the agreement will then be sent to both parties for record keeping. And then from there is when we begin the transition process from an internal perspective, what you can expect is we'll have internal discussions with our team, have resource assignments made within two business days of the signed contract. You can expect outreach from your assigned account manager to then, you know, kind of allow you access to production instance, and then they'll keep you in communication with regards to scheduling for our official kickoff call once the other resources have assigned. But typically that process works. So just to give…\nIntegrations\nSTEVEN\n25:38 \nI mean the only other, the only other point I'm not clear on is how we will extract our information from share knowledge.\nDAMASO\n25:46 \nYeah, that is all that will all be facilitated in the data migration sow that will also be attached to this as well. So keep that in mind. So the data migration stuff because it's all been scoped that will be included here. And that process essentially entails our assistance in, you know, helping your team bring over your share knowledge data into the note.\nSTEVEN\n26:09 \nRight. And I think that data migration, I can't remember the cost three 5,000 dollars, something like that.\nPricing\nDAMASO\n26:14 \nIt's like 2,700 or somethi…\nSTEVEN\n26:17 \n25, yeah, 25 27. Okay. All right. No problem. There. There was a question about having another group that we use internally to do it but actually was looking at that and say what makes the most sense. But right now, I would prefer just to have you guys do it. You know, your system way better than anybody else.\nPricing ends\nDAMASO\n26:37 \nSorry, right?\nSTEVEN\n26:38 \nThat would be my preference. Of course.\nDAMASO\n26:40 \nOkay. No worries. And we always are happy to partner with your team. If there's you know, it's kind of a dual situation, right? We know our systems the best, you all know, your systems the best, right? So if we can work in conjunction and partnership there, it will only make it for a smooth transition once we get to.\nWrap-Up\nSTEVEN\n26:56 \nAll right. Sounds like you got it covered.\nDAMASO\n26:59 \nAll right. Yep, twice before you can hopefully tell. But anyways, if you have any questions, Steve, please reach out directly, let me know. Otherwise, I'll keep you posted on the follow up action items that I promise. And then if anything, just so you are aware, I am traveling on site for a customer meeting tomorrow.\nNext Steps\nDAMASO\n27:16 \nSo I'll be largely out of pocket. And then Friday, I do have the day off to, you know, accommodate travel for me coming back, but I'll be back in the office back in the mix on Monday and Tuesday, not to say that I won't be available via email or if you shoot me a text for something for whatever reason, I expect hopefully over the course of the next few days, let's say fingers crossed. We finalize our legal agreement and put us in a position to have you all sign off either by the end of this week or maybe Monday, Tuesday at the latest, right?\nSTEVEN\n27:43 \nPerfect. Sounds like a winter.\nDAMASO\n27:45 \nAll right. Sounds good. Well, again, thanks against you and the rest of the team for all your hard work.\nWrap-Up\nDAMASO\n27:49 \nWe'll be in touch if you have any questions, reach out and let me know. Otherwise, I'll let you get back to it and we'll hopefully get things wrapped up here. So.\nSTEVEN\n27:56 \nAll right, John. Thanks.\nDAMASO\n27:57 \nAll right. Take care. Have a good.\nSTEVEN\n27:58 \nOne.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso and Steven discussed billing schedule and decided to keep it quarterly.\n• Damaso mentioned the process of finalizing paperwork and collaboration with legal team.\n• Data migration is included in scope of agreement and estimated cost was confirmed at $2700.\n• Finalization of agreement is expected by end of week or latest by Monday/Tuesday.

It's good to meet you.\nMADELINE\n0:12 \nNice to meet you.\nEMILY\n0:15 \nHow long have you been with snow to?\nMADELINE\n0:17 \nTwo and a half months?\nEMILY\n0:19 \nHoly cow.\nMADELINE\n0:20 \nActually. Awesome. Yeah, yeah, so.\nSmall Talk ends\nEMILY\n0:23 \nVery much like on the roller coaster.\nMADELINE\n0:26 \nYeah, I used to work at DocuSign. So I manage all their partnership. So that's how I met them, but yeah, I was doing DocuSign which is like pretty basic. And now, no to like definitely a learning curve for sure.\nEMILY\n0:43 \nI can imagine. Yeah, we use DocuSign internally here. We're clients of theirs. So… yeah, very familiar. In fact, getting DocuSign is usually the best part of a salesperson's day. So love to see their little name pop up in my Inbox.\nMADELINE\n1:00 \nSure.\nEMILY\n1:02 \nBut yeah. Well, it's good to meet you. I've been working with Travis internet as you probably know, and it's funny. I think even Travis thought that we were a little like further along than we actually were. I don't know like what he's told you internally and all that. But I definitely think that our only way forward based on what he shared with me at this point is like what you're gonna do is essentially dig into the Docebo product. I will work with you as much as I can. Unfortunately, a lot of times when folks have like the situation that Travis has explained that you'll have, which is basically proving to the business and to the CC that like it's worth it, essentially that there's ROI, unfortunately, a lot of times with LMS. Is it's basically impossible to do that without just freaking buying the platform? And like putting people in it, it's kind of the bane of my existence sometimes to be really Frank with you because it's just the way that it is like we can give you a case study after case study. We can let you speak to a client referral. We can let you do all these. We can let you do what you're about to do test and play with the platform. Like we can let you do all of that. But a lot of times C levels and executives, they just don't you know, they don't buy into it. So anyway.\nMADELINE\n2:23 \nAnd that's part. And just my, I was in sales or DocuSign. So like…\nEMILY\n2:27 \nOkay. So, you get.\nMADELINE\n2:28 \nYeah. I said I actually was on the demo that I think you and your SE did and it was just so funny being on the other side because I'm like I was the people. And now I'm like on the side. So, no, I totally understand like where you're coming from. And I'm appreciative that you guys are letting us have that sandbox or whatever we decide to do appreciative for that.\nEMILY\n2:50 \nSure. Yeah. Well, and like I said, this, sometimes this is just part of it like for better or worse, sometimes we just have to allow people kind of more freedom and we're happy to do that. Like that is very much a part of the process sometimes so, but I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna share my screen with you and I've already got the demo pulled up like the demo environment pulled up. So I'm gonna and I'll send over in an email after our call today.\nLayout & Content\nEMILY\n3:20 \nI'll send over all the credentials so that you can like log in and get in here. But can you see where it says? I'm, moving my cursor over, get started. Okay? So this is when you log in as a learner and I don't know if you remember from the demo, but we very, we basically dumb it down like we streamlined this landing page, this dashboard to where like when we started off on the demo, it was a little busier and then we just like streamlined it. I can't remember if it was tenett asking us to do that or Travis, but someone did. And so we did that on the admin side. So you'll notice that like we still have some channels here. You can totally come in. You can customize anything you want, play around with literally anything that you think might be beneficial.\nMobile App\nEMILY\n4:08 \nAnd hold on one second. I forgot to share this with you. I'm also going to be sharing it's not, hold on. I haven't opened another tab on this other. Okay. I'm also gonna share this with you. Can you see I'm dragging something over to the screen?\nEMILY\n4:29 \nHold on. It's taking forever to load. This is like a trial. It's a G sheet just like a Google sheet and it literally walks you through the trial and it gives you links of like basically how to do. Yeah, exactly. So this is like the front page I haven't filled out like all of our calls that you had because it's kind of redundant at this point.\nUser Permission\nEMILY\n4:56 \nBut you can, if you want to create users of your own. Like right now, the log INS that I'm gonna send you are just very generic. It's learner, Power user and admin. And like you could use those. Travis could use us, connect like nobody. It doesn't matter. They're just generic. But if you wanted to come in and like create like using your Mattie croffered email address with no to create your actual profile. You could totally do that. And we just have this little area right here where you can keep track of like who you've created in the system if you want to practice like being a Power user and creating users on behalf of people, like a manager would do that kind of thing.\nLayout & Content\nEMILY\n5:35 \nThis is a place to help you do that. And then you can use however much of this you want. You do not have to use the whole thing. If it's like if you're the kind of person that, who's brand works this way, then go for it. If you're like all I'm gonna use is like literally this with the links to our knowledge base that's fine too. Like I don't care, but we'll send you this to help you along. So it'll basically kinda walk you through what you need to do. Now. Like I said, this is on the learner side. So we still have every single thing that we went over. And more, we have everything kinda turned on the learner side and you'll see here I extend or actually you can't see that I'm gonna log in as an admin.\nLayout & Content ends\nEMILY\n6:15 \nI extended this trial access at least until the end of March. I believe it was, I gave you a little over a full month now. Yeah, 37 days left. And when you're logged in as an admin, you can always see this up at the top left right corner.\nLayout & Content\nEMILY\n6:32 \nOkay? So, yeah. So like when you're in here, we have these three, you know, buttons basically that we created. They're just little widgets and these are kinda the three main things that you do as an admin. If at any point, when you're playing around, you wanna meet with me and probably my solutions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Madeline has been with Snowto for two and a half months\n• Emily shared her screen with Madeline and walked her through their demo environment and mobile app\n• Emily also provided generic log in credentials for users as well as a G sheet to help guide Madeline through the trial process which lasted until end of March \n• As an admin, three main functions were highlighted by Emily: creating widgets, creating users on behalf of managers and monitoring remaining trial days END"}
{"prompt":"EMILY\n6:48 \nConsulted to Matt that's totally fine. We can set up a 30 minute call but I know that it's most important for you all to figure out like what you need to see in here and what you need to prove internally. So like I'll just do your thing and then let us know when we can be helpful basically.\nOnboarding\nEMILY\n7:06 \nSo does that sound like what you like? Is that what you're comfortable with? Is that what you were hoping for?\nMADELINE\n7:11 \nYes, yes, I feel pretty confident that with the links and everything I'll be able too because I know your time is valuable but I think so just and I don't know how much Travis went into detail, but I on to help create processes because there's it's pretty much a start up there's not really any processes which again, is like a big jump coming from DocuSign where we have like everything.\nPayment Gateway\nMADELINE\n7:36 \nAnd now I'm like what the heck's going on? So we have like a set of 14 partners and that's like who we're tracking our revenue goals off of and those partners resell us, essentially send to be trained on how to sell us. So like that is why I want this thing because I'm like we can't keep doing it like emailing out this, emailing. It's just too manual like it needs to become self service.\nPayment Gateway ends\nEMILY\n8:06 \nSorry, go ahead.\nMADELINE\n8:07 \nI was just saying, so I wanna play around in like creating a channel because I remember that's how I was, each partner is gonna need their own different documents and another partner is gonna need.\nEMILY\n8:16 \nYes, and the look and feel you can here, let me actually screen share again.\nPayment Gateway\nEMILY\n8:20 \nI'll literally walk you. I don't know if you remember this and I can send you any of the recordings that we already have but being able to. So unless you purchase extended enterprise, which I don't know that we ever talked about that with Travis, a lot of our clients who do partner enablement or partner education, they will purchase a pack of extended enterprise which basically just gives you up to five different urls that you can use.\nLayout & Content\nEMILY\n8:47 \nAll you really need to know is in Docebo without extended enterprise, like just the basic LMS package, you can customize anything below this, no to logo right here. So anything below this line, that, where it says admin dashboard, this blue line, all of this, the entire dashboard could be like the partner's name and the partners logo and the partners colors and everything.\nPayment Gateway\nEMILY\n9:11 \nBut if you get extended enterprise, even this logo up here that currently says no to that could also be the partner's name logo in their URL. It would be like you could choose what it was, but it would be like no two dash like the partner name.\nMADELINE\n9:28 \nSo that gives you five urls. So that'll be like…\nEMILY\n9:30 \nSell them. Yeah, we sell them in packs of five. So like the first little pack is five URL, and then you can add on and add on from there. But like I said, a lot of our clients honestly who do the partner education, I would love to see a statistic of this.\nPayment Gateway ends\nEMILY\n9:46 \nActually, I'm gonna looking at this after we hang up, but it's kinda split down the middle as far as I can tell the folks who do opt to get extended enterprise and the folks who don't because honestly, the amount of customization that you could do without it is great, you know, and some people especially startups are always cost conscious. So you never wanna like, you know, hey, for something that you don't really need.\nMADELINE\n10:11 \nBecause that was the other question that had come up as a lot of these sales reps don't even know what no two is like they've never even heard of that because it's there, it's essentially supposed to be their product. So I don't want people coming in being like no two, I don't know what that is that a new, like I don't want that, yes, to have it branded to that partner. So it's like this is our own extension, you know?\nEMILY\n10:37 \nYeah. Okay. So in that case, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna turn on, I might have to get my SS help with this, but I'm gonna turn on, yeah, I have to get my SDS help here's. The little area of extended enterprise that you will come to. I'm gonna get him though. You and I will email back and forth of course, during this whole process, he's actually already created Wayne enterprises as a little like example for you all.\nMADELINE\n11:06 \nSo…\nEMILY\n11:06 \nPlay around with that. But I'm gonna get you to send me some of the partners. I mean, if you're allowed to share like some of the partners games, we can create some more of these little examples and just to give you more to play around with like literally if all it does is give you like a screenshot to be able to share with Travis or the executives or whoever like, okay, the more you can touch in the system, the better in my opinion to be able to prove like, okay, this is going to be valuable and I would encourage you. And obviously, we can talk more about this later. This is just meant to be an overview but reporting holy cow once hopefully fingers crossed, once they see what you are going to have visibility into with a system like Docebo and seeing what your partners are like doing for what they're not doing. And like how it correlates to sales, it's kind of a no brainer. In my opinion, it's easy for me to say but.\nMADELINE\n12:08 \nThe content that you uploaded to, sorry, this is going off topic. What is another question? Can that be downloaded?\nEMILY\n12:15 \nYeah, for sure. Yep. So let me show you.\nMADELINE\n12:18 \nIt. So it's not downloadable.\nEMILY\n12:20 \nUse either way. Yeah.\nMADELINE\n12:22 \nThis is another because I know like for revenue operations, this is where my head's up. But like tone and Travis, they have like different use cases that they want. So we're on different tracks. But the reason I'm saying that is because since we are white labeled with some of these partners, I don't want this to just be a site where they come and download and then like upload it in their own system. And then they never sign into Shape out because then it's a waste of money like that's where going?\nLearning Plans\nEMILY\n12:49 \nOkay. I'm with you. Okay?\nMADELINE\n12:50 \nYeah.\nEMILY\n12:51 \nSo what you're gonna do is let me show you in this course or it's a learning plan that we have uploaded, which a learning plan is just a compilation of courses that all achieve the same goal, you know, just like in any element, you can do that and they call them different things.\nLearning Plans ends\nEMILY\n13:04 \nThis one has an example of, yup. Okay. This is a widget, you can literally remove it if you don't want them on. This one has an example because it's the demo. Obviously, we want to show all of the things that we can do. This one does have an example of like a PDF in this case that you can download. However you can either completely remove this widget completely or like… in the actual course itself, see how right here. This is a powerpoint we uploaded it and it turns it into little slides over here. So you can kinda click through the pages and everything. This right here is an example of a file download that you can actually have as a part of the course. If you don't want them download. And anything, you wouldn't upload anything as a file download, you would upload it more like this like a slide show or something like that is not downloadable and you can lock it completely. Okay. Also, this might also be helpful to you could have different versions of things where like it would have one partner's, name on it is the same document but it's like branded differently. That would also maybe help to mitigate the downloading at least in, well, they would never be able to see something anyway that wasn't for.\nMADELINE\n14:24 \nWhich I know sounds and I didn't mean like this is a waste of money. I'm just trying to think like we're going to get. I don't want because some of our partners, they do have internal, they don't have LMS, but they have a confluence or like things like that and I want them to use this. I don't want them to come in and be like here's all the assets, download upload to confluence. And then they never sign in because no.\nEMILY\n14:46 \nOne part of that too, I mean, I know, you know this literally why they hired you, but like part of that too is making the system like super beneficial for them even outside of the resources. Like I don't know the appetite for gamification, but you might remember seeing like you can actually incentivize and reward them and it doesn't have to be like anything monetary like if you all eventually want to charge for courses on a course by course basis, if that's like even in the plans at all, you could have like in their reward shop, they could redeem their points for like a free course or a free, I don't know something you can get creative with it.\nMADELINE\n15:26 \nYeah.\nEMILY\n15:27 \nSo, yeah, a lot of that too is like how you build things like if all they use it for as a document repository. I see like there is risk there, you know, if all they're doing is come in here and come into this channel and literally downloading it, it's not great.\nMADELINE\n15:44 \nYeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily and Madeline discussed a payment gateway to create processes for a start up.\n• Emily offered extended enterprise with five URLs, as well as an explanation of what could be customized without extended enterprise.\n• Madeline asked whether content would be downloadable, to which Emily showed her how to customize the layout and control file downloads through the course.\n• Emily suggested using gamification to incentivize partners, making the system more beneficial than just a document repository. END"}
{"prompt":"EMILY\n15:45 \nYou know, but if they can come into like, I think I even think of like types of content like videos that they could watch that they have to be logged into, you know.\nMADELINE\n15:53 \nStuff like that and I want, hey, it's kinda hard because we're in a sticky situation where we can't tell the partner how to train their reps, you know, ideally, I'm like if you're hired onto this company and you don't know anything about what we do, you should be required to go into Docebo and complete.\nEMILY\n16:10 \nLike a certification track.\nMADELINE\n16:12 \nYeah, should be required but you can't make them require their sales, you know what I mean? So it's kind of like we're a little man a little bit, but that's like my vision with this is like that's right? Okay. You just made.\nEMILY\n16:25 \nThing, when we get, I can't get you a client referral yet because we have like, you know, threshold and qualifications that you have to meet before I can get you somebody. However, I already have a couple in mind that I've personally worked with last year and they have like a very similar use case to you. I'm gonna see if I can at least like set up a tentative meeting for…\nMADELINE\n16:50 \nFuture once.\nEMILY\n16:51 \nWe kinda have a little bit more of a game plan in place so that you can just like pick their brains.\nMADELINE\n16:57 \nThat be awesome.\nEMILY\n16:58 \nYeah, because honestly, like the L and D community is really small and close knit but the partner and customer education community is slightly more dispersed and folks kinda have a hard time sharing ideas because the jargon is sometimes different.\nMADELINE\n17:15 \nAnd yeah.\nEMILY\n17:15 \nLike you said, I mean, it's you're the middle man and it's kind of a weird gray area sometimes.\nMADELINE\n17:20 \nYes, it is. This is the way that it.\nEMILY\n17:23 \nIs so, anyway, I'm gonna try to thinking about you… and try to get you hooked up with somebody eventually, even if it's not like super.\nMADELINE\n17:33 \nNo.\nEMILY\n17:33 \nI, yeah, for sure. Now, tell me one more time. You are gonna be not you, but no, to, as a whole, you would be using it for your internal like stuff as well, right?\nMADELINE\n17:46 \nYes, I think that's the goal and that's another part of just a company that is so small, but everybody so disconnected a little bit on what they're doing. Yeah. So I know like what we want it for, but I know Travis and tenets team, they want it for something different. And then like there's another part of this is the company that would use it for something different too. So like there would be multiple use cases going on there, which is good getting everybody. So it's like everybody's kind of only thinking of like what they would use it for, not like another group which I think that happens like with everything, you know?\nEMILY\n18:20 \nYes.\nMADELINE\n18:23 \nSo, I know that they for sure wanna host like internal because right now everything's just in Sharepoint. Yeah.\nEMILY\n18:30 \nOkay. Well, as we work through everything and he gets you kind of, I feel like Travis into that made it almost to the end, well, to the end of the evaluation essentially. I mean, they…\nMADELINE\n18:45 \nNow.\nEMILY\n18:45 \nFrom a functional perspective, yeah, I mean, we could check the boxes like and even I got them on insane price that I literally, I don't know if I can, I don't know if I can hold that for them because it was just like absurdly low.\nMADELINE\n19:03 \nYeah.\nEMILY\n19:04 \nThat's the standpoint. But as you work your way through and as like the business case becomes stronger and stronger. Hopefully, it really will be easier to convince internal folks and it'll kinda just be a no brainer that's honestly that's what I see more often than not whenever we're in this situation and we kinda have like a little hurdle to get over. It eventually becomes like a no brainer and, you know… it's kinda hard to ignore. You know, how much better your lives will be.\nMADELINE\n19:36 \nYeah. With the system.\nEMILY\n19:37 \nSo, yeah, yeah. And now, as a good time, like, I know startup life, I was with Docebo before we went public, it was very startup and I know like the struggles, I mean, even as an LMS company, we felt the struggles even with like an LMS, you know. But so I can totally sympathize and like just keep me posted. Anything I can do, we will set up a call. We'll do whatever we need to do, just like I said, make your life easier now and then really hopefully make it easier in the future.\nMADELINE\n20:09 \nYeah. Okay. And I guess just the final question, I know we went over to some, one of the earlier calls is partner. I said, I know a couple of minutes of, they're gonna have their own channel. That would be the goal and the log in we had talked about like, I don't know like what, how much work does that take? Like time to do that in on how you want it? Yeah. How long are you gonna take to get these 14 channels set up? Is? What if the…\nEMILY\n20:41 \nNo, okay.\nMADELINE\n20:41 \nIs a separate thing, but I'm just wondering about like the log in the Permissions, like is that?\nEMILY\n20:47 \nYeah.\nOnboarding\nEMILY\n20:48 \nOkay. So first things, first, the shortest onboarding package that we have in the one that I quoted for Travis's project to begin with, is it?\nMADELINE\n20:57 \nAnd I'm sorry, I have, he hasn't told me anything about… just process.\nEMILY\n21:04 \nSo, it's eight weeks long. Okay? So you basically though here's the way I like to think that if you need to move faster than that, 100 percent fine. Moving slower is a different conversation because then obviously we'd have to like scope more time and, you know, get hairy, we can do it if we need to. But to answer your question that what you just described getting channel setup, getting users in the system, making sure they're like permission correctly, and they only see certain things especially if you have extended enterprise, getting all of that like set up is one of the very first things you do in our onboarding process, especially if you actually call that out to me. I can go ahead and tell your solution deployment manager, your SDN, the one who walks you through onboarding like weekly helping you do the, you know, set everything else. If I say look especially for Mattie's use case within the no to project. She really needs to have like this is top priority for her.\nNext Steps\nEMILY\n22:06 \nThey will literally put that at the top of the everything is iterative after that? Okay? So they will kind of respect like a lot of times people want to get SSO set up first. Well, typically that's like a week two thing. But if you need it to be a week one, we'll have it be week one, you know?\nNext Steps ends\nEMILY\n22:22 \nSo it's very flexible when it comes to stuff like that to answer your question with a more direct answer like a time answer. I could probably get two groups of people set up in the system with the correct Permissions. If I had like a CSV file… in probably six hours. If I like went head down by myself.\nIntegrations\nMADELINE\n22:48 \nAnd that's like upload. So we would need to provide a list of who needs to have access to each channel.\nEMILY\n22:56 \nDepending on if you want them to register on their own. It all depends on how you want the main system. So CSV is totally possible. If in that, if you provision them in, you could do like an API sync where we could get the data from somewhere, you know, through API calls.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily provided insight on the minimum onboarding package required and described how it can be adapted to accommodate a shorter timeline.

{"prompt":"MADELINE\n23:17 \nWe could.\nEMILY\n23:18 \nDo it that way that's free by the way, we don't charge anything for that or we could hook up to like, do you all have a CRM?

I think that.\nMADELINE\n24:02 \nProbably I can, because I mean, there's so much turnover in healthcare. I don't want to be in charge of the CSV like these new people that run on, they left like, you know, so I think.\nEMILY\n24:13 \nOkay. That's a valid point. Yeah. Yeah. Also, you could totally put a person at your partner organization.\nMADELINE\n24:20 \nPut…\nEMILY\n24:20 \nThat person in charge of it. They can be in charge of their own.\nMADELINE\n24:24 \nAnd then, yeah, yeah.\nEMILY\n24:28 \nYeah, there's flexibility there.

If you'll just keep me posted in terms of time. Like I said, you'll have access, think it was what? 37 days if you need longer than that. Like, I know schedules are insane especially at the end of a quarter. Are you all on the annual, like is March, the end of year Q1?\nNext Steps ends\nMADELINE\n25:02 \nSo, this is so weird because like I was at DocuSign in sales. And now, like they don't I don't know.\nEMILY\n25:10 \nThey don't even, and that's true. If you're not in sales, you might not even.\nMADELINE\n25:15 \nWell, so I'm in sales, but we're tracking like on a monthly, like we have like.\nEMILY\n25:18 \nSo…\nMADELINE\n25:19 \nI don't really know what the system is, which I.\nEMILY\n25:22 \nWell, either, well, either way, just let me know if you need more time, I can get it extended. Honestly, I joke about this, but it's actually true. If I can just prove to my manager that you'll aren't gonna like ghost me and use our trial without like actually being widget, as long as you can prove to me like stay in touch with me and not ghost me then I can extend it for you for probably up to like two months. I probably shouldn't be saying that especially since this call is recorded. But whatever I'll take the.\nMADELINE\n25:52 \nSaying what I've been saying either, but.\nEMILY\n25:54 \nOkay. Well, see her safe with us then.\nMADELINE\n25:57 \nOkay. I appreciate that. Like I said, I know you've been in your shoes on the other side, so I understand it's always so great. When that happens. It is. I don't I feel like you're probably gonna use this but you haven't shared like that with me yet, have you? So I can like log in?\nEMILY\n26:14 \nI have not. So I will send this over to you. I wanted to show it to you. I didn't want you to get a little confused and be like, what the heck is this? I'll send you the credentials to log in, obviously, log in as an admin, maybe first. And if you want to create yourself as a user using like your own email, go and do that. There's links. There's little video things to walk you through. I'll send you like the Google doc. I'll try to send you other resources, anything that I think might be beneficial… but yeah, you can accept that email probably first thing tomorrow because I'm pretty booked up for the rest of the day.\nWrap-Up\nEMILY\n26:48 \nI'll try to get it out today but it might be tomorrow.\nMADELINE\n26:50 \nNo worries. No worries. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thank you. This is awesome. Very helpful.\nEMILY\n26:57 \nGood. Good. Well, it's so good to meet you. I'm glad that like there's other eyes on the project.

Actually set to it's. Like every week, I'm flying, I'm going back, I'm going to Philly this weekend, my wife. Yeah.\nMILAN\n0:29 \nHey, Kevin.\nALEX\n0:29 \nHey, how's it going? Kevin?\nSmall Talk ends\nMILAN\n0:30 \nHey, guys. How's it?\nKEVIN\n0:31 \nGoing nice to meet both of you.\nMILAN\n0:33 \nLikewise…\nALEX\n0:34 \nYeah, absolutely.\nMILAN\n0:35 \nOr joining?\nCASSIE\n0:37 \nHello? Hi, everyone.\nAMANDA\n0:39 \nHey.\nALEX\n0:40 \nHello? Hello?\nCASSIE\n0:48 \nEveryone.\nALEX\n0:50 \nHey, Karina.\nALEX\n0:56 \nCassie, I should say… your soaps are hit over here at the, you might see some purchase or?\nCASSIE\n1:02 \nHey…\nALEX\n1:03 \nOkay.\nCASSIE\n1:05 \nOr I am honored.\nALEX\n1:08 \nI mean, go ahead.\nCASSIE\n1:10 \nI love that. You guys love it. I am about to make more this weekend. So, you know, keep your eye on the website. If you see anything you're like.\nALEX\n1:20 \nWell, I have to get like a, yeah, I…\nKEVIN\n1:23 \nHook up. Maybe, I don't know.\nALEX\n1:25 \nWe can negotiate no, seriously. They're awesome. And great to see everybody on the call. Kevin. Great to meet you. Yeah. So, I thought I'd bring Milan back and go through some of the, you know, admin side of the platform. We didn't get to last time. And then also, Stu is on here. At the end. I thought we'd get, you know, here some feedback on content. If you've looked at anything, I don't know. Has anyone on the team, Karina or Amanda? Have you had a chance to go in at all or take a look at things?\nKARINA\n1:58 \nYeah, I went in and took a look at all the ones that you had? Well, most of them, some were like five hours long. So, I skipped that one, but…\nIntegrations\nALEX\n2:07 \nStu, man. What? No, I'm just kidding. Now, we wanted to give you a little mix. Well, cool. So, you know, I can certainly like get feedback. Were there any thing that you wanted to see in there that you didn't like course titles that you were curious that we didn't put in there that you'd be interested in?\nKARINA\n2:29 \nNo, I think there was a good mix in there. I'm not sure if we'll talk about it today, but I am curious to see like what kind of content is available to choose from. And also curious if there's any sort of content around there, content in there that's around like secure coding and practicing like in python for some, for example, to fix vulnerabilities.\nIntegrations ends\nKARINA\n2:54 \nI'm not sure if that's something you offer, but it did like come up as a question as I was reviewing.\nALEX\n3:01 \nOkay. Why don't, we do this? Like I was gonna budget some time at towards the end to talk through content and maybe even have us to be able to look through some of that stuff while we're on the call.\nIntegrations\nALEX\n3:13 \nSo let's say that towards the end, the beginning I wanted to make sure we got through was all the admin side like… you know, how you put content in the system, how you version content really quickly, you know, just like make sure that we tapped into like how you segment users and auto enrolling people into different paths or compliance paths or content, that sort of thing.\nIntegrations ends\nALEX\n3:37 \nAnd then make sure we answer questions on reporting too. And then we'll touch on some stuff at the end towards content that be good.\nKARINA\n3:47 \nOkay. Yeah, that sounds good. I also wanted to introduce you to Kevin who's on the call. I'm not sure if he's had a chance to introduce himself yet, but he's joined Vimeo as a senior manager on my team. So I wanted to make sure he'll be a stakeholder in this process as well. So wanted to make sure he gets a chance to take a look.\nALEX\n4:08 \nCool. Well, yeah, great to meet you, Kevin. Yeah.\nKEVIN\n4:11 \nYeah, nice to meet all of you as well. Thanks.\nALEX\n4:13 \nOkay. Well, good stuff. I'll let Milan get started and yeah, throw questions in the chat as always. I'll be monitoring it. And then we'll I'll ask questions throughout.\nMILAN\n4:26 \nThanks, Alex. Yeah, as always. Feel free to ask away. We'll jump back into the admin portion here. And before I go ahead and do anything, you know, want to acknowledge? Recognize, welcome, Kevin. You're probably going to be thrown in here a little bit. So why don't to kind of ask the question? What's important to you in this evaluation process? So we can get a sense of some of the things that you might be thinking about and make sure that we're meeting some of your needs as well, that it comes to the table.\nKEVIN\n4:52 \nYeah, I think, you know, I know currently touched on a couple with you around at least, you know, the focus of the specific trainings. But again like the flexibility to kind of, you know, report out of the tool here. I think that's a big thing from our side especially with the tracking. You know, our team spends a lot of cycles being able to just determine, you know, who's completed, what trainings on what frequency. So just kinda the flexibility from that side I think would be helpful to kinda walkthrough. And again, you know, the, you know, the, I guess the different trainings that you guys do offer in there and, you know, how we can mix and match we wanted to. We wanna make sure that we're putting out of training that, you know, it's straight to the point where we're not like, you know, we're not having our staff click through, you know, five and six different I guess modules to kinda, you know, to complete a training. So we wanna make sure it's intuitive for them as well.\nMILAN\n5:38 \nOkay, great. That's really helpful. So hearing that, hearing some of the things that we've been talking about so far, I think some of the directions that we want to go in today, we're step into the central repository, which is a built in content management system that can help you keep track of versioning and get a sense of where different pieces of training material are living from there.\nLayout & Content\nMILAN\n5:59 \nIt will likely make sense to actually step into the back end of a course and show how we can make it easy and intuitive for learners to get a sense of what they have going on but also straightforward for admins to create that and know what their learners are going to experience.\nLayout & Content ends\nMILAN\n6:11 \nAnd then it sounds like it'll make sense to touch on some of the automations in place. So managing users, doing reports and all those kinds of pieces. How does that sound? Is there anything else that folks would like to see that maybe we've been thinking about over the last week since we last chatted or does that sound like a good approach?\nLayout & Content\nMILAN\n6:29 \nOkay. Seeing some nuts. Great. We'll jump into the central repository to kick things off here. And you'll notice me heading over to my admin menu in the top right corner. Again, don't be alarmed by what we're seeing here because we're in a demo site and there's a whole lot going on. But I am signed into our admin profile and I'm able as an administrator to dive in and take a look at all the training material that currently exists in this particular platform. I, you'll notice in the middle, some of those materials that Karina has been testing out. The ones that we served up for a learner.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Milan asked what was important to Kevin in the evaluation process and they discussed trainings, reporting out of the tool, flexibility in mixing/matching different trainings and making sure trainings are straightforward for staff. \n• Milan then proposed diving into the central repository to show how admins can create and keep track of training materials while also exploring the automations in place such as managing users and doing reports. END"}
{"prompt":"MILAN\n14:27 \nSo you get some flexibility in terms of setting some of those expirations as well… to your question, Amanda about blending in different materials. You'll notice that there are a number of tabs up at the top that as we're creating a course, we're going to follow up pretty much in a in or flow. So setting properties comes first introducing training material, managing enrollments and then running any kinds of reports at the course level. You'll notice my training material area is blank though it's telling me to upload something and I can automatically upload those files directly into this course or pull from that same central repository that we were just talking about. So I don't have to go back and forth. I can make use of all the things that might already be in the system… and to blend some training. I'm gonna pull in a Vimeo video that I've actually uploaded. This is kind of a welcome to the table video. But then we're also gonna pull in our, for example fishing score file as well. Really quickly. You'll notice that I have a bunch of different materials at my disposal. I can categorize as these as well and I can search and I can filter to keep things really simple for me. So if I just wanted to find my video, I might come in and grab it that way. Now, I can hit confirm and very quickly both of those files are gonna come in. You'll notice that I have the video and the fishing scorm file from the content marketplace. And with the click of a button, I can see what my learners are going to see. So by in the top right corner, navigating over to my learner view, you'll notice that right away, I can see those two files in there. This learner has actually already viewed this somewhere else in the system, but I can just quickly maybe watch an introductory video or a slide set or something that's going to outline the purpose of this training and then dive into that Professional training right away as well. Hopefully that paints a picture. I mean in the span of a couple of minutes, we were able to create a new course and pull in both training material that we've already had in the system as well as training material that's coming over from a Professional provider.\nMILAN\n16:34 \nDoes that mean some of the sorry go ahead.\nAMANDA\n16:36 \nYeah. I was just gonna ask a question. In the previous window. Was there an option to also add questions? Let's say we wanted to create like our own quiz section, would that be there as well?\nMILAN\n16:47 \nAnd as you'll notice that we can actually navigate right back into the admin side from this learner view by hitting my three buttons, stepping right back into my training material. And then if I choose to add training material, I can build a test right into this view right away with however many questions on whatever topics I want or I can build that test into the central repository and just pull it in here. If I know it's going to be a test I'm using multiple times or a survey that I'm using multiple times.\nAMANDA\n17:14 \nAwesome. Thanks. So.\nALEX\n17:16 \nAnother evaluation, Amanda, I don't know if you would use this for compliance or not. But like your sales teams might for their enablement or even L and D. But another type of test or evaluation is, I mean we have all sorts. I don't know if we even showed all the options with tests, you know, multiple choice text answers like your scale, like we have all those options. We also have an assignment feature. So like, you know, since you are a video company, you could have learners, let's say, test out like maybe a sales person, you know, you're you know, you're a new hire is just needs to test out their elevator pitch on Vimeo. We'll record yourself using Vimeo, upload it to the platform and it gets sent over to a Instructor or their manager to review maybe a three minute video or in a minute long video, whatever you wanna do. And then so that it could be a piece of, it could be a video, it could be a hand out. It could be anything like a piece of content and that goes in and then the Instructor can grade it and send them back a grade along with comments as well. So that's just another way that you can, you know, kind of like give your learners a knowledge check of what they're doing like Milan. And I for example, would have to do that when we got onboarded, we would have to record ourselves giving like a value pitch or something like that. And then it, and then it goes into a manager. I don't know if you would see teams using something like that or not or if your teams would, I thought I would call that out.\nAMANDA\n18:49 \nYeah. Thank you for sharing that. I'm not sure but I mean, it's definitely something that we can get created with at least from the security standpoint. Probably, I'm not sure about sales, but we'd have to confirm, but again, we want our tool to be multi functional and use different teams. So definitely thank you for raising that an option.\nKARINA\n19:09 \nI have a follow up question. So like you mentioned like we can add quizzes or tests as part of this training content. Do we have flexibility to modify quizzes that are already built in to some of the courses that you already offer. So, for example, I think this fishing CPD certified had a few questions in that course. So just wondering if there's flexibility for us to modify some of the quizzes that are in that content?\nIntegrations\nMILAN\n19:41 \nRight from the providers from the content marketplace, correct? Yeah, might pass that over to stew actually to respond because I know there's some opportunities for adaptive type learning and responsive testing and things like that. But stew is probably the best place to answer this question.\nSTU\n19:56 \nYeah. And that is a great question.\nIntegrations ends\nSTU\n19:59 \nEditing the actual learning object isn't something that you'll have the ability to do because these are just off the shelf learning objects. But what you will be able to do as Milan is demonstrated is add any sort of blended learning through a quiz or an assessment built through the Docebo platform. But as far as editing the actual core set, that's not something that we'll be able to do unfortunately.\nKARINA\n20:22 \nGotcha. That makes sense. Thank you.\nMILAN\n20:24 \nYeah. Yeah. That's a great point just to raise is if you find that there is additional comprehension that you're trying to track coming out of some of those trainings, building in a quick two or three question quiz to follow up. That training is a great way to make sure that they're not only going through it but they're also meeting the needs that are more specific to them. You. Yeah.\nALEX\n20:47 \nThis might be a good segway just based off your question, Karina to understand what you can pull and extract out though from out of the box courses. So while you can't edit the actual source files of these out of the box providers, we can report on, you know, what those scoring files, what like what learners are doing in the quizzes, even in those built in scoring files which a lot of LMS can't do is actually extract out that data and visualize it for you in a very, you know, easy to see way.\nUser Permission\nALEX\n21:20 \nSo. And so I don't know if, yeah, if this is kind of if you remember last call we talked about like global reporting for like Power users and admins, they could see all of the courses that their teams were taking and who is enrolled who hadn't started not completed.\nCustom Reports\nALEX\n21:38 \nAnd we could show it a little bit for Kevin too because I don't think he saw it. But this is so that was global reporting. This is course level reporting. So if you really want to get granular and look at like your fishing course and you wanna say, okay here, all the, you know, users, it's not just like did they complete it or not. You also see time spent on course when they last accessed it, their score and I'll let Milan talk to even more granularity you can get. So you can kinda really understand is the scorm course that's out of the box really accomplishing what we need it to and then giving you options to, you know, to look at something else if you need me. But Milan, yeah, I'll take it from here.\nMILAN\n22:21 \nYeah, thanks, Alex. Absolutely all kinds of statistics are available at the back end of any given course including our training material statistics. So what we're seeing here is a high level overview of effectively what pieces of material are resonating with our learners and which pieces of material are people abandoning.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Milan demonstrated multiple options for blending different types of training materials within a course, such as incorporating Vimeo videos and SCORM files.\n• Stu highlighted that editing pre-existing learning objects was not possible, but creating custom quizzes and assessments through the Docebo platform was an option.\n• Alex shared how the platform could provide detailed reporting on courses, such as time spent on the course, scores, etc. to monitor learner engagement. END"}
{"prompt":"MILAN\n30:10 \nWhat would be some of the reminders that you're trying to create? Though? What would be some of those kinds of topics?\nAMANDA\n30:15 \nJust like let's say a week before the deadline?\nMILAN\n30:18 \nYeah.\nAMANDA\n30:20 \nOr three months after the assigned date, they, they're assigned to training, being able to send out automatically because that's been a manual process for us.\nNotifications\nMILAN\n30:28 \nYeah, great. Absolutely. Yeah. So that first example you mentioned is one of the more common use cases, you get to decide on what cadence you want to send those Notifications to let people know that something might be expiring and you get to customize what that time frame is. Yeah.\nCustom Reports\nMILAN\n30:50 \nReporting. And we're gonna step back into the reporting hub that we've been engaging in over the last few conversations just worth mentioning rebuilt cost, prebuilt. Quick summary reports are available off of that. These will have certain visualizations as well. And I think Kevin the courses dashboard is one that will meet some of the needs that you mentioned… as an admin. I can step in and see all the courses that are running in this platform right now. I can see percentage completions by month and I can drill into a specific course to see how that is doing from a compliance perspective. So, for example, starting with the basics again on the left hand side widget here, I'm immediately going to see how many people have completed this course, how many people have not started it, and what percentage is in progress. And then of course, we can always scroll down and see who those individual learners are. Hold this as a PDF or an excel file or even through the left hand side bar filter based on the departments or the organization to get a sense of how specific departments might be doing in that course.\nBranches & Groups\nMILAN\n31:54 \nAnd you'll notice as I go internal here, this is going to be broken out by geographies, but we will dynamically filter that right away to that specific department.\nKARINA\n32:10 \nSorry, I may have missed this, but are we able to add additional fields into this report?\nMILAN\n32:16 \nThese ones are costs are prebuilt?\nCustom Reports\nKARINA\n32:19 \nOkay.\nMILAN\n32:19 \nBut that's where the custom reports come into play. So take care… under our custom reports builder, this is where you can slice and dice things as much as you want. We happen to have a full course report in here already as an example. But to highlight for you, Karina reports on users and the courses that are in reporting, on overdue courses, running reports on groups and Branches. All these associations are prebuilt for you with their own associated custom additional fields. And just to visualize what that looks like as I dive into the full course report and I take a look at my options, this is where I get to decide what kind of information I'm trying to serve up in report… could be information about learners, information about courses as well as information about learners interacting with courses. So the number of actions they took time spent in session, maybe a final score and you can configure these in whatever column order you want, and even schedule them to be emailed out to an email Inbox on a specific cadence.\nBranches & Groups\nKARINA\n33:22 \nPerfect. Thank you.\nMILAN\n33:23 \nYou're. Welcome.\nALEX\n33:28 \nSo, there's additional fields with the reports. There's also additional fields with how you group together learners as well. So we kinda touch on it, but I just wanna, you know, make that clear is that if you have a specific way you like to group, like maybe you wanna add a field like, hey, I don't know Vimeo summer learning Cohort or, you know, security, you know, leadership manager, you know, manager leadership training Cohort, right? That could be a, that could be a field. You know, any like a field could be like, yeah, what is their role or their… department? Or like we have a lot of standard ones, but you can create your own custom ones. I don't know if there's certain custom things that you like to group people at in the Vimeo, but I could be like your or maybe it's a employee resource network group that you want to deliver training too, and I training for example… but you have that ability as well.\nBranches & Groups ends\nMILAN\n34:33 \nI think that covers off much of what we wanted to share from an admin perspective that came up as important. I believe we've also touched on some of the other things that were named today. Is there anything else that's kind of important from a workflow perspective or in terms of making a decision that we haven't touched on yet? We can do now?\nLayout & Content\nAMANDA\n34:52 \nQuestion. Is there a way to move around like different modules on the home dashboard just to make like friendly to the? I felt like when I was on the learner side, it seemed like a lot and to like organize it more if possible.\nMILAN\n35:07 \nYeah. Let's step into our page editor to that point and let's actually step into that learner homepage.\nLayout & Content ends\nMILAN\n35:12 \nSo under our admin menu, again, we're going to scroll down to our managed pages section and dive into the learner homepage, which is called Vimeo home. If you've ever worked with like or square space, what I'm about to share is going to be fairly familiar. But just as a reminder, this was at that homepage preview, this is kind of what the learner saw. Amanda. What would you delete? What do we want to get rid of?\nAMANDA\n35:38 \nSo like scrolling down… just like all these videos being able to categorize them by let's say, creating a security awareness section where you going back up where the little boxes were being able to change the names or move that around or just being able to customize that more? Yeah, basically.\nMILAN\n36:00 \nYeah, great. So let me show you what that looks like from a page at your perspective. These are all different images, custom content boxes down here. As we scroll further down, these are catalogs and channels. When I click over, you're gonna see that broken out by those different items that we saw.\nLayout & Content\nMILAN\n36:17 \nSo I know that these three custom content boxes. Maybe I want to go ahead and edit and I can quickly step in, change my background color. Maybe I want to call this something entirely different. You know, maybe it's not my courses and certifications, maybe it's going to be my transcript or what have you? So these custom content boxes that you completely decide the look and feel and even upload images as a background if you want to. I can say, hey, I'm actually gonna just delete three images here because I don't really want to show these to my learner. I don't think that they're important.\nLayout & Content ends\nMILAN\n36:49 \nAnd instead, I'm going to stack some of these boxes, for example, right? I'm gonna take this one and then stack this third one as well. And you'll notice that change is going to be affected the moment that I save it. But I can quickly preview to get a sense of how that's going to look for my learner. So just quickly been able to move that over that's going to be affected automatically. I can then drag up my catalogs, move things around as I see fit. And you have something like 20 widgets available to you as I come back to the composer to do whatever you want with. You may choose to visualize activity overviews, bringing catalogs from a compliance perspective. Something that we often see popular is giving learners a calendar which is going to show upcoming deadlines or Instructor like training and even force is in an Agenda mode. So they effectively have a line by line itinerary of everything that's coming up for them that month.\nLayout & Content\nMILAN\n37:46 \nYou notice a number of other ones, the opportunities to share content, maybe even something like bringing in a quick task list so that we can share for this learner. What kind of deadlines do you have coming up and what courses have you not yet started? And I can just again quickly add a widget jump over to my desktop review. This is not the order that I would like we structure things in but for the purposes of demo showing how quickly it is to move stuff around and even bring in a totally new look and feel.\nAMANDA\n38:16 \nYeah, this is very cool. What was that gamification widget that you had scrolled through?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Milan provided reminders for sending notifications with a customizable time frame;\n• Milan introduced the pre-built cost Quick Summary reports which offer certain visualizations, and enable admins to get an overview of course performance from a compliance perspective;\n• Karina asked whether additional fields could be added to reports, to which Milan responded that custom reports allow for slicing and dicing data according to user preference;\n• Alex mentioned that there are additional fields available for grouping learners together, including custom ones;\n• Amanda inquired about moving around modules on the home dashboard and organizing them, prompting a demonstration of editing custom content boxes, catalogs, channels, activity overviews, Instructor-led training agendas and quick task lists. END"}
{"prompt":"MILAN\n38:22 \nLet me bring it up for you. The gamification widget is something that can visualize the badges that our learner has achieved so far points that they may be collected and any leader boards that they're competing in. So maybe less from a security and compliance perspective, but absolutely something that we see people make use of for kind of building the early stages of a learning culture often, but also just making it engaging and exciting. So, this widget as I jump over to our preview will let our learn to see what kind of badges they have so far, any points that they might want to make use of in their reward shop, and also any leader boards that they're competing in and what they're kind of progresses on those leader boards?\nAMANDA\n39:02 \nNice. Thank you.\nALEX\n39:06 \nI should say like the page editor is very much, I mean, there's no code required. It's you know, you don't have to have tons of computer skills to create these. You can create as many pages as you want. So we visualized a few for you.\nLayout & Content\nALEX\n39:19 \nSo everything that you saw like the admin page is a widget is a widget based page. The onboarding, the new hire page is a widget based page, right? Like to your point, if you just wanna make something very simple for new hires, maybe you don't want to offer all that stuff that we did on that homepage.\nLearning Plans\nALEX\n39:37 \nMaybe you're gonna go to an onboarding page and it's all it says is in progress, not started completed. And then once somebody completes that, yeah. So this page we created for you, just simple, easy to kind of visualize, right? Once someone completes everything in this, then they, it will trigger them to be in a new group.\nLearning Plans ends\nALEX\n39:56 \nAnd then they're no longer a new hire. They are a full time employee or however you want to categorize them. And then when they log in, the next thing, they see instead of seeing this page, they see the other, you know, full time page for their role. It could be for, you know, maybe everyone sees a global page where you wanna make another page for sales or like, you know, maybe you wanna make a page for other designers. You can make multiple pages and you can assign who sees what based on who they are in the company.\nIntegrations\nAMANDA\n40:35 \nSounds good. Yeah, it appears to be very user friendly, which is something that like, I know you probably don't offer this, but is there a feature for fishing campaigns to host through the site? Considering you also have security awareness content?\nALEX\n40:52 \nTo, to clarify that, you know, fishing campaign.\nNotifications\nALEX\n40:55 \nSo like a user takes a course and there's maybe a test, they get sent emails that might be fishing related or like unsafe emails and you're kind of testing to see if they go and click in and apply. Is that sort of like a penetration test kind of?\nNotifications ends\nAMANDA\n41:10 \nYeah, that's correct. And mainly, I asked this because, you know, our previous tool that we use now for security awareness has that built in feature where we use on an annual basis. So I was just wondering if that was here available?\nALEX\n41:23 \nYeah. So let's do talk a little bit to some of our providers that offer those types of penetration tests, but the answer is, yes, we do how's that type of like that type of content in? So people would, you wouldn't have to the great part about it is the person wouldn't have to like leave the system and take the training or take that type of test in another platform. They could take that course or that test from within Docebo. So, I don't know if you want to talk to, you know, how that looks with the providers that we?\nIntegrations\nSTU\n41:59 \nYeah. Yeah. That, that's a great question. Amanda, we do have a couple of providers that we can do fishing simulators through. The main one that folks leverage is a provider called inspired E learning. So that is something that we can help deliver. It will all be done through the Docebo platform. Keeping in mind that is a small incremental additional cost. On top of just the traditional premium content library. Is that additional fishing simulator that we can do through them? So I'm happy to provide some resources on what that looks like kind of a one sheet on that provider.\nWrap-Up\nSTU\n42:38 \nAnd I'm sure that, you know, Alex and Milan can help kinda demonstrate what that would actually look like through Docebo?\nAMANDA\n42:44 \nYeah. We'd love to learn more about it if you can share the docs for it or anything that would be cool. Thank you.\nSTU\n42:49 \nYeah, glad.\nAMANDA\n42:50 \nI asked the question because I wasn't sure at first.\nALEX\n42:54 \nWe want curve balls to, I mean, we're not just saying yes, we can do everything. We want you to try to stump us, but that's a good question. So keep on, you know, bringing them our way. Well, cool. You know, we got through a lot today. I did wanna leave like Stu some time. I know, you know, Karina you had a few questions related to content, maybe that would be a good time to kind of ask that. And, you know, if we need to see, you know, put anything more in here to help you feel confident about what we are putting in there.\nIntegrations\nALEX\n43:28 \nSo like the content selection is so vast, so we could review content for hours and still not see at all. But we wanna focus on what's you know, most important to is the guy to really talk to about.\nMILAN\n43:41 \nYeah.\nALEX\n43:41 \nNow we're you know, what you're really looking for? Yeah.\nSTU\n43:46 \nYeah, Karina. I don't know if you want to kick it off. I know that you had a question around like what types of content we have available. And then also, I think you mentioned secure coding with python, but we'd love to kind of get your feedback on what you've taken so far and what you're hoping to see more of.\nKARINA\n44:02 \nYeah, I'm just more, so curious like what kind of content you already have available for us to pick from? Like, are we looking at 10 courses, 100 courses, a 1,000 courses? Just getting that general idea would be helpful. And also from like a topic perspective, I'm not sure if there's like an easy way to see what kinds of topics you already have available in the course library or the repository that's also something I'm looking for as well. And just like a general idea of how long each of those courses take because those are super important as like if we were to move forward to be able to see like how many courses fall within the time frame that we're hoping to deliver at. So, yeah, if you can walk us through that would be helpful.\nSTU\n44:54 \nYeah. So as far as what the general library has is today, it's about 70,000 learning objects. So it is quite vast but to your point, not everything is gonna fall within the modality that it sounds like you want to deliver the training content in sounds like bite size short form is going to be best fit for you. Potentially, what I am happy to do is provide you sort of a more comprehensive list of the different sub topics and skills that all of this content maps to so that you can have a better idea of what will be at your disposal from the content library. I don't know if that would be helpful. And then are there like specific skills or topics that are like super top of mind for you so that I can surface the most relevant stuff to the top?\nKARINA\n45:42 \nYeah. I think it'll be the ones that Amanda sent over through email. Those are the high security awareness related topics, but there may be others as like we move through the year for example. If there are any like security incidents that are occurring like more often than others, if there's a topic that's related to that we would love to surface it. So it's hard to say since it is dynamic. But the ones that Amanda shared would be most top of mind.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Milan provided a demonstration of Docebo's gamification features, including visualizing badges, points, and leader boards.\n• Alex explained the user-friendly page editor, demonstrating how users can create multiple pages with varied content.\n• Alex and Milan discussed integrating course content and tests into Docebo.\n• Stu highlighted a provider offering a fishing simulation feature and suggested Karina request further information related to content availability. END"}
{"prompt":"STU\n46:12 \nGot it. And I'm happy to kind of build another collection or, you know, playlist that we can have Milan put into your demo instance so that Amanda and team can actually go in and just see the coverage that we have for that specific security awareness track along with the fishing simulation and what we discussed earlier. And so as far as next steps, happy to give you guys insight into not only the broader coverage that you'll have with the library. But then some of these specifics that are really top of mind here in the short term.\nKARINA\n46:46 \nOkay. Yeah, that'll be helpful. And I'm not sure if there's like a demo instance for the admin side.\nUser Permission\nKARINA\n46:53 \nI think what was shared with us was more the user end of things. So if you can also have some visibility into the admin side that'll be super helpful as well.\nALEX\n47:04 \nYeah, I can follow up after this call with like with a log on to the admin side arena.\nLayout & Content\nALEX\n47:11 \nAnd if there was like specific parts you needed us to walkthrough let me know, but you'll have a demo recording of this as well to help you?\nKARINA\n47:22 \nOkay, perfect. Let me see what else? I assume this is because what we were playing around with is the demo site, but I did notice some of the training was a little slow like from an activity standpoint.\nMobile App\nKARINA\n47:42 \nHas any of your customers raised that as a concern or is that mainly attributed to the fact that this was a demo instance?\nALEX\n47:51 \nI would say like definitely let us know like I want to troubleshoot it on our end or test it to see what exactly the file is, and if it's a file issue or if it's you know, if it's internet issue or connectivity, you know, all that.\nMobile App ends\nALEX\n48:07 \nI mean, you know, we run on Aws, so it's a, it is a very fast platform, you know, just to navigate and to upload content and to get through. But yeah, if you found something please, yeah, I can, I'd like to, you know, figure out what that file was and what you were looking at. So I can give you a good answer to see to troubleshoot it with. If that, if that's good because, yeah, it's not like something I've heard of as like a widespread issue or anything like that.\nMILAN\n48:34 \nYeah.\nKARINA\n48:34 \nOkay.\nMILAN\n48:35 \nYeah, I have, I was just gonna say I haven't run into that. Often the demo sites are spun up on a different set of resources than your actual site is for obvious reasons you might expect. But please, yeah, definitely. Let us know which ones those are. So we can take a look on our end because we don't often hear that. So it's something for us to explore.\nKARINA\n48:55 \nYeah, I think it was a few courses that had this issue, not everything. So I can take a look and like let you know which ones those were.\nALEX\n49:06 \nAll… right. Okay. So next steps, you know, I guess Stu, you'll put together something for Karina, you wanted just to confirm Karina?\nIntegrations\nALEX\n49:19 \nDid you wanted us like to give just a list or numbers and key areas or how would you know, like to see what? You know, we have to be able to feel comfortable knowing we have the breadth and depth of content that you need.\nKARINA\n49:36 \nYeah. Like whether it's a list or like you indicating like how we can get to that page within the demo instance. I guess I'll leave that up to you since you know your platform best, but I would love to be able to see like there's like 100 courses within the security awareness topic that is like kind of like cartoon animation style that's that can be delivered within 10, 15 minutes at each course level. That's kind of what I'm hoping to see. So whatever format that you feel is easiest to share that in I'm flexible.\nALEX\n50:19 \nYeah. And we can absolutely do that, and maybe we can upload some more on like the python courses as well. And so can find some, you know, maybe some animation courses as well. That might be good.\nIntegrations ends\nKARINA\n50:29 \nYeah. And that's not like super critical for us. Like if there is no option to do like coding practice within the platform, but it would be a huge plus if there is, since we have another tool that we use right now that offers that exact capability. But if we can consolidate everything into one platform, it'll be easier for everyone involved. So just curious if that was an option.\nIntegrations\nSTU\n50:56 \nIs that specifically like lab environments that you're looking to have access to?\nKARINA\n51:00 \nYes.\nSTU\n51:01 \nOkay. Yeah. This is all really helpful to understand. And so I can work with Alex and Milan just to figure out the best way to deliver your asks around content availability, but then also make some specific recommendations around how we might be able to, you know, displace or supplement some of the things that the technical folks are doing with, you know, python and coding and whatnot?\nCoach & Share\nKARINA\n51:25 \nOkay. Yeah, that'll be great. And if it is something that you have available there's another team in Vimeo that we'd like to share this with. So just keep us posted and we can circulate internally.\nSTU\n51:39 \nPerfect. And we're always happy to have calls with any sort of subject matter experts internally that would take interest in this.\nCoach & Share ends\nKARINA\n51:46 \nOkay. Perfect.\nALEX\n51:50 \nAll right, cool. Well, thanks. You know, it sounds like, you know, we hit on some key points. There was a lot of like positive things that everyone liked about the platform. Maybe just a quick go around like with everyone. If I could like what were things that really stuck out to you from the admin side versus what you have. We don't I don't believe you have something today. So maybe on what the process is today? What if I will go to Cassie? I'm just looking right here below me.\nCASSIE\n52:20 \nPerfect. I like that you can see when the drop off is for when people are completing courses because I think that, that's good as a non for us in instructional designing of like what is the barrier of entry here?\nCustom Reports\nCASSIE\n52:35 \nSo I just like that you can track that and see the percentage completion versus in progress. And when the people ask access the platform. So I just like how creepy you can be in the.\nALEX\n52:49 \nOn, on the low on the download. Yeah, for sure. Amanda, what about you?\nCustom Reports ends\nAMANDA\n52:57 \nYeah, I really like the reporting aspect of it and how customized you can make the reports. I think that's something that our team needs just to be able to prove our KPI'S and, or, and prove that we're meeting goals really. And also just like the ease of use from an admin perspective, like it's very easy to use from a UI perspective.\nIntegrations\nAMANDA\n53:16 \nLike you don't really need to know how to code or anything like that. But yeah, what I'm really looking forward to seeing is the content. So I look forward to that list and then being able to play around with that.\nALEX\n53:28 \nWere there any providers that like you were high on right now? I don't know if I've asked that question, like right now, you have a couple right? That the organization is using?\nAMANDA\n53:39 \nFor an LMS?\nALEX\n53:41 \nWere like, yeah, learning like out of the box content providers you have right now, what are the like if we could just remember, remind me those like what you're where you're getting content from compliance?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Stu offered to put together a collection of playlists to demonstrate the security awareness track and broader coverage in the library.\n• Karina asked if there was a demo instance for the admin side.\n• Alex offered to troubleshoot any issues with file, internet, or connectivity and run on AWS platform which is fast for uploading content.\n• Milan suggested spinning up the demo site on different resources than and asked Karina to specify courses with slow activity.\n• Karina wanted cartoon animation style courses that could be delivered within 10-15 mins.\n• Alex offered additional python courses and animation courses as well as access to lab environment and ability to customize reports.\n• Amanda looked forward to seeing the content list and ease of use from an admin perspective as well as reporting aspect for proofing KPIs. END"}
{"prompt":"AMANDA\n53:54 \nYeah. So for security awareness, we were using curricula, our mandatory security awareness training, company wide. And then we also have a Mercer labs which is the developer training for all engineers and developers of the company. And then we have another site which is where we create our own content, our own videos, our own quizzes, things like that and that's Influitive. And that's like a gamified platform.\nALEX\n54:18 \nYeah. Okay, cool.\nMILAN\n54:25 \nMy partner used to work at Influitive. I haven't heard that name in a number of that's very good.\nALEX\n54:30 \nOur, one of our marketing guys just went to Influitive as well. Cool. All right. So, yeah, so big on. Yeah, just the breadth of content and reporting. Karina, you gave us a couple a bunch of feedback. Anything else that you'd add that kinda stuck out to you?\nKARINA\n54:54 \nI definitely echo what Cassie and Amanda have said so far. I'm a huge fan of the reporting aspect because that's not something we have right now. So that in itself is a huge plus and just the flexibility that you offer in terms of like what kind of data to extract is super cool. So that's the part I really like.\nIntegrations\nALEX\n55:16 \nOn extracting data or do you have like a BI tool internally that Vimeo uses like a PowerBI, or Looker or something like that or snowflake?\nKARINA\n55:26 \nWe do, yeah, everything you said we.\nALEX\n55:29 \nReally?\nKARINA\n55:30 \nYep.\nALEX\n55:31 \nWow. That could be really interesting. I wouldn't really bring it up now but like if extracting data just, I mean, if it's a huge win, just or out of the box reporting like that's, I'm always like the path of least in let's start there before we run or, you know, run a mile or marathon, but eventually as you scale and grow or really wanna get deep into kind of data visualization. And, you know, learning intelligence, we actually just launched the tool to be able to actually export data from Docebo clean it up and then put it into your business intelligence tool, like using you using snowflake. So being able to put it into, you know, your BI tool. And a lot of times teams don't have access to that BI tool or it's managed by different data analyst wing of the company. But this could help you visualize that in a more seamless way. And that's all I know without being super techy and putting my, one of these solutions architect had on. But yeah. So it's a way to kind of extract out the data from Docebo. Clean it up and visualize it in your own tool like outside of Docebo, if that's of interest.\nIntegrations ends\nKARINA\n56:47 \nGotcha. That's pretty cool. I don't know if we're Vimeo as a company is ready for that this year to be honest, but.\nALEX\n56:54 \nYeah. So.\nKARINA\n56:54 \nWe can explore down the line.\nALEX\n56:55 \nAnd we can follow…\nMILAN\n56:56 \nThe crawl walk run and that.\nALEX\n56:58 \nLet's absolutely do that. Yeah.\nMILAN\n57:00 \nYeah, I think it's nice to know that it's something that's there that you can grow into and that they can continue to kind of meet those needs as they evolve rather than having to jump to another platform in two years or three years, should you outgrow needs, right? I think that's one of the things that you won't find with the table growing what we can offer.\nKARINA\n57:17 \nYep.\nALEX\n57:21 \nWell, cool. Let us get some of this stuff back. I'll kinda debrief with row. I think we have another call to with the like the HR, our VP of HR to kind of bring her up to speed on things. And then, yeah, I think from there, we're kind of meeting with your procurement team.\nWrap-Up\nALEX\n57:37 \nSo if there's anything more, I'll also give you the admin access, Karina. I'll send you a recording of this… might be tomorrow morning if just to get the recording to render and everything. But you'll get that along with access to get into the platform and you'll see some follow ups… from us on content as well.\nKARINA\n57:58 \nOkay, perfect. If you can also include Amanda on that, that'll be great.\nALEX\n58:01 \nYeah, yeah, I'll include everybody just so you're on the Loop.\nKARINA\n58:06 \nPerfect.\nALEX\n58:08 \nCool. Alright.

{"prompt":"RICK\n0:00 \nOkay, Andy, before we kick off, let me just give you a little bit of introduction, a little bit of context around Docebo and what we do, I'm sure you've you probably know most of it. Let me just sort of summarize from a 30,000 foot view and I'll just spend Mallory, I promise, I'll spend two minutes doing that.\nAbout Docebo\nRICK\n0:16 \nSo Docebo, we've been around for, since 2005. We listen on the Toronto stock exchange and on nasa and we're proudly still found a lead. So all this time later, we still found a lead which is terrific. And we service over 3,000, 300 customers around the world, over 70 countries.\nAbout Docebo ends\nRICK\n0:37 \nWe deal with organizations such as yours on a daily basis. We're very proud to provide learning outcomes, you know, to your industry and many others as well. Unlike other providers we specialize in learning. So we're recognized as a best in cut, best in class learning development training, enablement platform. We're not an HRIS that does a whole range of things and a slider or a module of learning. We specialize in learning. Okay, we also have a complete suite of learning products. So it's important for a lot of organizations as part of their learning strategy training, enablement development strategy to have to partner with organization that they can evolve and grow with.\nAbout Docebo\nRICK\n1:18 \nOkay. So we have about 12 learning modules that we can offer and provide our customers as their learning, you know, strategy evolves and as those requirements, you know, come to the four. So once you get in terms of scalability, growing and evolving with the learning partner, we do that exceptionally well, wise learning important what we try and do and is take away the technology and the com plexity for learning.\nLayout & Content\nRICK\n1:45 \nOkay? A learner, a user, a truck driver, or operator, or technician. Yeah, in order to enable train them, the technology shouldn't get the way. So we really personalize that learner experience to make sure it's simplistic, it's clean, it's intuitive and it's easy to access. Okay? And we obviously have a very personalized landing page and learning experience for them.\nLayout & Content ends\nRICK\n2:11 \nWe find that if we, if we do that and the importance around that and is it will increase a number of things all attached to or, I, user adoption engagement and completion, which is really important for us and that's a really key measure for us as well. I think in the core context, there is three key areas that we're looking at today is, and in no particular, let's start with the internal Audience. We wanna make sure that the internal users and staff and the learners within core have a really solid platform to help them achieve their learning outcomes. There be succession enablement up scaling, you know, compliance certifications and so on and so forth. Or say your external stakeholders, you mentioned capaleto sports and others, it's around enabling those partners as external stakeholders where they'd be technicians, drivers, operators to achieve those training and enablement outcomes that you've so eloquently outlined in your opening discussion. And for me, this is the most exciting part. It's the industry wide concept. I love this. Roger did mention this previously and it really resonated with me. We would like to help core establish themselves through this learning platform through this experience as the thought leader. Okay, you know, and along with that comes an opportunity for eCommerce that is revenue generation selling courses and so on and so forth.\nAbout Docebo\nRICK\n3:38 \nSo, I know that looks like a pipe train that might be a long way away. But I think with this type of solution and what we've seen other customers do it's probably a lot closer than you think.\nANDYKIMPTON\n3:51 \nYeah. I think it's not that far away is that we've been playing in the shallow end of the pool for a long time with what we've got with the code take solution on, you know, the digital solution partner solution now, but very much so is that the board which we've got meeting tomorrow and I'm which this may be really timely because I'm reporting on our progress to the board and we are founder, let as well. The founder of core still is. And so, you know, he and Marcus, his business partner we came in 2016 would be very keen on maximizing the capability of the core academy and how that plays out not only internally but externally as well. So that comes.\nRICK\n4:43 \nWonderful. Thank you.\nAbout Docebo ends\nRICK\n4:45 \nI'll pass over to Mallory shortly and Mallory as I always say Roger, Andy, please, this is the collaborative session. We encourage you to ask questions. We encourage your interruptions and we encourage you to pause us and ask us to, you know, sort of explain… or back track as needed. This is a session that we've developed for you. So please, anything you need, please let us know with that, any further due mail I'll hand over to you?\nMALLORY\n5:11 \nThank you. Thank you and Andy, really nice to meet you, Roger. Thanks for organizing this for us to be able to connect together today.\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n5:20 \nI, I'm gonna ask a question. We and Roger knows we, we've gone through this with him before. We usually try and show a few different perspectives of the platform including the administrator. But I'm not sure if you wanted to maybe focus a bit of extra time on the learner experience. And so I can also try and accommodate that. And then…\nLayout & Content ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n5:40 \nI'll be right man. I mean to Roger.\nMALLORY\n5:44 \nI thought so, I thought so, I thought so. So let's definitely dig in and spend a good amount of time then on the learner experience because that's really.\nANDYKIMPTON\n5:51 \nThe things I guess from your perspective is what, how we're going to manage it because we're building out a balanced scorecard. And the fourth quadrant of that balanced scorecard is the learning Growth perspective. And that's about capability people. We've got the employee value proposition, the skills acquisition, motivation, reward recognition, and then the knowledge management of that, which creates the core culture. And I'm happy we're still building it out. But each one of those will have initiatives. Each of the pillars in the four quadrants of the balanced scorecard, will have initiatives like this to actually satisfy. And then we can measure it as well.\nMALLORY\n6:32 \nGreat. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll definitely try to align the discussion to that as well then. So you said it was knowledge management, skill management.\nPricing\nANDYKIMPTON\n6:42 \nThe value composition for an employee, they come into the call knowing that, you know, the onboarding creates that environment that they understand what core is, what our product is, what our product knowledge is, and how they go through that JF learning and a very complex industry because most, you know, 95 percent of people have been here less than five years, 76, less than 256, less than one.\nPricing ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n7:09 \nSo think about where the, our Growth strategy at Growth trajectory is like this and our capability trajectory is probably that. So we go through that delta in knowledge and understanding and competency and capability. So that Growth trajectory doesn't track down towards our capability. We push out capability that pushes that Growth trajectory upward.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Board members and the founders are keen to maximize the capabilities of Core Academy.\n• Andy plans to introduce initiatives through a scorecard tool in order to measure knowledge, skills, value and motivation of employees.

{"prompt":"MALLORY\n7:33 \nOf course, you have to leverage those experts in your organization to make sure that retention the knowledge is handed down across and also engaging these new learners. And, you know, people straight out of school, how can you get them to come in while you have these experts in your organization?\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n7:50 \nYou have to leverage that and how can you do that? And we'll definitely show you through the platform how that's possible. Okay. So I'm gonna share my screen. Just give me one second… now. Okay. You can see my screen? Okay. Yeah, perfect. All right. So one thing that you'll see is very prominent with the platform. It's something that we pride ourselves on is the flexibility. So, just like Rick said, the technology really is invisible. It's not Docebo. You're speaking to your learners from core and you're able to really adjust depending on the learner Audience and personalize that. So obviously the vision we have in mind was what we created with our conversations with rodge and really understanding the organization.\nLayout & Content ends\nMALLORY\n8:40 \nBut the idea is that you will have the keys and the tools to be able to recreate exactly the vision that you have in mind for both your internal employees as well as the academy and your customers, and up and coming students in the wider industry. So this as an example could be a sign on page that you would have visible to your employees. So it, you know, has… your factory warehouse. I'm not sure if that's the right?\nAbout Docebo\nANDYKIMPTON\n9:08 \nThat operations and engineering send an E.\nMALLORY\n9:12 \nBeautiful operations and engineering centre?\nANDYKIMPTON\n9:15 \nThey… more.\nMALLORY\n9:20 \nBeautiful. Great. And then maybe you'll have something a little bit different for your customers that are coming in, you know, a little bit more marketing and you can personalize that your marketing team will be very happy about that.\nPayment Gateway\nMALLORY\n9:34 \nWe do also allow for single sign on as well. And you can also have an external facing catalog page where you're able to actually sell courses and subscription bundles and plans. And I know that obviously eCommerce is something that you'll think about in the future, but you can also have that available as well.\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n9:51 \nNow, in terms of logging in, I'll actually just log in here as actually now we'll go here, we'll go as a customer.\nMALLORY\n10:03 \nSo a customer will log in and they'll be greeted with a page. These are 100 percent customizable. So we've obviously browsed your and this has actually picked up the employee training apologies. So this will be your customer landing. So we've browse your website, pulled some images especially around your caplato machinery. I know that's a very important product that you have available. So the learner will be actually come in here and be greeted with an experience that is personalized to them. And you can create as many of these as you want. And utilizing drag and drop widgets with absolutely no code or no design requirements. You're able to recreate these pages specific to the learner needs. And so you're really going to be able to drive the information that you need to the right learner Audience.\nLayout & Content ends\nMALLORY\n10:56 \nMaybe you have a specific group that is targeting… the combined work that you're doing with the GTO, around this trainee ship, getting people through industrial services training. You might have a specific page for them. Then you might have one for someone who's purchased or least a truck. So you'll have a specific page for them.\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n11:17 \nAnd so that will really drive adoption because they'll be engaged with the content that they're receiving on their personalized page. But as an example, some of the widgets that you will be able to recreate on these different experiences are, you know, you can have videos, you can have images, you can include gamification as part of the platform to really drive that, kick start that adoption and get people excited about being in the platform. This works very well for the younger Audience because everything's gamified. So if you can include that as part of your learning program and launches, then that will definitely kick start that adoption. For sure. You can include widgets that will have information about where the learner is in terms of their progress.\nLearning Plans\nMALLORY\n11:57 \nYou can even, I frame content in or HTML content in. It is a very flexible and the design is 100 percent up to you. They'll be able to come in here. They'll be able to see a learning plan for example. So they might want to have a learner, you might want to have a learning plan assigned to industrial backing equipment.\nLearning Plans ends\nMALLORY\n12:17 \nYou might have a community available and so easily, they can identify where they need to go for that training and where they can access that community help from whether it be your staff or other people within the industry. So I'm just gonna pause there for a second. And I'd love to get your initial thought.\nANDYKIMPTON\n12:33 \nThis is fantastic. I'm not sure if there's something that I could actually ping to the, at the board meeting in 15 minutes on the academy tomorrow with Roger. I can get a log in or something like that to show this sort of stuff on Power, how is advancing and how especially around the eCommerce capability of it as well, which is they're very keen about?\nMALLORY\n13:01 \nYeah. Okay. We can definitely do that. Yeah.\nRICK\n13:04 \nJust as a suggestion, Andy, we are more than happy to participate and maybe jump in for five or 10, 15 minutes and showcase this with you and the board just, you know, really 15 minutes snapshot share this experience with the board and then jump off if that's going to be a value to you, we're more than happy to accommodate.\nANDYKIMPTON\n13:26 \nAll right. We've got a pretty full Agenda tomorrow, but if it's not this meeting, we might make it the April one but then it might not it further. But this is great that we're working towards it. So we'll see how it goes.\nMALLORY\n13:42 \nI can actually record a short video if you like. And then you could show that tomorrow in the meeting, just a five minute video if you like.\nANDYKIMPTON\n13:49 \nYou know, even if it's just a couple of minutes or five would be fantastic… because I can see just then the rest of the Agenda just going.\nMALLORY\n14:01 \nYeah.\nANDYKIMPTON\n14:02 \nYeah, I.\nMALLORY\n14:03 \nOkay. I can send you a short two minute video just briefly showing sort of what we've shown today.\nOnboarding\nMALLORY\n14:09 \nAnd yeah, perfect. Excellent. All right. Of course, we, whatever we can do to support and make sure that, you know, the key team that's going to be, you know, handling this project outside of yourselves are also on board and they understand that solution will fit your requirements. We wanna make sure everyone's comfortable with that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Andy asked if there was anything he could bring to the board meeting to present.\n• They will send a recording a short video to showcase at the board meeting. \n END"}
{"prompt":"ANDYKIMPTON\n14:31 \nYou know, I'm all about partnering. This is not a master server relationship. I'm all about partnering with all of our vendors and we're basically turning back the last couple of years because we're very much been the driver of that. But, you know, we don't know everything and we're not saying we do. And the really important thing is us to get really key partners involved in our business and live and breathe it and everything else that goes. I'm sure we can get you out to mount Drew at some stage. So you can actually, you know, have a touch and feel of that. And we've got something in the we're going to actually have an open day in the Ein the coming weeks as well. So you might want to jump, you know, if there's any other video stuff we can made marketing digital marketing person and also help with that. So that'll be great.\nMALLORY\n15:26 \nYeah, definitely. I mean, I, I'd love that would be great. So Roger make sure you pass me the information of that and I'll see if I can fit in my schedule and hit out there and have a look that'll be awesome.\nANDYKIMPTON\n15:39 \nI did watch the demonstration.\nRICK\n15:41 \nDo…\nANDYKIMPTON\n15:42 \nGo on.\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n15:43 \nWhat, what's this one that you had in Victoria? And?\nANDYKIMPTON\n15:46 \nThat was?\nMALLORY\n15:47 \nYeah, that look great. So, awesome. Fabulous. Okay. So in terms of I'll quickly run through what, you know, course work might look like for a learner, it's very clean. Simple. Easy. You can create different learning plans.\nLearning Plans\nMALLORY\n16:03 \nSo it really guides them into different content, E learning. You can do workshops, a combination of webinars, face to face, whatever it is that you require. And then the actual course player itself is very simple and clean. So you'll be able to see here the course player and you can have the playlist of the content that they're going to consume.\nLearning Plans ends\nMALLORY\n16:22 \nAnd you can even make it simpler if you wanted to and just have that course player available to them. And then as part of that course training, you can provide, you know, maybe additional files that are part of the training, but they supplement things like product manuals or, you know, process documents or safety law, white papers and things like that.\nCoach & Share\nMALLORY\n16:44 \nAnd then you can have questions and answers available as part of the platform as well. So they can have that conversation and engage with their peers and have that wider discussion around what the, what is this equipment use for best practices? And things like that. They can start that conversation in a course itself.\nCoach & Share ends\nMALLORY\n17:02 \nBut we definitely have a wider community within the platform as well. We're agnostic to material. So you can add any training material that you need, you know, PPTS videos, scoring packages, X a P is you can even I frame from external websites into the player as well. And we have multiple different evaluation tools. So you can actually have the learner upload a file or record a video on their phone and have that uploaded for an assessment. So maybe they want, you need, they need to show how they're turning on a particular piece of machinery, being safe, they can actually record themselves doing that. There's tests available within the platform and you can have multiple different question types there's and it's really quite engaging. You can have gifts and images and, you know, single choice, multiple choice in line association and you can randomize it. So no two learners will get the same evaluation. And then we have observation checklists which will be really important in particular to your operators in your internal learner group. So they can self observe or maybe their Instructor can observe them or their line manager can observe them performing X tasks, X amount of tasks. And then obviously core survey is to gather that feedback now in terms of analytics. And I think this is really going to be key especially in measuring and improving training over time with both the internal Audience, but also the external both from customers and these new graduates coming through from school. We do have, which may not be necessary in phase one but it might be phase two, phase three, you know, two years down the road, whatever the case may be, but we always like to show the art of the possible. We do have two modules. One called Docebo learning impact, which is all about measuring training effectiveness, getting real data information around how is the content, how the handouts? How's the trainer? Am I actually understanding the one content? You can even get import from a 360 view, so the manager, the Instructor can actually engage. And over time is that training actually being effective in their day to day lives and how they really retain that knowledge? So you can actually measure that training effectiveness at scale. And we also have a product called learn a module called learned data which would allow you to actually extract all the information automatically from the platform. And I know, I believe you utilize Power BI and have dashboards with Power B. I, you could actually have all that learned data and connect it with revenue, customer, NPS internal, you know, employee engagement and things like that. And so you could actually connect all of that information and drive change using that as well. So I just wanted to touch on that because I think…\nANDYKIMPTON\n20:09 \nIn…\nMALLORY\n20:10 \nOrder to know.\nANDYKIMPTON\n20:10 \nWhat we're looking for and we're still doing a fair bit of work with dynamics and I bring with another partner in relation to that. But no, this is great. And what it also facilitates is the sort of life cycle of the call learn from. So, you know, that originally onboarding all the way through their career, which is great. And then it also then helps us have a look at our skills gaps as well when we're recruiting. So that's…\nMALLORY\n20:39 \nYeah, great. Excellent. And then I'll quickly touch on Instructor led. So we do facilitate both your face to face and also Webinar training.\nCourse Enrollment\nMALLORY\n20:51 \nSo we allow you to provide, you know, the map, the location details, including images to really guide the learner to where they need to go. And then you can bride information on the different events, the room that, that's going to be out. If it is classroom training, the Webinar link directly from here. So a little button will appear to say join Webinar at the time of the event. And then to mark attendance, you can even request with teams or Zoom that it automatically marks attendance when they join that Webinar. Or we do have deeper integrations that allow you to mark attendance. Once you have for example, a 90 percent view of that Webinar. And so there's no sort of China scramble and check sessions and view times and things like that. It will update automatically.\nANDYKIMPTON\n21:36 \nIf someone's in a Webinar, like in a generic sense, when they check in, do we know if they check out like, you know, they open? Because they then say tick the box attended that. But the tick five minutes later, they tick the box and go out show that they've been involved in that for the whole period of that Webinar.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Andy and Mallory discussed partnering with vendors and opening an open day at Mount Drew, as well as providing a demonstration to view.\n• Mallory spoke about the layout and content of their platform, including learning plans, coach and share, agnostic material, evaluation tools, questions and answers, conversation starters, surveys, analytics modules, face-to-face training with Webinar links for attendance. \n• Andy discussed skills gaps in relation to onboarding and career paths. END"}
{"prompt":"MALLORY\n21:58 \nYou can definitely do that with the deeper integration with teams or Zoom. So you can have that using our data connect product which will actually read… the video view time, so the Webinar view time. So if it will understand that Webinar was maybe two hours, it will only mark them attended. If they've at least attended, say an hour and a half or an hour in 20 minutes. Yeah, yeah, yeah… great. So that, that's and obviously classroom training isn't just about going to the event.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nMALLORY\n22:34 \nYou also want to provide them maybe with a hand out something that you need them to read beforehand to come to quest with to come to the session with questions. Maybe you want to then have a test as part of that or a course survey to gather that feedback.\nCourse Enrollment\nMALLORY\n22:49 \nYou can have that all within the one ILT session. So it really centralizes it for the learner and makes it really easy for them to know exactly where they need to go through all that training information… and then going back to sort of out. And this is actually our employee training.\nPayment Gateway\nMALLORY\n23:06 \nThis could be an example for employees. So, you know, a little bit different. Here is an example of what eCommerce could look like on the platform. So you can actually sell in dividual courses, whether it be E learning content or workshops, you know, webinars, all of that can be sold through the platform. You can also sell subscription plans and bundles. So potentially you want to sell the ability to have a team of 30 people that they have 30 operators and they want to be able to buy all the content from the platform for a month or a year. So they could actually do that through the subscription bundle plans that you could make available.\nPayment Gateway ends\nMALLORY\n23:48 \nYou can have a calendar of scheduled training to make it really visible to the learner. And then one thing that I love which I think I hope you will as well, which really drives that employee engagement, that value proposition as well that knowledge retention that you're speaking about which is so key is around the communities.\nCoach & Share\nMALLORY\n24:07 \nSo you're able to create different communities where people can then share and get expert advice. And so you assign panels of experts. So people in your organization that have long tenure, you have 15 year tenure, you know, everything, you know, the industry back to front. You want to be able to allow them to share because that is also an one for them. I would hope to be tapped on the shoulder and say, hey, can you please, you know, be part of this great project? You assign them to these channels and they can moderate, so they can add content. They can answer people's questions, they can moderate content that learners might. Want to share as well if you allow that within that community and it really allows them to be able to really retain that knowledge and share what they have amongst the organization. And so you assign the different communities, you could have a client, you know, customers communities, you can have the different industries, the different equipments, for example, you can have your internal staff have a community and it could be maybe your legal team or your finance team, have their own community where they can share about, you know, company updates, marketing team could have a community where they share marketing updates and product, new product brochures and things like that, that's easily accessible to learners and they're able to, you know, go into the content. They can consume that content. You can even have the a, I recommend additional learning based on the learner profile, and then they're able to access the experts for this and comment and start a conversation around that. So I think this is, will be useful in multiple different aspects of your business, but…\nCoach & Share ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n25:54 \nThis, if we define what skills matrix is for each different role, we can then map through this to say, you know, you've done seven out of the 10 required skill sets that make that your obligations of your position description, can we do that sort of mapping as well?\nMALLORY\n26:16 \nSo what you can do is definitely have skills. So as part of skills from a learner, this is an example of a dashboard that they'll have available to them, so they can actually map the skills that they want to be working on within the platform. And as an administrator, you can assign content to those skills from the skills catalog. And we have quite an extensive skills catalog within the platform itself. And if you don't if you don't find the particular skill, you need, you can always add your own skills to that as well.\nANDYKIMPTON\n26:47 \nSo as part of the process, we get access to that content that you guys have developed already.\nMALLORY\n26:55 \nSo we have a couple of options actually. So as part of skills, you can actually ask the AI to bring in information from external sources. So you can either have an allow list of maybe 10 sites that, you know, are reputable and related to your industry. And so they're the ones that you can sort of crawl information and bring that in for the learner to access for those particular skills.\nIntegrations\nMALLORY\n27:17 \nWe also have a content marketplace where we have close to 100,000 pieces of content that you can actually bring into the platform. And so to those specific skills as well. Or you can have your own content that you can assign to those skills. You know, you'll have obviously technical skills that you'll have a lot of content. I know that you're working with this great Instructor that will have a lot of content in terms of particular technical skills. But maybe there's some soft skills that you also want your staff to work on, maybe some sales skills, some negotiation skills, some leadership skills. We have that content also within the platform as part of our content marketplace.\nANDYKIMPTON\n27:59 \nAnd… so the modules for compliance, you know, pulling in resent any prior interruption, all that sort of stuff.\nMALLORY\n28:08 \nWe have all of that. We have a lot of it. Yes, we have a lot of that. We partner with I'm, not sure if you've maybe heard of them. You've we partner with go one and they, we, they work with over 200 content providers. And so you can imagine we have it's kind of I'm gonna steal your phrase. Rick, it's kind of like a netflix, you have every flavor, you have, every topic. It's quite extensive, different languages as well, different types of content, you know, scorm videos, you know, all different, whatever it is that you need. So we can definitely explore that as an option as well.\nIntegrations ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n28:48 \nYeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Mallory demonstrated how deeper integration with Teams or Zoom can be used to gauge viewing time of a webinar in order to assign attendance.\n• She also proposed providing learners with a handout, a test and/or a course survey as part of an ILT session.\n• Mallory suggested using communities within the platform that experts can moderate and add content to, as well as AI recommending additional learning based on the learner profile.\n• Go 1 is partnered with to provide content in multiple languages and formats such as SCORM videos. END"}
{"prompt":"MALLORY\n28:51 \nYes. So so again, they'll be able to definitely work on their skills. They could have their managers import. They can have a, I suggest skills based on their learner profile and, you know, their job role and things like that. And then over time, they can see their improvement on the level of competency. So they can see where they started where they're heading… and to make that available. And then as part of the communities actually, I'm just gonna check that it's in there. Let me just see because I might have taken it out because we haven't really touched on competencies. Let me just see if I have it. Okay. I don't have any content assigned to skills, but you can actually create a community where they're able to surface skill based content and so they can actually go in there and they can actually filter on the skills. Obviously, I don't have content, find it is a trial environment. I can work towards having some things but they're able to actually build on the skills and then all surface content based on those skills. Their skills… okay. Excellent. And then obviously we have, I'll just jump back to the academy actually. So gamification, I think was, is going to be really exciting for kick starting this program. So you can have badges. They can externally share these badges on, you know, social media, LinkedIn or wherever it is that they want to share that. And you can have them earn points stars which that they can exchange in a rewards shop. You can have leader boards which can be anonymized if you choose them to be. And you can have different leader boards, you know, if you want to assign to different learner groups and contests as well. And then once they have earned those points, they can actually exchange them in a rewards shop and you can assign different rewards to different learner groups. So it could be even that they come into your operation center for a day and get to check out, you know, where the happens. It doesn't have to be monetary although obviously who's going to turn down and Uber eats touch, but, you know, it doesn't have to be monetary, it could be a mentoring session. We've seen customers do all sorts of things. It could be that you have paid eCommerce courses. And if they have certain activities within the platform, you actually unlock that content for them automatically and things like that. So something to really kick start that activity.\nANDYKIMPTON\n31:15 \nAnd…\nRICK\n31:17 \nCan I just add we're seeing growing popularity in terms of rewards coffee with the CEO. So maybe that might be something.\nROGER\n31:27 \nCalendar…\nANDYKIMPTON\n31:29 \nThat for free? Yeah.\nRICK\n31:33 \nI have some value to that Andy.\nROGER\n31:35 \nBut I…\nMALLORY\n31:38 \nOpen up that calendar you're going to get busy.\nANDYKIMPTON\n31:43 \nYeah. You know, with 80 people across the business, we're small enough that we, and tight enough that we can do that. But this sort of stuff is really good when we're looking forward to how we grow for.\nPayment Gateway\nMALLORY\n31:56 \nYeah. And this applies to external customers as well. Obviously, you're not gonna want hundreds or to potentially thousands of people booking you for coffee, but there, there is other ways that you can definitely organize that. Yeah.\nANDYKIMPTON\n32:12 \nBut it might be for external one. Now they get to 10,000, and then there's you know, one free module or something like that.\nMALLORY\n32:20 \nExactly. That's exactly right? And that's something that is very popular when you are, when you do have eCommerce as part of the platform that's a very popular option to have that available. Definitely excellent. Or it could even be, it doesn't have to be free. It could be like a discount code to be able to that with like a 20 percent discount or something.\nMobile App\nMALLORY\n32:46 \nOkay. So from sort of a learners perspective, that really is what I wanted to show you. I will jump into the mobile experience if that's okay by you. Okay? So I'll just open up my phone here. So I am actually on a mobile device. So the same device seeing on the screen. So I'm not, I promise, I'm not being rude. I'm just navigating my phone here. You'll see that we have a little blue icon at the bottom of the screen. So this app is actually called to go learn app. It is free with the platform and it is free to download both from iOS app store and android play store. We do also have a fully branded mobile app that is available if you choose to, that obviously comes at a cost but it would have, you know, your core logos and it does come with a few additional features such as biometrics log in for the learner and things like that. But otherwise, you know, especially phase one might be using the go learn app.\nAbout Docebo\nANDYKIMPTON\n33:50 \nI think our brand is critical to us because, you know, the brand recognition of core is what we're driving really solidly because we've established ourselves with a, and others. But now, you know, the brand recognition is what we go to, whatever we do for that. Delta. I always suggest that we do a brand. And so.\nMobile App\nMALLORY\n34:12 \nOkay. Okay. Noted. Thank you. All right. Well, then we can definitely explore that with Roger for sure. Okay. So the experience visually will be very similar the first time they'll log into the go learn app. Obviously the brand of mobile app will go straight into the sign on for them.\nMobile App ends\nMALLORY\n34:33 \nBut the first time they'll log into go learn, you just have to add the I or L just so it recognizes which platform to drive to. And then they'll sign in using single sign on or use the name and password same as they would on the desktop. So it's a seamless experience for them.\nLayout & Content\nMALLORY\n34:50 \nOnce they log in, they'll be greeted with the exactly the same page that they would get on the desktop. So if it's a customer, they'll get the customer landing page. If it's an employee internal employees, they'll get the inter, an employee landing. And so it really creates just a seamless transition from desktop to mobile for them because they'll recognize exactly where they need to go to access the learning that they need.\nLayout & Content ends\nMALLORY\n35:14 \nAnd so I can see here, this is my learning plan. So I've got the E learning courses, the Instructor led training. I can go into that. I can see the questions and answers within the course down here. I can see the file repository. If I want to download those files, I can go to the content and actually view the videos, the PPTS, everything on the phone.\nMobile App\nMALLORY\n35:38 \nI can even download them. If I'm going off data, I can download them, have them available offline. And then when I come back online to file or mobile data, then it will actually update my completions within the platform. And so I don't have to then go back through it again.\nMobile App ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n35:53 \nRoger, would this be the platform that or train resides on?\nROGER\n35:58 \nAbsolutely. Yes. That's my thinking. We currently have a partnership with another provider for… video based learning. Put it that way where the QR code is. In some cases, I think it's still attached to the trucks… and that allows for immediate say if someone's on the road, they can log into potentially this system and look at videos supporting their understanding or get them out of trouble or just refresh on some operational component of their work. And that's what I was referring to with core train because we do have a system in place at the moment but it needs to be uplifted somewhat. And I consider that component of core as in core train sitting in this LMS.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Mallory presented a mobile app, Go Learn, featuring single sign-on ability and offline downloads.\n• Andy mentioned a partnership with another provider for video based learning where QR code is attached to trucks.

{"prompt":"ANDYKIMPTON\n37:03 \nAnd that, that's very much at the moment.\nPayment Gateway\nANDYKIMPTON\n37:07 \nWe include with the sale of the truck with a consideration in the sale price… but we can't securitiz it so we can't once someone's open, they, they've got it forever because of the QR codes. So we need to look at how that subscription might work, but it set us apart.\nPayment Gateway ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n37:29 \nWe've got the core training Q code on the truck. And we also have the plan risk assessment on the truck. So walk up and you want to look at the risk assessment, you scan the code and then the very detailed independent risk assessment which is truck based not generic. We're the only people in the industry that do that as well.\nMALLORY\n37:49 \nThat's very advanced and that, this is quite the, this is quite, yeah, I'm quite impressed. I've not heard of that level of detail at the truck level especially to have that really precise information. So that's really impressive you.\nANDYKIMPTON\n38:07 \nDefinitely be to.\nMALLORY\n38:08 \nIntegrate that with this.\nANDYKIMPTON\n38:10 \nShare what it is and how it is and all that sort of stuff. But the risk assessments have actually been a substantial commercial benefit for a lot of our clients. Because now on many tier one infrastructure sites, your truck has to be inducted. So you have to have the risk assessment, you have to have the details. So we're the only one that can walk up the safe, you guys walk up scan, look at risk assessment being done. A way you go here's, the training. And then the next stage is have those verification on competencies for each of the 14 units by the operator. So an operator like in here would have a cap passport or one of a better term. And here's all the models that I've got verification of prominence for and plus the four units of competency training quality framework.\nCertifications\nMALLORY\n39:05 \nSo that's actually triggered something for me within the courses or within the learning plans, you can actually create a fully branded personalized certificate. So at the completion, it can have the information about the, what date, what it is that they completed certification that's tied to that and applied. And then if that's something that expires for example, and you need them to renew that every 12 months, then you can actually tie that to a certification and send Automatic reminders. And.\nANDYKIMPTON\n39:39 \nAnd that's really important to the commerce part of it because once the industry standard is refreshes every two years.\nPricing\nANDYKIMPTON\n39:48 \nSo, if that way someone's coming up for a refresher date and they're not in the same organization, I've moved on and blah blah, blah. This would be the industry based standard that we can apply and you can think about exponentially. We've got 565 capital to, in the market today, and we're putting about 120 130 more in every year plus that.\nAbout Docebo\nANDYKIMPTON\n40:12 \nSo you think about just the exposure of that alone is substantial without even thinking about spot or the units that we could potentially build verification of prominence for our competitors. So our competitors would have to come to us for training as well.\nMALLORY\n40:30 \nYeah. Wow. That's…\nRICK\n40:32 \nYeah.\nMALLORY\n40:34 \nIt's it's quite impressive Growth as well.\nAbout Docebo ends\nMALLORY\n40:36 \nIt's quite a lot of trucks coming out every year. So… the ability to scale is going to be important to keep up with that as well.\nANDYKIMPTON\n40:45 \nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\nMALLORY\n40:47 \nYeah. Okay. Great. That, yeah, it's been insightful to say the least today's. Discussion. Yeah, I mean I…\nANDYKIMPTON\n40:58 \nYou online, wearing?\nMALLORY\n41:00 \nHow you can set up the subscription plans of making them available to customers to, you know, to the right products and have that available to them? And yeah, okay.\nRICK\n41:13 \nAndy, I'll have a quick question, very left field. But yeah, it sounds like you're saying, you know, core is going above and beyond in terms of compliance. In terms of enablement training, certification. It's yeah, it sounds like you're really at that industry leader level? What impact is it having on say your insurance policies? Are you paying lower insurances result? And if, and would, implementing further, you know, sort of processes like this? Would that have an impact on insurance?\nAbout Docebo\nANDYKIMPTON\n41:46 \nNo, because once we hand the truck the operating company clients, then the obligation for how they operate that truck, you know, so our relationship is then in the past and after sales capability. But if you're doing nondestructive digging in your company like Randal, for example, we've got 70 of that trucks, you know, the with them having this, they've already seen that, but they get onto tier one site before the, you know, because we have a continuum of our clients being the tier one clients got 50 60 70 of our trucks.\nPricing\nANDYKIMPTON\n42:27 \nAnd then you've got the bar, the entry people that come out of lower level getting and raining and back loading in smaller units to get into the first capital. And so the first one but 50 percent of our clients to buy their first truck by a second one within 12 months. And because we offer straight sale lease and least to buy funded by core under our 78,000,000 dollar floor plan, then the barriers to entry for these people is smaller. So we then say you can then train your operator. You can do this one stop shop. We've got carrying 7,000,000 dollars worth of parts at any one time in Australia for short that.\nAbout Docebo\nANDYKIMPTON\n43:15 \nSo we've got service capability in all the states of mobile. And so it becomes part of the more value add and what our value proposition for working with core. But I see a fairly substantive eCommerce capability out of it. Once people realize that and to be check the bringing the regulators into this training and showing them what level of standard for this industry is.\nAbout Docebo ends\nANDYKIMPTON\n43:45 \nThen they go away and think, well, hang on a minute. I didn't know that I didn't know this. Therefore then when they go onto sites and do inspections, I ask and the state of knowledge for industrial services. It sits with core, not no one else. And then the other part of this is using this using our academy to then Chase safety rewards and grants across the different regulators because they say, you know, we've got safety ward in south trainers, Victoria. For this product. It's been awarded by the safety regulators or the environmental regulators based on some of the sustainability capabilities that it can produce as well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Andy provides core training, risk assessment and verification on competency for truck operators.\n• They are the only ones in the industry to have such a detailed system at the truck level.\n• With their services, customers get access to branded personalized certificates and automatic reminders for renewal of certifications.\n• Andy has 565 capital trucks in the market as well as 120-130 more added every year.\n• Their services enable clients to get on tier one infrastructure sites with ease and grants from regulators can be chased with their academy.

{"prompt":"RICK\n44:32 \nThat's incredible. And you clearly looking at this and as a visionary looking at other ways this can be applied, you know, in terms of different use cases and so forth that's in red.\nANDYKIMPTON\n44:43 \nAnd because I've got probably my background is more risk compliance safety. And then operations, this is just to me, it's a non even just talking to our clients. I've done a road show over the last three months that we build it, they will come and we want to be the first.\nPricing\nRICK\n45:06 \nI…\nMALLORY\n45:07 \nHave I have something that you just whenever you're speaking now, it's triggering ideas in terms of how we can fit around your business. You mentioned they're a key client of yours rainedale, is it range now? So they have 80 trucks, a quite a substantial amount of your 500 fleet… you know, would they see value?\nPricing ends\nMALLORY\n45:31 \nAnd would you see the value of actually having a, you know, an LMS that's branded to them with your content, but their branding is actually from them to their?\nANDYKIMPTON\n45:42 \nHave that discussion with the founder and owner, new can in recent times. And once we get this up, is that what he wants to do is exactly that, but he doesn't want to carry that in his business.\nPayment Gateway\nANDYKIMPTON\n45:57 \nHe wants to partner with call. So we could potentially think about when we do the certifications to range the deal brand in the certificates or something like that.\nMALLORY\n46:10 \nTo them, you can brand the entire just like we've separated the branding for the internals and the client and your customer base. You could take it to the next level. And we do actually have a lot of customers of ours will do that. They'll have their longer tail of clients that they'll have the standard, you know, core academy with your branding. You have that maybe one, two, three top accounts, top clients that you work with, and you'll actually provide that branded experience speaking to their employees as if they were rain Dale with your training content and it's all managed from the one administrator.\nAbout Docebo\nANDYKIMPTON\n46:45 \nWe would, we would definitely look at that. Like I can take for example, probably the leaders in the safety space in this area here. We met with the Australian a CEO in December to talk about this sort of stuff and would jump on it as well. P, M a and CS a would do the same there to the clients. And every time a role is vision out to our clients, is they're not saying no, they're just saying when?\nMALLORY\n47:21 \nThat's great. So why don't I do this? So you mentioned via violi, I'm really sorry if I get the name.\nANDYKIMPTON\n47:27 \nIs VEOMII?\nMALLORY\n47:29 \nYeah. Okay. And I have heard of it.\nANDYKIMPTON\n47:32 \nYou probably say more of them around the white tracks and, but they've got about 50 of their trucks in Australia as well.\nMALLORY\n47:40 \nOkay. So what would you say if I make a few adjustments? And instead of showing the core academy as I did here, I actually create something that would be for Violia specifically as well in that video for.\nANDYKIMPTON\n47:53 \nYeah, why not?\nMALLORY\n47:54 \nYeah. Okay. Beautiful. All right.\nANDYKIMPTON\n47:58 \nDon't you do install, I can send you their website internal, the founder manager owner of rain was very good friend with that with our founder. So that would strike a strong recorder thing.\nAbout Docebo ends\nMALLORY\n48:13 \nOkay. All right. I'll do that then. Well, let's do that. I'll do rainsdale. I'll create an experience that someone from rainsdale that has one of your cable trucks could come in and experience from core. Yeah. Okay. Beautiful.\nANDYKIMPTON\n48:31 \nI just have the first part of it with core and then the second part what it would look like from a customer perspective? Yeah.\nROGER\n48:39 \nIt'd be great.\nMALLORY\n48:40 \nExactly. That's. What I'm thinking. I'll skip the internal employee use case, I think for the board and just focus on… someone from via specifically and then sort of the longer tail from.\nANDYKIMPTON\n48:53 \nIf you're doing the internal one first, so they see the core component and then just show them that can be duplicated as an example with an…\nSmall Talk\nMALLORY\n49:04 \nI…\nROGER\n49:04 \nRan on.\nMALLORY\n49:06 \nYeah, beautiful.

So we still have our old space, and then some of us are in the new space too. I see if I can get.\nDAMASO\n0:39 \nI hook up getting the new environment.\nJESSICA\n0:44 \nYeah. Well, we have standing desks for the first time. So… I'm pretty excited about that.\nDAMASO\n0:51 \nThat's the one thing that I miss about actually having like my original home base is that I had a standing desk for, we would like move up and down, you know, and so obviously can't pack that in the card bouncing around living in the different places that we have. So I'm stuck with whatever desk furnishings that the apartments that we move into have and.\nJESSICA\n1:13 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n1:13 \nI can't really stand up as much as I used to which.\nJESSICA\n1:16 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n1:17 \nI go for a walk there's, approach to it. But still one thing that…\nJESSICA\n1:25 \nIn Boston before now, you're in Miami, you said?\nDAMASO\n1:27 \nYeah. Yeah. All over the place. I think perhaps when we had first started our discussions or maybe it was right as we started or right before I would have been in Chicago. And then I was in Boston for a couple of months and then now we're here and my will be here. We've been here since November. We'll be here through the beginning of March. So then it's back home to Atlanta.\nJESSICA\n1:51 \nOkay. That's how you don't accumulate things, just constantly move.\nDAMASO\n1:55 \nYeah, exactly. I mean, we kinda came to realize that, you know, we don't really miss a whole lot of our stuff that we left them storage back in Atlanta, you know, I mean, we have like all of our furniture, our mattresses, like all that stuff and the kitchen stuff too. You know? So, I mean, some of it, we may not realize we missed just because everything that we've been staying and has been furnished, but, you know, otherwise, it definitely made us realize, you know, what? We have, a lot more stuff than what we actually need. So definitely, when we go back, we'll try to do some consolidating, you know?\nJESSICA\n2:26 \nYeah. Hey.\nSCOTT\n2:27 \nDo, if you ever want force consolidation, just move into an apartment in greenwich village.\nDAMASO\n2:32 \nYeah.\nSCOTT\n2:34 \nI lived in 300 square feet. There was no opportunities to acquire anything if you bought something had to like go out to make room, right?\nDAMASO\n2:44 \nYeah, that'll do it for sure.\nSmall Talk ends\nDAMASO\n2:46 \nSo anyways, well, appreciate you catching up with this here. Jessica. I know we have a chance to catch up at the beginning of the week. I wanted to ask you any, you know, questions or how did you feel about after our meeting with step to join us to talk a little bit more about services? You feel a little bit more comfortable with regards to, you know, what other options that we have out there and the information that I sent you as a?\nJESSICA\n3:09 \nYeah. I really appreciated that email follow up with the cost and kind of breakdown and some information with that now that I'm back to be in a solo team. So that was good.\nDAMASO\n3:19 \nPut out and again with that stuff, of course, it's not required that's really just there's an option for you if you all decide that, you know, you think you need it. And I think we talked about it. You know, in one of our back and forth feed email too, I had a customer of mine that I was working on a last year, I guess while we would have began our discussions is when kind of we were wrapping up their evaluation with them and, you know, they had hired her specifically to come on board and begin, you know, this new land department, they didn't have a leg which actually, you know, is very similar to your situation, right? And so, you know, with her, she, I think where you have the leg up is that you do have that land experience. She didn't or doesn't I should say she came straight from the K through 12, you know, teacher world, you know. And so there's an element of education that goes along with that, right? But it's totally when you start getting into the enterprise learning space. So regardless, you know, with her, she actually just caught up with her. I was right before I left for the kick off last week but just to check and see how things are going. And she said everything's been going great for her.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n4:23 \nShe didn't necessarily for her specifically like she wasn't given the additional budget or funds to be able to leverage some of the additional service packages that we have. But she felt confident with where she ended up by working with our team as a part of what's a part of the gold standard launch pack which is, you know, what we're initially recommending to you all as well. So either way, you know, different needs, you know, I'll be a similar use case similar situation. But, you know, every customer that we work with is unique. So I just bring that up again just for the sake of it is possible whether or not you decide to help supplement your team just to ensure that, you know, you have, you know, all of your bases covered for support standpoint that we could offer great. We're happy to do that otherwise with what's generally available out of the box and, you know, knowing people can go through that process, you know, on their own, stand things up still within the reasonable time frame that they were targeting originally, it is possible. So.\nJESSICA\n5:17 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n5:18 \nSo with that, I know we wanted to schedule today's discussion to really just kinda highlight one of the, I guess modules that we didn't necessarily like spend a whole lot of time on or at least reviewed during our initial assessments, going through the preliminary demonstrations and things like that.\nOnboarding ends\nDAMASO\n5:37 \nBut in the spirit of kind of where you're at in your evaluation and really understanding what's on the table for you all when it comes to Docebo, one one additional modules that we've especially revamped over the course of last year is our Docebo skills module, which is, you know, our performance management aspect of the solution and how it all ties together, right? So that is something for the, of doubt that is included with your purchase of the learn LMS which of course, we understand is kinda the Cornerstone of all of this, right? So we thought it might make sense just to briefly walk you through it today, you know, see if there might be any use cases or questions you might have from a skills or performance management standpoint, show you how it works. And then from there, I very much doubt will take the full hour that we had originally scheduled for today. But I did spend some time over the past few days going through and revisiting some of the slides that you would share with me and which again, thanks for sending those over. I spent some time putting together some of my own slides with some different screenshots, snippet, you know, kind of summaries or whatever you wanna call it. And also incorporated a little bit more things with regards to, you know, customer testimonials, screenshots of their instance, you know, and a couple of other items too. So we can spend some time going through that again with you today. And then of course, you know, address any other questions you may have. So does that sound good? Or was there anything else you wanted to make sure we went through?\nJESSICA\n7:01 \nNo, that's perfect.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Onboarding was discussed—Damaso shared that his customer hired someone from K-12 teaching world similar to Jessica's situation—with the use of \"Gold Standard Launch Pack\". \n• Damaso suggested introducing Docebo Skills Module as Performance Management, which include Customer Testimonials & Instance Screenshots.

There's the manager view.\nJESSICA\n15:14 \nOkay.\nSCOTT\n15:15 \nSo really just wanted to take a quick pivot… and we can, you know, we can come back and revisit the learner view.\nUser Permission\nSCOTT\n15:23 \nBut when we look at the manager view as dumb kind of framed up for us, managers can also go into their team, right? One click. I'm in my team from there as a manager. Again, this is that kind of permission based role where maybe I can see inside of one team or one location or one division. So you can really get… dialed in on what the Power user can see. In this case, they just have a team. I've got my skills overview here. So I can see the different skills that people are managing on my team. I can see any changes that have happened recently based on my team.\nIntegrations\nSCOTT\n16:11 \nIf I come down here, I can see any content that's really resonating with my team to. So are people consuming content, what's available, what's been consumed? This is kind of a nice simple visual for the managers to really see what specific content in each area, right? For time management for leadership, what's really being consumed?\nIntegrations ends\nSCOTT\n16:34 \nWhat's available? So just a nice view there. I can also have that view into individual skills. So I can see all right on my team, everybody seems to be interested in time management. So I've got five users aligned against that skill. I can see any content that might be any of the course work, whether it's internal or, you know, external content. I can see what's aligned with it. I can see the overall average across time management for my team, you can click into any of these and kinda see, you know, the expertise, the level based on my team, right? Where everybody sits. So, you know, if you're looking to do some resource management, just a nice way to say, you know, what? Barry's got these skills, he could probably pick that task up, you know, savior definitely has those skills. He could probably pick this up. So, nice way to let managers have that visual insight.\nJESSICA\n17:35 \nAnd for these particular widgets that you see when we change the language, do those widgets change from English to, because they're kind of system output at that point, does that make sense? So… yeah.\nSCOTT\n17:51 \nSo, yeah, which just like the titles of widgets, et cetera.\nJESSICA\n17:55 \nSo, because these are generated by like where it says expert advanced intermediate beginner for where your mouse is at, does that change to the language because it's generated by the?\nSCOTT\n18:06 \nGood question. I don't believe. So, I'm gonna test it right now, however, you can localize anything in the platform. So, if you wanted to change the language specifically, you could do that via localization as an admin, but let me just do that test just for kicks here and kinda see what that looks like. I'm feeling extra Polish today. No, I am Polish but let's choose Spanish.\nJESSICA\n18:41 \nMe too half full to share. My mom is.\nSmall Talk\nSCOTT\n18:44 \nReally? Yeah, three quarters.\nJESSICA\n18:46 \nNo, my, yeah. My great grandmother came over on the boat and Polish people married Polish people, married Polish people. And then as my mom jokes, she diluted the Gene pool with my dad. So there you go. Nice.\nSCOTT\n18:59 \nYeah. Let's take a quick look here.\nSmall Talk ends\nSCOTT\n19:07 \nNo, no, no, it isn't this goes over to checklist.\nDAMASO\n19:14 \nSave before we went in.\nSCOTT\n19:17 \nI don't think, I don't think it did.\nSCOTT\n19:29 \nIt didn't do. Thank you.\nDAMASO\n19:33 \nI see it and I carry over. I'm Spanish myself. So at least half, so I know what is supposed to look like and so.\nSCOTT\n19:52 \nMaybe something's up the trial environment. It didn't save. Yeah, it didn't save. Shouldn't I just be able to… sign in here.\nDAMASO\n20:09 \nYeah. And…\nSCOTT\n20:10 \nHave it. Have the.\nDAMASO\n20:12 \nYeah. My one thing that comes to mind, I sent, you know, that they did give the trial sites an update beginning of, I guess I want about beginning of January or so. So. The one that we had open because we had this project open for a while is on the.\nSCOTT\n20:28 \nRight.\nDAMASO\n20:29 \nVersion, so it may be carrying over those new rules or roll outs that they had on the trial is recently, so that's my one.\nSCOTT\n20:38 \nYes.\nDAMASO\n20:39 \nThe reason why it's not rendering the way that we need to.\nSCOTT\n20:42 \nJessica, I can test that. I don't believe it would do it, but I can certainly test that.\nJESSICA\n20:49 \nI was just kinda curious.\nDAMASO\n20:51 \nYeah, that's just for the skills portion itself. Now, one thing to keep in mind. So going back to Scott earlier point with the localization tool as well as the options to have folks self select. So… with folks being able to self select those languages or have preset for whatever, anything that's hard coded into the platform is going to handle that translation for you. Now, one thing that we talked about is, you know, it is the responsibility of our customers to ensure that the content itself is translated into those language of need. However that also is where we had talked about the leverage Shape or a lot of your content translation needs. Also particularly for your documents might be a little bit more text heavy, you know, being able to, instead of having to write it all through a Google translate and then copy and paste back into that. Yeah, whatever it is, word, doc, PDF, powerpoint, whatever you can use Shape to be able to handle those translations for you?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott walked through how a manager can “dial-in” with resources management and see an overview of the skills, users aligned against those skills, and content resonating with their team.\n• Scott and Jessica discuss localization options and if it applies to the widget titles.\n• They also discuss leveraging Shape for document translation needs. END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n21:54 \nBut we can double check on that and see to see if the skills portion of it will render. But one thing I was gonna say with the manager view while we were looking at it is when folks have that skills module pulled up against your earlier point, while it isn't necessarily so much kind of that true performance management function that I think a lot of people expect with something like this, there we go… with, yeah, it looks like it. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So the actual subjects themselves aren't being translated but the things that are hard coded are, which is… there we go. Good ones, what I was, what I was saying before is when it comes to how we see the skills module leverage from a process standpoint by folks who do have a team of direct reports and things like that. This is typically something that they'll use kind of in prep for those discussions they may have with their team. So whether it's a team meeting at or perhaps, you know, a scheduled one on one or performance review with an employee, right? Typically, a good portion of those conversations do have something attributed to what they've been doing either from a skills management standpoint, the training that's been completed or certifications, and so on, right? A lot of people also use this for the sake of succession planning. If they've identified someone who believe might be in line for a possible promotion or a leadership type role, right there's, a lot of potential trainings that they could subsequently either be enrolled into on behalf of the manager or the leadership team Advent whoever, or it could be something that for their own personal development that they want to, you know, develop their skills in those areas. I'm just using a general example, those are the opportunities to be able to leverage something like this for those specific reasons. So really it's just more for the sake of having information at your disposal truly get a good feel for what's actually going on, what people are interested in and, you know, what people are taking. And so on, this is something that's very handy. And a lot of times people just even just pull up this individual screen for that user that they might be meeting with.\nJESSICA\n23:59 \nYeah, to change it.\nSCOTT\n24:00 \nYeah. I just had to make sure our user was aligned to the language and took it. So absolutely, I have to change it back just because now I'm like totally test any questions.\nDAMASO\n24:13 \nI can help you.\nSCOTT\n24:15 \nDo you and I have to have every conversation today? Then you stick with me on all my meetings.\nDAMASO\n24:20 \nYeah. There we go. Cool. But Scott, unless there was anything else I felt like that was, you know, just about all that we wanted to show you from a skills standpoint. So Jessica any questions for us on that or I'd be curious to hear your feedback, you know, any ideas with regards to whether not you all would foresee yourself using something like skills right out the gate or something down the road, at least make like face to face three item?\nJESSICA\n24:44 \nProbably, yeah, a little bit later, I would say with skills just because again, we're learning to, you know, get a crawl to walk through.\nDAMASO\n24:50 \nStart with the basics, you know, yeah, I think going back to one of the common themes that we've had over the course of our entire evaluation, right? You know, with the value of being able to meet you, where you're at while still offering you all the different options to scale with you down the road, that's really something that a lot of people look for in that long term training or enablement partner in terms of a program or a platform, right? So that's really the biggest benefit to having those options to scale into when you feel like everybody versus just finding something that's check the box, good for us right now, short term. And then you're realize you reach the limits of that LMS quite quickly or sooner than a lot of people tend to expect. And then you're right back as square one trying to find that new platform that can support everything. So if you're thinking about something that has what you need and whether or not you decide to use it at your discretion at whatever time it's up to you, but knowing that it's better to have it not use it versus or how's that saying it's better to have it not needed versus needed, not, right? Twister there go.\nJESSICA\n25:56 \nOn your guys long term planning guide, there's still nothing for like evaluation performance, right?\nDAMASO\n26:05 \nAre you talking about like perhaps new feature releases, product, updates, things like that as part of the road map?\nJESSICA\n26:11 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n26:12 \nSo, we had a presentation on the road map last week. I'll be, it was kind of a water down version, you know, how product folks can be there a little bit noncommittal and that type of stuff. However that being said, I do know of some conversations that have taken place inside of the can be requesting specific kind of more let's call it traditional performance management functions and evaluations and things like that. I know it's been a hot topic of ours especially with the past couple of months. So I will see about, you know, what might be included as a part of our product road map. And again, it's all kinda, you know, up in the air as far as whether or not it's scheduled or not or has been released and so on, there's a lot of nuances to it, but I can double check on that and see to see kind of what other people have been saying and how much that has been prioritized in terms of, you know, new product that things.\nJESSICA\n27:04 \nJust curious. Yeah.\nSCOTT\n27:06 \nAnd Jessica, what's top of mind for you? Like what are you in performance management or what are things that you're really looking for?\nJESSICA\n27:17 \nI think I asked the question, you know, primarily because you all were just referencing that you want the system to be scaleable, and that is a great way to make the system scalable… in terms of quarterly and reminding for one on ones and a place to store all of that data and sync it together. Like that would be like wonderful. So.\nSCOTT\n27:42 \nYep.\nDAMASO\n27:44 \nFor that use case several times over the course of the past couple of months especially. So, I think the reason why, you know, Scott asked to elaborate and kind of, you know, understand fully what the ask or the vision for something like that might be is because in addition to the customer feedback that we get, you know, if Scott and I are loud voices in the room advocating for something like this too on, as behalf, it's only something that's only gonna serve to help bump that up the priority list. So it's good to know… cool. Well, I guess while we have Scott here, were there any other questions that you had platform related or otherwise that, you know, we can help you with or maybe something you might need want a refresher on anything like that at all while he's around?\nJESSICA\n28:29 \nNo, I don't think just the screenshots I think would be.\nDAMASO\n28:32 \nYeah. Let's pivot then and Scott, you can stick around if you'd like to. You got a bounce. I understand that's cool too… but yeah, let's go ahead and jump into some of these screenshots. So, Jessica, what I spend some time doing and I'm gonna pull up the presentation here, the version that you shared and how I've updated it, give you a look.\nJESSICA\n28:55 \nYeah. Like I said, I had thoughts, so that was like a stream.\nDAMASO\n28:58 \nYeah, it's all good. Your presentation looks a lot better than a lot of mine 10 to.\nSCOTT\n29:05 \nI wanna hang out and check out some of these screens.\nDAMASO\n29:08 \nYeah, yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso discussed using the skills module for conversations with team members, such as for team meetings or performance reviews.\n• Jessica asked if the system is scaleable for quarterly reminders, data storage, and syncing — Damaso assured her this was something they had discussed before and he will check on what has been prioritized in terms of product updates. \n END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n29:09 \nHow about it?\nDAMASO\n29:10 \nYeah, I wanna Sum it a little bit so we can get a better view too much. We'll just go all right. So this is the same presentation that you shared with me. I didn't wanna like mess around with anything you'd already created more. So my reasoning was let me just add additional slides to it and then she can pick and choose which one she wants to, you know, replace existing slides or just rip some information or a screenshot and incorporate it into the slides she already created. So that was kind of my logic behind it. But in any case, you know, looking at all this, you know, the different slides, benefits things like that. I have, I think if you remember the business case presentation that I had shared with you a while back, I believe that was kind of like a separate slide show that we worked on together. I definitely encourage you if you'd like to kinda see it in that format leveraging some of the different bullet points that we have there as far as, you know, biggest opportunities for improvement, use cases, a current state recap, you know, things are recommended actions or products from negotiate suite, and so on. There's a lot of great imagery that's available in that slide presentation. So if you'd like I can re, share it with you or if you already have it, then I definitely encourage you to revisit that. Otherwise when it comes to screenshots specifically, here's, what I was thinking. So I mean, you can have just like a brief precursor saying, hey, this is what we're about to get into.\nLayout & Content\nDAMASO\n30:30 \nThis is what we're going to show you in this case. So screenshots from asians, an associates academy, whether or not you want to call it your academy or otherwise, it's up to you. But getting into it, I thought it'd be helpful to just kinda show kinda different points of view depending on who you are and accessing the platform, right? So we got this learner experience. You know, we have, you know, different screenshots of the sign in page, how that's going to be rolling can be branded, right? You know, the initial log in screen for a learner when they come in and different options that they have, you could see even from here, you could see like one of your stay videos is incorporated at the top different channels, the calendar widget, and so on moving on wanted to kinda give that view of like that course player.\nLayout & Content ends\nDAMASO\n31:13 \nSo what does it actually look like for someone to take training, right? Especially from an E learning standpoint? So include screenshots of that too. I think in this case, this was just like a scorm file that you know, how to quiz. And so I wanna take a screenshot of that inside of one of the courses we had in your instance. And then same thing goes for if you just wanted to show like what it looks like to take a test. I think when people have these types of discussions or meetings with their executive team, I think those are the types of functions that a lot of people think of when it comes to like something that might be doing that's E, learning related in LMS taking tests going through coursework and so on. And I know you're well equipped and kinda understand kind of how to Articulate, you know, the concept behind it, right? That YouTube look and feel it's got the different, the lessons and the modules and so on the right hand side, so from a familiarity standpoint, and in terms of engagement, it's going to be something that will be very easy to pick up on the behalf of your lunch. So that's…\nJESSICA\n32:07 \nYeah. And I might actually, you said the word Articulate. I got Articulate actually because that's industry standard for creating a lot of stuff.\nDAMASO\n32:14 \nFor sure. Actually. So that screenshot there is an Articulate course.\nJESSICA\n32:18 \nOkay. Good. Yeah, that's what I wanna use. Yeah.\nDAMASO\n32:21 \nYup. All good there. And just now too, this may not be so much for your presentation but just for you to know those score files that you have particularly coming from a Storyline Articulate, whatever… you can either choose to have them play in line like through that little player that you see there or you can have it be a pop out where it takes up your full screen or you can have it open up in a separate window.\nMobile App\nDAMASO\n32:44 \nIt's up to you.\nMobile App ends\nDAMASO\n32:45 \nI normally recommend having play in that little video box and not the small one but the one that goes full screen just so click and engage with it. And then once they completed, they hit next and then they move onto the next lesson in that course. All right.\nCoach & Share\nDAMASO\n32:59 \nSo that's… going into discovery coach share. I know we've had some conversations about that, you know, whether you want to just include the slide in there for the sake of scalability. And knowing that this is some options that you may want to consider for the group, having those channels incorporated in there showing that kind of social Q and a section, and that opportunity for your, you know, example a new hires to engage with your subject matter experts or different topic areas or, you know, segments within the business.\nLayout & Content\nDAMASO\n33:25 \nI thought might be helpful moving on skills dashboard, what we just walkthrough again, the dashboard can be available as its own little page or you can see how that might be associated with perhaps like some of the user transcript. So reporting functions as well too. So that to kinda go hand in hand.\nLayout & Content ends\nDAMASO\n33:42 \nSo this is a great opportunity to just kinda get a good view of both of those items. And again both are included… there's that moving on, I wanted to do a little bit of the back end too. So this may not be as important for your executives that are going to be looking at this, right? But at least for you to mention to them is like, hey, look by the way this has been tested validated by way of trial and otherwise where you've actually gone in and actually got to engage with that admin experience, know what to expect from a user management, course management and then reporting standpoint as well.\nCustom Reports\nDAMASO\n34:14 \nI just pulled that screen grab from that initial homepage. You can go in and find, you know, the reportings tab and pull report that you like that you think looks good. Or if you want to show them like let's say this a sample of a course, what it looks like on the back end.\nCustom Reports ends\nDAMASO\n34:28 \nAnd then, you know, the different properties you might, you know, have the option to configure or modify or, you know, add content or whatever that's up to. You, my experience is that most folks at the executive level don't really care about the back end a little bit. So I mean the to each their own that's their loss.\nUser Permission\nDAMASO\n34:46 \nBut yeah, I at least wanted to make sure that something like this was included. Probably something though that a little bit of a hybrid of the two as, you know, the Power user that's something that they might be a little bit more interested in. So enabling that sub admin access for your managers. Anybody with a team of direct reports, how could they fill that hybrid role of they have their own training that they have to take? But also they need to hold their team members accountable for anything that might be training related that they're doing, right? So how and kinda see using that reportings tab my team view and so on.\nLayout & Content\nDAMASO\n35:17 \nSo took a screenshot of what their homepage would look like. It's kinda hard to see here. I recognize in like this view that I have it up in. But with this, you can see like, all right, you're just saying my dashboard or my homepage as a manager. I can see these are the things that I have on my plate that I need to do from a training standpoint.\nNotifications\nDAMASO\n35:34 \nBut also I see Notifications saying, hey go in and create this test or hey take a look at this person, you know, send the reminder, whatever. So wanted to include both those items here. And I think that just about covers it. So that's what I had in mind.\nNotifications ends\nDAMASO\n35:47 \nI took a look at everything else you included. I have a couple of other items too but in terms of screenshots, does that look good? Or, you know, was there anything perhaps that you thought might be missing that I could go back and revisit?\nJESSICA\n36:00 \nI think maybe, yeah, no, it's really great. I think just adding some, how to document JT and like our manufacturing documentation, like or even just on our Professional services side, like how people would document like PE credits, okay. Professional engineer credits. Yeah. How to track the on the job training is key.\nDAMASO\n36:23 \nYeah, that'll be discover coach and share the on the job training, best place for you all to do that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jessica suggested including documents related to on-the-job training to be handled in Discovery Coach & Share. END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n36:30 \nAnd then the credit hours or let's say external third party training that people might be taking. I don't have the platform in front of me, but if we went back to these… this one, I don't know if you can really see. But while someone's in that kind of user transcript section, there is a little tab here on the left hand side that shows external training that would be the section that I would likely blow up and call out and I can create a separate slide for it to show if someone wanted to report on any, you know, external third party training that they may have completed, whether it's reporting credit hours earned or certificates earned associated with that course. Think of it. For sometimes there's like state or February mandated courses that are offered third party that people have to take. But you also want to report on it for the sake of their HR profiles, just track any for the sake of audits, and otherwise, what type of training that they've completed that's the section where you would go in and have them manage that.\nCoach & Share\nDAMASO\n37:23 \nAnd it can be validated confirmed by someone like yourself or their manager to say, hey, they aren't just like fluffing this up. This is something that's actually legitimate that they are gonna going to be allowed to have associated with.\nJESSICA\n37:35 \nSo back up just a moment, please, you said we have to have discover coach and share to do the on the job.\nCoach & Share ends\nDAMASO\n37:44 \nThat's I said that's where the best place to do that would be, I guess to clarify when you say on the job, what were you thinking in terms of? Or what did you?\nJESSICA\n37:54 \nLike welding, like I think of welding right out of the gate like that's. Not, I can't do like a tig weld online. Of course, I need to be doing those types of well in person.\nDAMASO\n38:05 \nYeah.\nJESSICA\n38:07 \nSo, how to kind of track that some of like our fittings department, I'm thinking like on the assembly floor?\nDAMASO\n38:15 \nYeah.\nJESSICA\n38:16 \nCan…\nDAMASO\n38:17 \nYeah, thanks for clarifying so. And it's just a matter of when I typically think on the job training, I think a bit more as like a social informal like more per your learning experience. I, to you on the shoulder say, hey, how did you think to do this or something like that? You're thinking about it more as like an assessment standpoint, so that's all included with the learn LMS, that would be a formal assessment that you could do. And remember, I think we either talked about it last time or one of the previous discussions. If you wanted to do that on the job training where let's say someone's completing an observation checklist, they're operating on a certain piece of machinery or they're going through a safety checklist before doing something out there on the floor that's being observed by a manager that's a function that included as part of the core MS that you can use to then assess or grade. So one given that pass fail as to whether or not they may have actually successfully completed all the steps and so on or they could even record themselves doing something for the mobile wise. I think we talked about that like I wouldn't work just because I don't think folks are allowed to have their phones on the floor but it, it's not.\nJESSICA\n39:16 \nIt's a little iffy yeah, yeah, no, but some of the observation checklist then and those functions and learn that I think those shots would be essential.\nDAMASO\n39:24 \nI'll do that. So… I'll check this here. So, or?\nSCOTT\n39:34 \nDo I'm taking some of the screenshots right now and sending them over to?\nDAMASO\n39:39 \nGlad you stuck around. Thanks. So me some time here. So third party training tracker will get stuff for the observation checklist as well as the assignment function. All good. Anything else?\nJESSICA\n40:02 \nNo, I think that's it right now?\nDAMASO\n40:04 \nThat's right. Awesome. So those are the screenshots looking through some of the additional slides that you had included as a part of this version, the presentation that you shared with us… I noticed there might be an opportunity to also make use of perhaps some customer case studies as well as an overview of our onboarding support, especially given the recency of the conversation that we have with stuff on Monday, so.\nJESSICA\n40:30 \nAnything regarding like help package details that would be extremely pertinent to for that?\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n40:36 \nAll good. So we'll get into that in just one moment. The customer case study stuff do with it as you will. I thought it was a nice touch. Perhaps some people like to know like, you know, have you validated this with other folks who are either in the same industry, internet, or in a, an adjacent industry or something like that? So I did pull some customer case studies with some interesting figures that I thought might be helpful for you to reference. I'll just kinda.\nJESSICA\n41:00 \nNo worry here. I just have.\nDAMASO\n41:01 \nFor so lazy boy, they use us as you can imagine, they use this for their manufacturing distribution use case as well as their retail locations.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAMASO\n41:10 \nSo as far as like actually selling the products that they manufacture in the stores and so on. So I brought a very diverse Audience as far as who's engaging with it. But some interesting figures here that I thought might be helpful to reference. The same thing goes for one group logistics. They're more in the transportation distribution side of things. But I very similar use case as far as like the type of people that they would typically engage with cool solutions, similar thing similar in that this is just more kind of like that use case similarities because they have a very heavy compliance driven type of setup.\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n41:45 \nSo I thought something like this might be helpful to reference also just to give you that view of it. And then brompton, they do like by people manufacturing so pretty much like manufacturing vice and then have their own retail locations. So another thing too here, they actually lean pretty heavily on like their partners.\nPayment Gateway\nDAMASO\n42:03 \nSo like selling their products, their type of BI pedal devices to certain vendors or retailers that are out there. So they have a pretty significant partner Audience or external Audience in addition to what they're doing internally. So that was kind of like another thing for the sake of scalability, thinking about how you could leverage this and some direct, you know, benefits or wins on both the internal side for employee enablement, but also on the external side to thinking about how we could ultimately make this available to our partners customers and stuff on, right?\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n42:32 \nOkay. So those are the things there. One thing while I'm talking about that and then we'll move onto the support stuff. I did have a conversation with a counterpart of mine who works on the account management side of the business earlier today and… he and I are pretty tight just because I passed over a lot of the accounts, a lot of the larger accounts that I've worked with and helped close Namely super and for, so they, he got to take on those accounts. They've been very… let's say very gifting to him in terms of expansion and things like that. So he and I are pretty tight. He owes me some favors. And so one thing that I was thinking about also because he also helps manage our caterpillar account. So caterpillar cat for sure. Whatever you have this big like whatever I don't know what's called, not my expertise but, you know?\nJESSICA\n43:25 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n43:26 \nThey're actually one of our larger quietly like one of our larger customers in terms of investment that they make with us because they literally use us for both their manufacturing of all the different products that they produce, their sourcing, their materials, their distribution, their dealerships on the corporate side as well, so literally across all Branches and all fastest of the caterpillar business globally.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso and Jessica discussed using Coach & Share to track on-the-job training such as welding and completion of observation checklists.\n• Damaso shared customer case studies from Lazboy, One Group Logistics and Brompton, including the use cases for their products, the diversity of their Audience and how they leverage partners.

{"prompt":"DAMASO\n43:51 \nThey are using Docebo top to bottom. It doesn't matter if you're the CEO or someone who's out there in one of the manufacturing sites or someone who's like a dealer, they use Docebo for a number of different reasons. So, in any case, I thought just giving kind of the similarity of the industry and the use case, it would be great to be able too connect you with them if you wanted to have a discussion just to kinda get that additional point of view from how they're using their experience with Docebo. They actually just recently expanded again just as recently as yesterday. So that's why I wanted to reach out to them today. He was supposed to catch up with them today. He said that meeting got cancelled because someone was sick or something like that. But anyways, I asked them, like do you think that they would be open to serving as a reference to connect with you?\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n44:34 \nHe said maybe not because they don't want, they, they've served as a happy reference for us many times. The only issue is that there have been problems in the past where they have refused to serve as a customer reference because of a potential conflict of interest depending on the industry that we want to connect our, I guess someone in your position with, right?\nSmall Talk\nDAMASO\n44:56 \nSo I told him a little bit more about kind of like where… rain, I'm thinking of like a different law firm that I'm working at. But anyways, race line and associates, not a law firm… that's something that I had brought up to him as far as like what it is you all do.\nAbout Docebo\nDAMASO\n45:15 \nI don't know if from your perspective, if you think that there would be a potential conflict of interest, or I also told him like there might even be situations where either you all or somehow affiliate in some way either in a partner capacity, customers, vendors, something like that. I don't know if that's something that you would be aware of who would be able to disclose?\nJESSICA\n45:35 \nI can't think of, I mean, off the top of my head, I can't think of that over. I mean, because our bread and butter is can canning industry. So.\nDAMASO\n45:44 \nMotors we use are…\nJESSICA\n45:46 \nCompletely different than motors. They.\nDAMASO\n45:48 \nYeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. So that's what I was thinking. So I mean, I don't know maybe you use some of the products like out there if you're building a new site or something like that.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAMASO\n45:57 \nBut anyway, it's just something that I was thinking about. So in any case, I hope to hear back from him whenever that meeting gets rescheduled. He said he's gonna reach out to them the email later today, but they are a little touchy about like industry use cases or industry a, Jason. So if that doesn't work out at the very least, you can mention them by name as like massive reputable, you know, brands out there that's using us for a number of different use cases, ones that you all are currently thinking about utilizing short term and then also in different enterprise ways.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n46:26 \nThat kind of span what you could think about getting into down the road. So I'll keep you posted on that. But with just one while we're on the customer side of things, let's see going back down some of the slides. So I did include a couple of slides with regards to onboarding. This is actually pulling from some of the information that staff had showed us earlier this week. So kinda talk about like the doc blue advantage like who the global Professional services board is, the time line that's associated with. That. One thing that I thought might be helpful for you too as a reference to share with your team is one potential scope of project roles and responsibilities and how much time might be required from folks filling these roles.\nOnboarding ends\nDAMASO\n47:09 \nSo project sponsor, LMS, admin, be someone like yourself, you know, stakeholders from different departments. A lot of these are kind of can be quantified more as like an as needed basis. Sometimes you don't always need your marketing and branding folks. Sometimes you don't always need as heavy it involvement as some other customers of ours do, right?\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n47:27 \nSo those are kind of discretionary, but I thought it might be helpful just to give you at least an estimate and you can work your way off that. So that I thought was helpful. The next piece that I pulled from was a project resources that you expect from the team more just roles and responsibilities. The top three roles that you see there from Docebo are going to be who is going to be assigned to you as a part of the traditional standard gold launch pack which is what we had initially recommended. There are additional options outside of the services component that is included, the information that I shared with you in that email from earlier this week, there are additional kind of more resources you could tap into if you want. A technical deployment manager that's really just reserved for folks who are very integration heavy with the number. Let's call it unique use cases that require technical support. Maybe they don't have the resources from their it folks to be able to do some of that stuff. An additional project manager too. So having someone service your quarter back to help, you know, he take communications, you know, make sure calls are being scheduled. The right people are looped in at the right time and so on, right? More details on what that person could do for you there also. And then just more of what we talked about with step on Monday, just a hands on configuration support. And so on. So, was this part of it as it relates to services and onboarding and support expectations? Did this kind of match up with what you were thinking, you're hoping for?\nJESSICA\n48:54 \nYes. Two questions. One, the quote that you gave me this week, the technical deployment manager, is that also the same person that would handle? Is that different than the contracted role that you sent me? Hold on? Let me find…\nDAMASO\n49:10 \nWords…\nJESSICA\n49:11 \nTo make sure I'm using the right words?\nDAMASO\n49:13 \nYeah, because I do wanna call out without having the email in front of me and remembering off the top of my head, there is the solution deployment manager. Now that that's already included, the technical deployment manager is different.\nJESSICA\n49:26 \nSo, the hands on configuration support, would they take the role of the technical deployment manager? Is that what that is it says?\nNotifications\nDAMASO\n49:34 \nWe're referencing the email that I sent earlier this week?\nJESSICA\n49:37 \nYeah, on Tuesday at.\nDAMASO\n49:39 \nGive me one second.\nJESSICA\n49:41 \nI said consultant project manager, system administrator. Yeah. Is that the same thing as the technical deployment manager or those different functions?\nDAMASO\n49:52 \nYeah. I'm pulling up the email here. I'm just waiting for my slow Inbox to catch up with me.\nNotifications ends\nDAMASO\n49:59 \nI will say that while I'm waiting on this to pull up the email, those additional product resources, those are not limited to the only things that we have available. So there might be some other stuff to that you might or that we might have available in terms of additional roles or types of people that you can work with.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n50:18 \nLet's see. So dedicated senior systems admin. So the senior system admin, that technically would be a different role that could be filled in. And sometimes it's kind of a blend between like sometimes people have dual purpose. Like sometimes a technical deployment manager can sometimes fill in as a senior systems admin to hang on hand on configuration support. That would be someone that would likely come from like either the project management team on our end or someone who might be an additional resource either from the STM solution deployment manager or the technical deployment manager team. So that one can vary as far as who exactly might be tapped in. It normally just depends on the complexity of the use case and what the ask is.\nJESSICA\n51:02 \nSo I'm referring to though the assigned team lead serves as consultant, project manager, system and project manager, system administrator. So they will not do any of the functions of the technical deployment manager.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso shared with the customer details about onboarding process, roles and responsibilities required and potential conflicts of interest depending on the industry.\n• The technical deployment manager role was discussed for customers who have complex use cases and need technical support.\n• Damaso suggested assigning a team lead to serve as consultant, project manager and system administrator. END"}
{"prompt":"DAMASO\n51:16 \nSo the technical deployment manager is more for back end configuration setup, meaning like if you want to set up your like data feeds between two systems that are, you know, Docebo and another system, right?\nIntegrations\nDAMASO\n51:31 \nThey would assist you in the actual kind of hands on technical support of setting that, you know, API up. In other words, that's a basic example, the hands on configuration support is more, it's also on the back end, what I was just talking about is the technical stuff kind of sinking with other outside the sources.\nLayout & Content\nDAMASO\n51:51 \nThe back ends from an admin point of view is what the hands on configuration support might be. So helping you with the more administrative functions in terms of user management, course management, assisting with your branding configuration, as terms of page design and things like that. That's more what we mean when it comes to the hands on.\nLayout & Content ends\nJESSICA\n52:10 \nCan you send me a quote for technical deployment manager?\nDAMASO\n52:15 \nI guess my only question is where would you foresee yourself possibly needing one? Because I have to, when I go and make those requests? They ask me like exactly what the ask is and where you, the customer fore sees themselves needing something like that because they want to assess. Is that something we actually need? Because we don't want to sell you more what you might need but also confirm invalidate whether or not the use case is actually something that they would accept?\nJESSICA\n52:39 \nI'm just trying to anticipate any questions from it. So technical, I mean we have a full it department is that when you normally do implementations do they normally is that the kind of standard protocol?\nIntegrations\nDAMASO\n52:50 \nWhen a technical deployment manager is required or requested, it is usually because either you have someone… it's either because you either have it resources that don't have experience setting up the integrations and the feeds between existing systems in your text stack that's reason number one or reason number two.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n53:09 \nOr it could be a combination of both would be if they don't simply have the time to be able to, you know, have someone assigned to this project from the it team to help support it and do all those core?\nJESSICA\n53:22 \nOkay. Yeah. I would still be curious to, for cost because I think that would be an instant question. I would get.\nDAMASO\n53:32 \nSounds good. I'll ask Steph about that. No previous to that information, but I'll ask her to see… what information can be provided with regards to contracting a technical deployment manager, have that included as part of?\nJESSICA\n53:47 \nYeah, I think in terms of the other thing just in terms of help is that people will want to know about like day to day help like, okay.\nOnboarding ends\nJESSICA\n53:54 \nSo I got locked out on my account. I emailed Jessica. I actually have like a separate email that funnels into mine.\nDAMASO\n54:02 \nActually use the help desk so that well, you don't have to be the help desk, right? In that situation, there's the help desk whereas someone needs to just have quick support… to reset their password. Just like the most common thing that happens that's something that you can either have them leverage the help desk for or again, it could be a situation where you can go in a proxy and in that user reset their password for them as well. So.\nOnboarding\nJESSICA\n54:26 \nI think, but I think that's what they're gonna wanna see the help desk for everyday user type items.\nDAMASO\n54:30 \nYeah. I have a slide for that talks about the additional resources that you receive outside of what's listed here or the options you have available that's really think of this as like live resource support. The other options are considered more just supplementary support. So the help desk, right? The customer experience team, the Shape university do Shape community and so on, right? Those are kinda the additional options in the knowledge base. Of course. So the additional resources that are available to you in addition to the live assigned folks you're gonna be working out. So I have a slide specifically for that. So I'll include that in here too.\nOnboarding ends\nJESSICA\n55:10 \nOkay, cool.\nDAMASO\n55:13 \nYeah, awesome. And one thing to someone who I was talking to yesterday might have been my new VP or one of the other managers, but we're talking about your projects and I kinda let them know the situation about how you're now a team of one. Again, one thing that they suggested and it's something that I wasn't I kind a new inherently but I guess I never really actually recognized it.\nOnboarding\nDAMASO\n55:37 \nBut when it comes to additional resource support that you all might see in terms of I'm talking like hiring now. So if you wanted to back fill positions or think about expanding the team and so on, I don't know how much of priority or what timelines you all might have for, you know, helping you not be that team of one for much longer, right?\nCoach & Share\nDAMASO\n55:57 \nIn any case in the Docebo Community, which again is our customer form where our Docebo experts and Docebo customers engage with one another and have that form community section together. There's actually a section by which you could actually post job listings as well. So you could tap into other resources, you know, list, you're posting right to include the job description and so on. And then you could actually leverage that to then find specific folks who might have to experience that might be interested in the role. So one thing that I thought was interesting that I thought it was an idea I could send you the link to that I can see if I actually have because I know I had it opened up but I'm one of those people that has like ability to open.\nCoach & Share ends\nJESSICA\n56:43 \nYou're a tab person? My?\nDAMASO\n56:46 \nLook at my VP. So I have a new VP that I'm reporting on into now and I had a team meeting with him yesterday. I saw his screen for the first time and I thought I was bad, but like you can't even with his, like you can't even like see what like the tab is there's just so many, you know? So I don't know.\nJESSICA\n57:06 \nThat's funny. We all.\nDAMASO\n57:09 \nIt's kinda one of those things like geniuses have tended to be the more messy ones, you know, but they know exactly where everything is.\nJESSICA\n57:16 \nI had to go through somebody's computer, two different people's computers the other day to pull files and it's incredibly insightful as to who a person is, how.\nDAMASO\n57:25 \nYeah, exactly. It's very telling, right?\nJESSICA\n57:27 \nYeah.\nDAMASO\n57:29 \nGive me one moment. I don't wanna take your time. I could find it to you and send it to you offline. So, but yeah, so I'll get to work. I have some time later today just to put some finishing touches, include some of the additional details that we had talked.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Damaso discussed a Technical Deployment Manager, which is responsible for setting up data feeds between systems and providing hands-on technical support with Integrations and Layout & Content.\n• Jessica asked for a quote for this service.

Hi.\nMATTHEW\n0:11 \nHi, Jenny.\nJENNIFER\n0:12 \nTime at we're spread all over.\nMATTHEW\n0:16 \nWe've been running from pillar to post this week.\nCELINA\n0:20 \nThe…\nMATTHEW\n0:21 \nState of Texas.\nVIDHI\n0:25 \nI had a hectic morning myself.\nVIDHI\n0:26 \nMy mom.\nVIDHI\n0:27 \nIs going to India today, and I drove her to the airport at eight a M, and then she got there and found out that the flight was delayed till one am. So then I went back to the airport, and so I've had a few rounds in the car.\nJENNIFER\n0:40 \nNo, wow.\nVIDHI\n0:45 \nA key.\nVIDHI\n0:50 \nWaiting on a few more people. Okay? How's everything been on the platform so far?\nJENNIFER\n0:58 \nLet me do my, I'm gonna start my video just because I feel weird because I do a lot of the lighting is weird in this room. I…\nMATTHEW\n1:04 \nMy gosh. It's so Bright it's burning my red.\nSmall Talk ends\nJENNIFER\n1:08 \nWell, we are in the church… not meeting… so platform… you know, trying, I'm learning every single day, something new that I just kinda didn't know because I guess I'm having to relearn a different way of doing things within LMS than the way we built the one that we use them. So it's a learning experience every day. Yeah, for sure.\nVIDHI\n1:38 \nAnd, and I'll say that it doesn't stop. I mean, I've been with the company for a year and a half. I'm always learning something new every day, you know, especially with any kind of enhancements that come out each month, there's something. And so, you know, I'll say that you're definitely doing better than you think more often than not.\nOnboarding\nJENNIFER\n1:58 \nSo, we'll see… what David gonna join or do we?\nVIDHI\n2:05 \nDavid actually is taking deserve time off, I think seeing it for a month. So it's just gonna be me today and I don't know if we talked about this but we had a little bit of internal restructuring reformatting of meetings where essentially I'll be your primary point of contact moving forward, David, still your account manager, but he's going to be more for the kind of commercial and subscription related stuff. And so conversations like this and generally, you know, monthly conversations that we have, I'm gonna host them. But Dave is, he's great. He's one of the kind of managers we have at the table that likes to be very involved with this client which is awesome. And so I'm not, you won't really notice much of a change.\nOnboarding ends\nVIDHI\n2:51 \nBasically. Okay. Yeah… awesome. I think we have everyone who are PDF in the call now. So I'm good to kinda maybe hear a little bit more about this. I did read your email, Jennifer and I totally, I get where you're coming from. I think you were looking more for kind of a consultant approach more of a best practice approach rather than a how to approach. Is that kinda?\nJENNIFER\n3:20 \nYes, I would say that. And I'm I guess I'm fine on the, how to, on something. But for me like the big things like the branch and that kind of stuff, things that are kinda your really your baseline for things. Yeah, I needed more of a like I just need you like really help me look at what we've got and help me what makes the, make the best decision. And that's where I was kinda struggling with all.\nMATTHEW\n3:44 \nYeah, Vidhi, I think we would like probably what we're looking for is a little more guidance and maybe some recommendations beyond just what the options are. We can see the options. But like she alluded to earlier or is built, it's quite a bit different. So we're trying to wrap our head around that. So sometimes we just need somebody to say, hey, this is what we recommend based on your situation.\nVIDHI\n4:13 \nTotally, totally makes sense. And I'm happy to be that kind of more strategic consultant that not funds for you. I know Dave wanted to talk to you more about your implementation experience. But for me, I kinda wanna look at what I can do to just make your life easier in Docebo. And so tell me more about your Organizational structure. I guess how are the Branches and groups currently set up?\nBranches & Groups\nMATTHEW\n4:37 \nSo do you, while you talk, I'm gonna share the screen or we talked about. So go ahead.\nJENNIFER\n4:43 \nYes. Okay. Yeah. Our fancy drawings there. So, so in our current LMS, we really do very much of an org chart type structure. And when we started plotting this out and, you know, call, saying they really people don't need to be in multiple Branches. It just so we set it up a little bit differently than even what you see on the board here. So what I was noticing is that, so we have this usm United Supermarkets LLC over and so that holds everybody because that's your base. And then we had support in and we kinda had or we had anyway, we had a bunch of people under, but they were driving in the branch structure. They were driving this way through the branch. So they were essentially look like they were going to be over everybody else because of the way we had the Branches set up. And I mean, they don't want my 17,000 team members here and also here and also here until they finally end up in their bottom branch.\nBranches & Groups ends\nJENNIFER\n5:45 \nSo I guess it just really wasn't understanding. I, so this is when we kinda rework this, I guess sometime last week, trying to think well, if we just do this big bunch of us, then we have our whole, I guess our support was, so our corporate team and then have them on the same level as some of our other businesses.\nBranches & Groups\nJENNIFER\n6:03 \nSo our support team is all of our corporate folks. Our ct is essentially another form of business. There are a manufacturer, one of our manufacturing group, rates is another food manufacturing type group. And then no, is our actual distribution center, an admin, and then our stores. So, you know, normally what they're setup is just going to be who you report to, just that and the other in our current Organizational chart, but we just couldn't do that and have them in just one branch. So we're just sure how to tab people in just one branch, that other people aren't over everybody else. How does that work?\nVIDHI\n6:45 \nGood question. So, yes, you know, the way we usually and let me give my little spiel on Branches and groups before I go any further. So Branches are intended for a user to be in like a singular branch. And of course, they can be in the parent branch and then a sub branch to really narrow down really, however you want to categorize them, right? Based on their role based on their region. So on, so forth, you then also have the option to put your users into groups. And groups are much more dynamic. You can have these conditional fields that kinda automatically places users in different groups. So what I'm hearing is the way this is currently set up is essentially users kinda fall into two kinds of Branches, am I correct?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jennifer has been learning a new way to use LMS.\n• Jennifer was looking for more of a consultant approach, and Matthew remarked that they would appreciate more guidance.\n• Currently, users are setup in two kinds of Branches; one representing their role and the other their region. END"}
{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n7:31 \nNot necessarily, but I guess what, I guess where I would my confusion is let's say they're end up in that storage branch. Well, they're going to be in that storage branch. And then we're also going to have a department under them. So they're going to end up in the store and the department, is that right or no?\nVIDHI\n7:46 \nGreat. Yeah. So this is a good point. So we usually recommend kind of having one sense of logic for Branches and then anything else where you're like, well, yeah, they're in this kind of, you know, role, but also they have this very specific department that they're also in. I recommend using groups for that. Okay? So what I would suggest is if you have support or CP, and then the stores, when you say department, tell me what you mean by department.\nJENNIFER\n8:16 \nSo food service, bakery, which yeah, I actually have taken the time because of all this to figure out that I needed to create drop down elements, create make them a drop down additional fields and create all the, those elements.\nPricing\nJENNIFER\n8:34 \nWhich is a lot. I found out now that we have 618 job codes in our company. So, yeah. And so I've got to create 1,606 118 elements within that job code. Drop down essentially is kind of what I'm figuring out.\nVIDHI\n8:49 \nThat's amazing.\nPricing ends\nVIDHI\n8:50 \nAnd, you know, what with large clients like yourself, you know, this is kind of there's no real easy way, right? Because you're a big organization because there's complexity. It does tend to kinda sometimes happen that way. My good news for you is that work has absolutely not gone to wait.\nBranches & Groups\nVIDHI\n9:06 \nWhat I would recommend though is instead of putting that department logic into your Branches, I would actually put that into your group. Yeah. Yeah. And.\nJENNIFER\n9:15 \nThink, Matt, we talked about that, right? Is like I'll just do that with groups and we can get rid of all that. So we really essentially just need one level. Is that what you're saying? Like we have just get rid of that, an admin no, and then delete that department, all those departments?\nVIDHI\n9:28 \nExactly. I would get rid of the departments, but under stores, I would drill down a little bit deeper and maybe make sub Branches of the actual stores and you could even do stores, the branch region, sub branch store name. Okay? That makes sense. Or if you have a store number?\nJENNIFER\n9:44 \nOkay. So wouldn't they be in that stores and that sub branch or is that not two Branches that they?\nVIDHI\n9:51 \nSo that would be a sub brand. So here, let me see if I can show you. Is it okay if I click over screen share?\nMATTHEW\n9:57 \nYeah. Go ahead, biddy?\nSmall Talk\nVIDHI\n9:59 \nHi. And I don't have my additional screen today. So I'm being I'm a little bit lower than usual for…\nJENNIFER\n10:07 \nSame same here. I'm like I'm not sure how people work with one screen in their life.\nVIDHI\n10:12 \nWe don't know, I, I'm still spoiled now with, I used to be able to, okay?\nBranches & Groups\nVIDHI\n10:18 \nSo let's take a look. So I'm just going into user management just to give you an example. So let's say you have, you know, your one parent branch of LLC, I think it was. And then when we drill down further, you could, I mean, this is regional but you don't have to do that.\nBranches & Groups ends\nVIDHI\n10:34 \nYou can have support. You can have all the categories and stores, and then you can drill down further, you can even do by state or you can do it by region. You know, you would know how many stores would you say you have overall?\nJENNIFER\n10:48 \n100 is?\nVIDHI\n10:50 \n100 Ish.\nBranches & Groups\nVIDHI\n10:51 \nOkay. So I would, maybe, you know, do another branch of whatever level up it is. If it's by like northwest or something like that, and then again roll down further. And then your very last kind of branch, the last child branch should be each store name.\nJENNIFER\n11:06 \nOkay. Okay. Then I guess I did misunderstand then because I thought a branch and a sub branch were two different Branches essentially that they're in. But as long as they're just in one level, they can be in as many sub Branches. We can kinda granulate that absolutely. Okay.\nVIDHI\n11:23 \nNailed it. Yeah.\nBranches & Groups ends\nVIDHI\n11:25 \nSo.\nVIDHI\n11:25 \nIt's kinda like this umbrella, right? So your, us, M is one big umbrella. And then under that, you have another six and then under that, you can keep drilling down. So that means, and this is really cool when you do your content pushes and you have page layout because you can say that I want this entire branch to have this kind of homepage.\nBranches & Groups\nVIDHI\n11:45 \nAnd if the Branches stores, all the stores will have that homepage. But then you can say, well, I only want this store to get this type of training and you can still drill down and give only that very sub brand.\nJENNIFER\n11:57 \nThat kind of training.\nVIDHI\n12:00 \nAnd…\nVIDHI\n12:00 \nSo, I would say keep the logic of where should this user be? If this user is in a store, the deepest place we can put them here is which store exactly it support. Maybe there's different departments under support. And then for things like role or even, you know, department in each store, things like that, I would use that like that for groups. Yeah.\nMATTHEW\n12:24 \nVide, let me ask you one thing and that we had kinda gleaned with our com, Colin is that we want branch structure to, we'd like for, to be able to, I guess assign training. We want to structure how we assign training most of the time. And so I would say most of the time instead of by store, Jennifer will assign training more by department. Would you say that?\nJENNIFER\n12:56 \nYeah.\nMATTHEW\n12:58 \nThat case, would we want to structure department under stores with that being and then groups of score numbers for.\nJENNIFER\n13:12 \nNo, I think more with groups like vide said, I think those department will be groups which I've already created. I created additional field. I do it's yeah. Yeah. The only thing I have left Matt is like 300 of the 600 job codes. So, yeah, because there was like 80 departments. So I felt good about creating that as a group versus it being in the branch structure. I did. Sorry, Matt and I haven't caught back up and so I did a lot of that last week, Matt… but yeah, I think about group.\nIntegrations\nVIDHI\n13:48 \nAnd then I don't want it to seem like it's just kind of big overhaul. Are you, how are you currently moving users into the system and kinda editing any field.\nJENNIFER\n14:00 \nOkay. Yeah. So that, so let me bring that up. Roger and Salina that are on the call are actually handling that people. So they're just kinda listening in but they're working on that, setting up that feed between our HR system over so that it's pulling in. So she's working on that automated feed. But we are correct me if I'm wrong, gonna go to… Matt, what is it called? Are we doing an API for the feed eventually? What?\nMATTHEW\n14:28 \nYeah. So, and I and Roger yell feel free to jump in, but my understanding is at least the last discussion I guess we had with Lee is that we were, we're using the FTP initially and eventually we're working with bites and bits to get that set up to be an API call.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matthew and Roger are working on setting up a feed from an HR system via FTP, which will eventually be setup to be an API call.

Like how we're getting the?\nVIDHI\n14:57 \nExactly. Look, how are you provisioning users? And I'm just thinking, are you live in the system right now?\nJENNIFER\n15:04 \nNo.\nMATTHEW\n15:06 \nWell… yeah, we're in there working?\nJENNIFER\n15:11 \nBut we don't have, we are we fed team members into the sandbox, so we're getting that right first into the sandbox, yeah.

We've got to pull it all in place. So we do have a few users, but I think the most of them got deleted. I couldn't even find myself in this. You did get me into log in but I never could find any users. So we'll need to feed. So.\nBranches & Groups\nCELINA\n16:10 \nYeah, yeah. We removed them all because we also had the, we were gonna change the user name, possibly that we needed to test and… that was gonna be something we could just edit.\nVIDHI\n16:27 \nYeah, a little bit more of you're using like or something like that. It can be a little bit more technical to change that unique signifier. Are you comfortable so far with the kind of revamp of Branches and groups or is there anything else?\nJENNIFER\n16:45 \nNo, I think, Matt, you, okay? I think, I understand it now. I think my confusion was that if they're in stores, they can't be in sub Branches below that because they're in multiple Branches. I didn't that was the confusion for me. So I think I'm good now that I get it. They're not, and I think Matt kinda got that, but I was fighting them so.\nUser Permission\nMATTHEW\n17:04 \nYeah, no, that's good. So, and I'm sharing my screen again. So instead of department under stores will do all the stores is what were we landed? Jennifer?\nVIDHI\n17:12 \nYeah.\nJENNIFER\n17:13 \nYeah, most likely, yeah.\nVIDHI\n17:15 \nEven do it. Sorry, go ahead.\nMATTHEW\n17:19 \nNo, go ahead, biddy.\nVIDHI\n17:20 \nI was gonna say if you do, for example, have like a regional manager, someone who's in charge of all of the northeast or something like that, I would still have that location underneath doors just because then you can find them or Power user, and then they can just kinda report under that branch of all the stores that are in that region.\nUser Permission ends\nMATTHEW\n17:41 \nOkay. Go ahead.\nVIDHI\n17:43 \nAnd no, no. And I say this is how, you know, the organization structure is with managers and things like that. Definitely let me know and I maybe give some more invite.\nMATTHEW\n17:55 \nSo that sounds good. So, Jennifer, I guess we can offline that, but that does kind of transition into a question we have that's something we need to understand how we can solve for.\nBranches & Groups\nMATTHEW\n18:05 \nSo one thing that we do currently and, you know, looking at this branch structure, if we go this direction… one of the reasons we set our branch structure up the way we initially did is for reporting view? And so what we would like to do is I'm gonna give you an example here here.\nUser Permission\nMATTHEW\n18:28 \nSo like Jennifer is under the support branch, in this case, correct? So, Jennifer and lots of other people in the support branch may need to or will need to report or run reports on in the store branch or the no branch or the printers branch, since they're not hierarchical, is it possible to do that with Power user profile or to set them up to be able to view and run reports?\nBranches & Groups\nVIDHI\n19:01 \nAbsolutely. Yeah. I nailed it. So you had a really good point earlier to where you said we were thinking about how we want the content to be pushed out and, but also think about who should be reporting on it. We should have governance on this. And so, yes, you can give a Power user access to a sub branch, a sub branch or an entire branch so you can drill down and tailor that way.\nUser Permission\nMATTHEW\n19:26 \nOkay. And that's one thing and that's another great area that from our initial understanding is like we thought that in the way we have it structured now, Celina and Roger is, you know, based on the thinking that we have to have a hierarchical setup for reporting and things, but provided that somebody from a one branch can be set up as a Power user profile to view reports from a totally separate branch and we grant those Permissions, then I think this will work.\nJENNIFER\n20:04 \nYeah. And so we've got to talk through, we're not in to this point. Power user profiles have been a little bit of a strange thing for us if you will because in current elements that we're in, it's super easy. Like I just create a group and I give this group this profile and that's not the case I guess in the table. So we have to actually create this API. I guess if you wheel an IP where we tell it, who goes to, which Power user profile here?\nVIDHI\n20:40 \nIt is a more, I will say like you have more options profile, you should have to use API. You should be able to just do it within the system but you'll notice and this is where I find admin can get a little bit. And I've gotten that before as well. If you grant Power user permission over like a group of users, but then you would like them to also look at the courses. If user you want to have them report on the courses. You also have to give that Power user permission for courses.\nBranches & Groups\nVIDHI\n21:13 \nSo it isn't as straightforward as you have governance over this branch, you can see everything as Branches. You can really still block them from certain things. And this is good for our clients that have, you know, concerns or security concerns rather for visibility on certain things. But if you want to be able to say, well, everything for this branch, I can show you how to set that up. But… it is a different log in when you're calling from a different system.\nUser Permission\nMATTHEW\n21:43 \nSo vide on that note is and kind of in our reading and say our reading really Jennifer is reading, there's different options. So like if we give them view… Permissions within that Power user profile, that means they can run reports but they can't add users or do anything like that. Is that accurate?\nUser Permission ends\nVIDHI\n22:04 \nExactly. Yeah. And let me see. Maybe I can… my screen.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Vidhi discussed the structure of Branches & Groups and the need to provision users into the system.\n• Matthew shared his screen and explained how removing users from the system could be less intrusive than having them in it.\n• Jennifer clarified her confusion about sub-Branches, and Vidhi proposed assigning a Power user profile to view reports from multiple branches.\n• Matthew discussed granting view permissions within a Power user profile to run reports without adding or changing users. END"}
{"prompt":"MATTHEW\n22:24 \nSo in divide, I have a follow up question after you address this.\nVIDHI\n22:28 \nYeah, no, of course. So over here on a Permissions. Okay?\nJENNIFER\n22:39 \nHey, vdi, are you on air POS?\nVIDHI\n22:41 \nAnything I am, are you?\nJENNIFER\n22:43 \nSounds like they might be starting to dive. They're kind of bullet arbor.\nVIDHI\n22:46 \nOkay. Give me one moment, don't worry.\nVIDHI\n22:54 \nCan you hear me? Okay now?\nJENNIFER\n22:55 \nYeah, better.\nVIDHI\n22:56 \nMuch better. These aropots, I'm waiting for them to die. I've had them for four years and they're still not giant ready for.\nJENNIFER\n23:05 \nRight on.\nVIDHI\n23:08 \nSo, groups, and then, you know, you can like choose the groups sign… and then, you know what I think my?\nUser Permission\nVIDHI\n23:23 \nI was in the wrong spot. Sorry, you have to go into profiles and this is a really great example of a client that I helped the other day where we tried to create an API only permission and we added APIs, but then what ended up happening was the API calls had to do with users. And so it didn't look like it was working. We realized we not only had to give them API permission, but we also had to give them user Permissions. So it's kind of like whatever your Power user is connected to… whatever they should see whether it's courses or learning plans or enrollments, they do have to have some sort of permission to do with that.\nMATTHEW\n24:01 \nSo, if that permission was reports. So I saw you just passed reports there. So we just want the only Permissions we want this Power user profile to have is be able to view reports, then this would allow that, is that correct?\nVIDHI\n24:18 \nYou got it. And then they also I'm so sorry, could you repeat that one more time? Matt?\nCustom Reports\nMATTHEW\n24:24 \nAll right. Sorry, vide, will that allow a system wide or do you have to specify which reports they do have access to?\nVIDHI\n24:31 \nThe, which reports actually, you do within the reports area?\nMATTHEW\n24:36 \nOkay.\nVIDHI\n24:36 \nGood question. Yeah. So if you go into reports over here and you build a report, one of the questions that it will actually ask is.\nWrap-Up\nMATTHEW\n24:46 \nVisibility? Okay.\nVIDHI\n24:47 \nExactly.\nMATTHEW\n24:48 \nGotcha. Perfect. No, that's perfect. That's great. That helps a lot actually.\nJENNIFER\n24:55 \nIs essentially what we do right now? Okay?\nMATTHEW\n24:57 \nYeah. Okay. That's perfect. Really? Thank you.\nVIDHI\n24:59 \nNo problem.\nMATTHEW\n25:01 \nOkay. Let me ask my follow up question. Sorry, are you done? I don't wanna.\nVIDHI\n25:06 \nWell done. Yes.\nUser Permission\nJENNIFER\n25:07 \nMay start talker.\nMATTHEW\n25:08 \nAll right. Follow up question. So you mentioned that we don't necessarily have to use APIs to assign the Power user profile. So, this is our, and I say this is what Celina has built for our Automation at upload this Peru profile here, provided it's populated with a matching PU profile in Docebo, that will give them the correct Permissions. I'm assuming that accurate?\nUser Permission ends\nVIDHI\n25:43 \nYeah. Is this a template that you pulled from the system?\nMATTHEW\n25:47 \nYeah. So this is…\nJENNIFER\n25:48 \nOur…\nMATTHEW\n25:49 \nSystem plus all of our additional fields and really Salinas star who's done all the work on this. So, PU profile, we, currently, we don't have any setup. So we're leaving that blank because it was given some errors, but we've got level and so we would say our logic would be level equals Power user. And then we would assign the PU profile here. Celina, I'm assuming and tell me if I'm speaking out of turn, we could do some cross referencing in, you know, in the system saying if this job code then equals this Power user profile, correct? And then allow that to populate here. And then that could be the uploading FTP.\nUser Permission\nCELINA\n26:35 \nYes.\nMATTHEW\n26:36 \nOkay. And Vidhi, provided we do that and we have the matching P profile in Docebo, then that would allow us to not have to use APIs in that sense, correct?\nJENNIFER\n26:50 \nWhat if they're in, what if they're in multiple profiles to?\nMATTHEW\n26:54 \nWhat if they're in multiple profiles that's a good question?\nUser Permission ends\nVIDHI\n26:58 \nThen I think you would. And by the way, P profile to this field, was it already in the CSV or is this an additional field that you?\nMATTHEW\n27:07 \nThis was already in the CSV template? Is that accurate? I can't remember it's been a minute.\nJENNIFER\n27:13 \nI don't know that we just put that in there, so.\nCELINA\n27:15 \nYeah, I'm not.\nMATTHEW\n27:17 \nYeah… I think vide, I'm gonna go on record and say, yes, this was part of the scheme that we downloaded from a.\nVIDHI\n27:32 \nPerfect. Then I think a comma is usually when it's multiples, but I would test that out. Actually, no one's asked me that question before that's a good question.\nMATTHEW\n27:41 \nYou a comma? So some type of separate or it may be, so calling comma, something like that?\nVIDHI\n27:47 \nYeah, yeah. Usually, I know, I think it's comma, usually in our system.\nMATTHEW\n27:54 \nThat may kinda get messy with the logic. So, Selena, Jenny, maybe, do we… maybe we need to let's talk about Power user profiles and how we can best build those to encompass all the things we need to now that we know we can do that.\nUser Permission\nMATTHEW\n28:14 \nAnd now that we know we don't have to have an API and we can use Power user profiles per reporting. So let's, you and I hash that out. And then Selena will come to you with kind of what we wanna do. How about that?\nCELINA\n28:29 \nYeah, that sounds great.\nUser Permission ends\nMATTHEW\n28:32 \nOkay. But knowing that we can use Power user profiles for reporting and knowing that we don't have to have an API that we can do it through the FTP upload with some cross reference logic that gives us the foundation to build off of that we need. I feel good about this now. So better than I did 30 minutes ago.\nVIDHI\n28:59 \nAnd, and yeah, please feel free to, you know, like this is definitely not a one and done conversation as you work. If you want me to just look at what you've done in sandbox and get some final feedback before you do it in prod, I recommend it, you know, and we can have another call and I can kinda make.\nMATTHEW\n29:16 \nYeah, we will, I think once we kinda have that logic flushed out and then test it and get users in sandbox, we'd love to have you look it over perfect.\nJENNIFER\n29:29 \nQuestion, we can't we can copy down but we can't copy up. So I honestly did not do my drop down and create my 80 departments for additional fields.\nCourse Enrollment\nJENNIFER\n29:39 \nI did that in live because I would rather copy down than recreate it because we can't copy it. Is that ring?\nVIDHI\n29:48 \nWell, I guess actually if there's no live users in the system?\nJENNIFER\n29:53 \nRight.\nVIDHI\n29:54 \nYeah, absolutely.\nJENNIFER\n29:56 \nSo, I'd rather create in live. And then once I feel like I've gotten like the both of these things in, I would, we've done one copy down and I think they said we get how many a year I can't remember.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matthew asked about assigning Power User profiles and using APIs to do so.\n• Celina advised that a cross-referencing system with logic could be used in an FTP upload to assign the Power User profile. \n• Jennifer mentioned needing to create additional fields with departments if copying it down instead of up.  END"}
{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n30:09 \nSo I would like to try to get though because I have a lot more in live. Now, I have a lot more things built. I really would like a copy down at some point in the next probably month or.\nMATTHEW\n30:18 \nOkay. So we'll test it in live video, get you to verify once we get the logic built that, hey, this all looks good obviously.\nJENNIFER\n30:26 \nWithout…\nCELINA\n30:26 \nYou…\nMATTHEW\n30:27 \nHave live users. So it doesn't to your point, it doesn't really matter and then provided that all this checks out, then copy, do another copy down. Is that what you're suggesting?\nJENNIFER\n30:36 \nThat's what I would like to do.\nMATTHEW\n30:38 \nOkay. Cool. That sounds good.\nJENNIFER\n30:41 \nDo you know how many we get a year? Vide?\nVIDHI\n30:43 \nYear?\nJENNIFER\n30:44 \nFor? Okay, I thought it was too like we might be pushing it but it's been months since we had our other one. So that didn't have up in it yet.\nVIDHI\n30:52 \nYou know?\nVIDHI\n30:53 \nI think usually that tends to be good for.\nVIDHI\n30:55 \nFor our clients. So.\nJENNIFER\n30:56 \nOkay. Okay, great.\nROGER\n30:59 \nI have a question. Have we asked to, about that? The user name in employee number as opposed to email?\nJENNIFER\n31:12 \nNo, we do that.\nROGER\n31:14 \nOn that first.\nMATTHEW\n31:14 \nColumn. Yeah. So vide, on this first column, I'm gonna scroll over here. Is there, are there any limitations on user name? So for example… we've done, we would like to use team member number only for user name. So in this case, you know, the team member number would just be, the user name would just be one, right? We also have a field for team member number here. I feel like there was a reason we did that initially. But in your recommendation, is there any reason we can't use… the team member number four, user name that would simplify things for us quite a bit?\nVIDHI\n32:04 \nYou should be able to like simply change the user name here. How you'll do it in mass? I don't know off the top?\nMATTHEW\n32:12 \nIt'll…\nJENNIFER\n32:13 \nPull it'll, pull from our HR system.\nMATTHEW\n32:16 \nYeah. So we're good there, but is there any reason this can't just be just the remember number?\nVIDHI\n32:23 \nNo, no, there's no reason. And I would say if you want to also keep their email, just create a different, you know, email field. I think you should have it in the standard CSV if not, you can create that column. And yeah, you can, it can just be numerical. The only other thing I'm thinking of though is, do you intend for users to use SSO in the future like SAML, you just wanna make sure that on your identity providers back end, they have this user name too.\nMATTHEW\n32:49 \nYeah, that's where we were kinda getting into trouble and Roger this provider, we are able to use team member number for user name that will satisfy with ad, right?\nROGER\n33:00 \nYes, that's perfect. Because the issue that we're having with that SSO stuff is if someone change their… like you see there on the screen, we have this 53 or the at the Cid tough cloud, those aren't true email addresses.\nNotifications\nROGER\n33:21 \nSo we can't really email to that. But if they move that person's, probably at a store or something, I'm not sure where they work, but if they happen to move to a corporate position, then they'll get a true email address like online tin there, mark Stewart that's a true email address.\nNotifications ends\nROGER\n33:39 \nSo we are worried that if they're switching between a Cid account to a real email account, then it would mess up. We would orphan some records somewhere within the Docebo system. So having that having the user ID may maintain constant as their employee number, their employee number will never change if they terminate and come back to United. They will always be employee number 53. So… using the employee number for user name is would work great for us.\nVIDHI\n34:13 \nYeah. And that does tend to be a big push to why people change the signifier to a number. So, yeah, I would say you can definitely do it as long as that's a field also in your, I did a new provider when they are in the system.\nROGER\n34:28 \nYeah. And it is okay.\nMATTHEW\n34:32 \nSelena, Roger. Are we good to just go ahead and make that change then?\nROGER\n34:39 \nI would say yes, but I'd leave that to Celina. She's the one.\nCELINA\n34:43 \nYes, I can do that.\nMATTHEW\n34:45 \nAwesome. Thanks.\nJENNIFER\n34:46 \nThen we'll work, we'll rework the branch has information. We'll get those all set?\nMATTHEW\n34:52 \nSo, Celina. Yeah. Once Jennifer and I sit down and hash that out exactly how we want it. We'll just send you a meeting invite and go over that and you can yell at us and everything if you need.\nCELINA\n35:03 \nNo. Do we need to add a group? Would we need to add a group column to this CSV to upload users? Since I mean, I'm assuming you'll have some groups?\nBranches & Groups\nJENNIFER\n35:18 \nNo, I'll do that on group like the group I'll do in the.\nVIDHI\n35:24 \nYeah.\nCELINA\n35:24 \nYeah.\nVIDHI\n35:25 \nAutomatic group creation with additional field. So it'll actually, it'll kinda is like a CSV upload, but it's just within the UI.\nJENNIFER\n35:32 \nYeah, yeah. No. So you don't have to do anything with groups at all. I will, I'll create those, the requirements of additional fields, how they meet those. And then they'll just flow in there based on their additional fields. So.\nCELINA\n35:45 \nOkay. Well.\nJENNIFER\n35:46 \nThank you though for acting.\nCELINA\n35:47 \nTo be sure. Thank you.\nVIDHI\n35:49 \nYeah.\nMATTHEW\n35:50 \nIt shouldn't hopefully be blowing up too much of the work you've done.\nNext Steps\nCELINA\n35:55 \nI'm so.\nVIDHI\n35:56 \nSorry, I have a call at 12 that I have to jump for, please let me know when I can help again. And if you have any questions either via email or if you wanna book another call, let's do it. But, yeah, you're definitely on the right track. It's gonna look.\nWrap-Up\nMATTHEW\n36:10 \nAwesome.

That would be much appreciated. We're a very good looking group as you… but very camera shy. All right. Just for the introductions. I would like to see if we could get as much, you know?\nSmall Talk\nMATTHEW\n4:29 \nOf course, of course.\nJEANNIE\n4:31 \nSo, yeah. So first of all, I noticed in your emails, you called us there's. Mike. Good morning, sir. You referred to us as Berg, but we are Breg.\nMATTHEW\n4:46 \nOkay. Okay.\nJEANNIE\n4:47 \nHi, Naomi. Good morning. Yeah. So that's a common… thing. So, I just wanted to kinda do a little clerical issue.\nSmall Talk ends\nMATTHEW\n4:57 \nAwesome. You know what? I won't make that error again. And I actually came across that error when I searched Berg and I'm like they do military equip.\nJEANNIE\n5:05 \nI met. So at.\nMATTHEW\n5:06 \nFirst, I was looking at the wrong company. I'm glad you brought that up, but yes, I caught that myself too.\nJEANNIE\n5:12 \nYeah.\nMATTHEW\n5:13 \nI was researching you guys. So, thank you.\nJEANNIE\n5:16 \nYeah.

So we have certain requirements from the regulatory side and compliance side being in healthcare for assigning monitoring document, in training, of course. And so we also have a large portion of our LMS which is used for training of our Salesforce, which is what Mike is really our specialist in. And then we also leverage the LMS just to provide educational opportunities for our business associates throughout on core required elements and then other opportunities which could be like continued education or how to, you know, sales ships and so on. So that's just a little bit about us. And so yeah, we are, I'm not sure where you read the information but we are going through a little bit an Organizational change. Our headquarters is in carlsbad California.\nMATTHEW\n6:59 \nOkay. Yeah.\nJEANNIE\n7:00 \nWhere we currently have a distribution center, and we're really relocating the distribution activities to ethically, where our manufacturing center of excellence. Cool. And we have another distribution center in Indianapolis. So we have a lot of moving pieces right now.\nMATTHEW\n7:20 \nYeah. And you know what? That explains your employees size too. You guys are big. You got a lot of different locations and I know when you're doing medical devices that's got to be manufactured at the highest standards possible. I, and also you mentioned the compliance trading and all that. So I can definitely see how your use case fits into your business. And I'm gonna learn a lot more to as I work with you guys for sure. I'm gonna learn a lot more. So today's call was basically introductions me introducing yourself. I am going to be your acting manager moving forward. So if you ever want to explore, does you know we offer a whole ecosystem of software products?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeannie and Matthew discussed onboarding, the LMS package they purchased, as well as their business' growth in Mexico.\n• They discussed pricing with Jeannie confirming the details of their purchase.\n• Jeannie gave a brief overview of Breg’s business activities, mentioning that they have a distribution center in California and Indiana, manufacturing centers, and specialized Salesforce training with the LMS.\n END"}
{"prompt":"MATTHEW\n7:59 \nIf you ever want to explore any additional products to really launch your LMS and get the most from it? You mentioned, Mike, you're the Salesforce guru. Have you guys ever thought about injecting, no, have… no. What was it that you said that?\nMICHAEL\n8:15 \nThe Salesforce but not Salesforce is a platform.\nMATTHEW\n8:18 \nNot Salesforce as a platform. Okay? I know one thing we do offer and I just leverage it to a client that wants to expand learning to their partners and their partners employees. Was the Salesforce app injecting do directly into Salesforce. I don't know if that's ever an interest, but like we have a whole ton of products and if you guys ever wanna talk about some products to grow.\nIntegrations ends\nMICHAEL\n8:40 \nWe don't use, we don't use Salesforce at all.\nMATTHEW\n8:42 \nYou don't use it at all? Well, then?\nMICHAEL\n8:44 \nThat's something we won't talk about that. Yeah, that will save you a little bit of time that…\nMATTHEW\n8:48 \nIs a little bit of time, but, you know, what, if you ever see anything you wanna talk, better reach out to me if you ever think, hey, Matt, you know what? We're not getting the type of engagement we wanna get from our LMS, reach out to me, we can strategize, we can talk about solutions. I've seen other people deploy to increase that, whatever it might be, please reach out to me if you ever come across any technical questions. So like in platform, how do I set up my reporting to function the way I wanted to? Those would be questions that I'm gonna have to direct you guys to chat support. They're going to be the best to handle that. If you ever find that you might not be getting the responses you want or time's kinda slow, send me a message.\nOnboarding\nMATTHEW\n9:32 \nI'll be your quarter back there and making sure we get the answers to you. Another thing we also offer if you do run into any snags with the platform, is we just recently rolled out a Professional services department where we can pair you one on one with a technical expert to walkthrough any issues you might be having.\nAbout Docebo\nMATTHEW\n9:49 \nKeep in mind, it's kind of a it's out of paid service kind of like when you get a car and you got your manufacturers warranty on it, you will bring it in for an oil change. You got to pay for those services with Professional services, we can help you out to add a fee, but I'm happy to discuss that. If we ever need to get there.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJEANNIE\n10:06 \nIt's okay, great.\nMATTHEW\n10:09 \nSo, what else did you want to bring to my attention? Like right now 2023 it's coming up, you're talking about Growth? Is there anything new we're going to be doing with the platform this year or are we kinda using it status quo as we intend it to or are we just really trying to use it how we originally intended to right now? Where are we at and going into 2023…\nOnboarding\nJEANNIE\n10:32 \nWell, I can try to field that question. So when we made our transition from a prior LMS to Docebo, it was a long journey. We started this journey in November of 2021 after we learned that our other LMS was really gonna be sunsetted. And so we formed a group cross functional team and we went through the whole vendor selection process.\nOnboarding ends\nJEANNIE\n11:03 \nWe narrowed it down. We met with a number of colleagues from different vendors including Docebo. And, you know, we finally made the decision around this time last year. And so then we started our onboarding process and, you know… it was interesting, you know? So we had to kind of, you know, learn a lot in a short amount of time and we had a dead set, go live date because the other one was sunsetting, right? Absolutely no longer available. So we did everything we could to try to leverage. We did a big migration using the help with Anne. I forget her last name, but she was super helpful. We did a huge migration from the old LMS to the new. We can some pages we created like one catalog which is a library that contains all of our yep course content, imported, our users set up our enrollment rules… and we went live and it's been fairly successful. And, you know, we still have some users that have yet to sign in. But that's not a problem that's a big issue. So, I think at this point, what we're what we'd like to do in my focus for the first half of the year is to continue to leverage some of the functionalities to enhance the user experience. You find any efficiencies related to the admin experience. So a few of those things that we're going to be deploying and we're going to be tracking and launching a project for us, creating separate catalogs based upon course content. For example, product training… let's say sales tips and tricks, Professional development, you know, how to make the best powerpoint presentation in the world.\nIntegrations\nJEANNIE\n13:15 \nOther things like we have a whole portion of our business that's focused on insurance billing related to our products. Instead of just having one giant library. We jumped all 400 learning all courses. And so it's not very navigation…\nMATTHEW\n13:35 \nYou want to streamline it and make it easier to access learning?\nIntegrations ends\nMATTHEW\n13:39 \nHave you ever thought of doing that using channels as opposed to catalogues? I can show you what I mean by that if you want.\nJEANNIE\n13:49 \nLet me take a note. Well, I can, so channels or catalogs. Another thing we're going to be using is we're gonna deploy some versioning. So we have a lot of… let's call them standard operating procedures that are regularly updated and released. And right now, what we're doing is we're creating a whole new core shell loading in the revised content and then deploying that. And it's kind of muddying up the user accounts because we have multiple versions of the same sop, but, you know, there's slight differences.\nBranches & Groups\nJEANNIE\n14:32 \nOkay? So we're gonna deploy some versioning that's something that we're also looking into as well as cleaning out some more user accounts based upon feedback from the leadership team on what is really needed for these job roles. So for each of our job titles, we've created a group… that's how we manage it. So we have tons of groups because we have this obscene amount of job titles within our organization. Okay? And then we've created these enrollment rules, right? So if you come in and you're a new… you know, credit specialist, you're automatically assigned those courses which is really great efficiencies for us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matthew and Michael discussed Salesforce integrations and professional services as additional products to launch their LMS.\n• Jeannie explained the journey transitioning from a prior LMS to Docebo, included performing a migration, setting up enrollment rules, and going live.\n• With 2023 coming up, their focus for the first half of the year is to leverage existing functionalities to improve user experience and admin efficiency.\n• This includes creating separate catalogs based on course content and versioning for SOPs.\n• They are cleaning out user accounts according to feedback from leadership and have created groups with enrollment rules for each job title. END"}
{"prompt":"JEANNIE\n15:18 \nAnd we do have an API connection between our UK G HR System, okay, and Docebo, which also added an incredible amount of efficiency. So new users automatically going in, we have a minor glitch with our terminated users being inactivated, but I think that has to do with our API. We're using, we need to leverage our internal it resource.\nMATTHEW\n15:43 \nYep. I was actually just talking with somebody today about KG integrations with Docebo. So I'm glad you mentioned that and I'm glad it's working well for you guys because yeah, let's avoid data enter if we can, right? Let's make it simple seamless, let's get it right in there. Yeah.\nIntegrations ends\nJEANNIE\n16:00 \nAnd so anything else that we can do this, you know, to increase engagement? I know there's a lot of features that we're not currently using because we just kinda scratch and cloud to go live. Yeah, you honest.\nMATTHEW\n16:17 \nOf course. Yeah. What about, like first thing that comes to mind when you say learner experience getting engagement on is it's an easy one. Gamification, have you guys leverage the gamification? Because that's built right into your platform right now? That's not even at an additional cost, you got access to that gamification, having leader boards having badges offering incentives for people to engage in content like that really gets people's hearts going and gets them in there using it. I've seen a lot of success with that. If you want. I can send you some good links on gamification.\nJEANNIE\n16:52 \nI mean, sure that I think there's certain portions of our business that would benefit from that. Others maybe wouldn't… care if they were on a leader board to be quite a.\nMICHAEL\n17:05 \nMatthew here's, one of the challenges for our Salesforce that we're pumping this out to is a big chunk of the users. A lot of them are independent and, okay. So, there's not a lot of drive to reach the top of board within the company because they really don't care. It's their business. They're worried about, not the Breg business.\nMATTHEW\n17:27 \nGotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. And for that Audience of people, maybe it wouldn't have a result, you know what?\nMobile App\nMATTHEW\n17:32 \nI'm not really a video gamer. I don't get too excited about it, but I know when I was a new employee here, I saw I was top of the charts for my mobile usage and I'm like sweet, well, I get a shirt for that. So there's always some people that might gravitate towards it. Other people that might not. I mentioned mobile app. You guys have access to the free go learn mobile?\nJEANNIE\n17:55 \nI do use that and I think we've deployed that we set that, those pages up. And I do think might confirm we do have users using it on mobile. I've never done it. I'm a kind of a desk lady.\nMATTHEW\n18:10 \nThere's differences all.\nJEANNIE\n18:11 \nAround.\nMATTHEW\n18:12 \nYeah, but would just make those different options available? Yeah.\nWrap-Up\nJEANNIE\n18:18 \nSo, yeah, I mean, those are just a few things that we're looking at. And Maria was really great. She sent us a lot of information on catalogs because we had this conversation with her as well as she sent us materials on versioning… and so that's kind of a little bit about our use case and like where we are now. Yes. Yeah.\nMATTHEW\n18:43 \nWell, you know what? It sounds like? You guys are in a good spot. It sounds like there's still some things you need to work on to get it working as efficiently as possible, but it sounds like you're at a good spot right now to keep going with what you're going with.\nIntegrations\nMATTHEW\n18:58 \nIf you ever are looking for any other ways to expand. Like another conversation I had was nowadays we see businesses using multiple different tech stack data is king, if you guys ever wanted to explore ways to connect your tech stack to together that's even more advanced than the Automation app, that are you using the Automation app with ukg right now for that one way? Yeah. So that will do a one way link of data. If you ever want information to flow from Docebo into some other databases. We offer a product called connect to really allow your systems to talk to one another. So there's a lot we can do. And if you guys are looking to grow or say data is something that's important to you, we can have those conversations.\nNext Steps\nJEANNIE\n19:45 \nOkay. All right. So what do you see like… our connection cadence? Like do we, can we put like a monthly meeting on the calendar with the team going forward or do you just play it by ear? Because with Maria, we kind of we have penciled in like I was like the third Thursday of every month.\nMATTHEW\n20:08 \nYeah. The third Thursday, if you guys wanna do that, I am very happy to set that up. I like connecting with my team but I just want to ensure like I've done them before and sometimes they turn into hi, what are we talking about today? Nothing? And then it becomes kind of a waste of time for both people. I don't want it to get to that. If there's value in having a monthly cadence, let's set it up but let's make sure we're prepared every time.\nJEANNIE\n20:33 \nI agree. And so my ask to the team would be to come to those meetings with topics and even the even better to send them in advance so you could be prepared because your time is valuable. All of us are super busy as well and, you know, you might think it's only a half an hour of the day once a month, but hey, there's a lot that's going on, of course. So, I completely hear you on that and I wanna make sure that the time is value added.\nOnboarding\nJEANNIE\n21:04 \nBut as we kind of transition to this new relationship, yep, I would like to at least put, you know, some on the calendar and then I'll help guide the team in advance to make sure that we're prepared for that. And if not, we can let you know in advance to go ahead and move this off.\nNext Steps\nMATTHEW\n21:21 \nYeah, exactly. And no harm. No foul. If we have nothing to talk about, you know, what? That's a good thing too. It means things are working. But, yeah, why don't we pencil something in there right now and I'll set it up as a monthly cadence?\nJEANNIE\n21:34 \nOkay.\nMATTHEW\n21:34 \nI'm just gonna pull my calendar opening. You said you were doing it with Mariah, the last Thursday of every month?\nJEANNIE\n21:40 \nLike a Thursday every month, it was, I mean, it can be the last Thursday, I don't know.\nMATTHEW\n21:48 \nYeah. Well, whatever works best for you guys. Like I'm looking into March right now. Let me tell you my calendar is pretty wide open near the end of March right now.\nSmall Talk\nJEANNIE\n21:57 \nOkay. Yeah. Trying to get this computer to work. Yeah, go ahead. And like, so you're on east coast, right?\nMATTHEW\n22:09 \nYeah, I'm actually located in London, ontario, Canada, about two hours from Toronto.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeannie and Matthew discussed integrating Docebo with UKG HR System and leveraging internal IT resources.\n• Matthew suggested that Jeannie consider gamification to increase user engagement, and offered links for further information.\n• Jeannie reported that some users were not motivated by leaderboards, so Matthew recommended incentives like rewards or mobile app usage.\n• They agreed to set up a regular cadence of meetings in order to ensure that the time spent together was value added.

{"prompt":"JEANNIE\n22:14 \nYou're even in a different country?\nMATTHEW\n22:17 \nYeah, no, we're getting snowed in here today. I got my sweater on. I gotta go shovel the driveway. Where are you guys again? I know you set it, but where are you located again?\nJEANNIE\n22:29 \nWe're in carlsbad California, sunny, southern California.\nMATTHEW\n22:33 \nYou guys are lucky?\nJEANNIE\n22:35 \nIs it hot?\nMATTHEW\n22:36 \nRight now, have you?\nJEANNIE\n22:38 \nAnd rainy.\nMATTHEW\n22:39 \nOkay. Okay. So, I was talking to some people down in Texas and they were saying, you know, what? It's abnormally hot right now down here and it's cold here. I don't I…\nJEANNIE\n22:51 \nYou know, a couple of weeks ago, they were having like ice storm. So, who?\nMATTHEW\n22:54 \nThe weather's crazy.\nJEANNIE\n22:58 \nSo, what is your time difference if on entry are?\nMATTHEW\n23:01 \nI am right now, it is almost 12 o'clock…\nJEANNIE\n23:06 \nAll right. Okay. So, you are…\nMATTHEW\n23:07 \nEastern standard. Okay. So you guys it's earlier there right now?\nNext Steps\nJEANNIE\n23:12 \nYeah. So we're gonna hit nine soon. So we were thinking, yeah, like this Thursday a month and we would generally meet around like 10 30 our time, which.\nMATTHEW\n23:24 \n30 your time on two, three, one 30 my time.\nJEANNIE\n23:29 \nYeah, but does that look like a feasible?\nMATTHEW\n23:33 \nYeah. Yeah. Right now, my calendar is completely open and we'll make this reoccurring so that it's always your slot right now. I just got it on Thursday, the 20 third at one 30 and I'm just gonna book a half an hour for us as a catch up if send me an Agenda ahead of time. If we need more time and I can make that available. I'll add an extra half hour to it if need be.\nNext Steps ends\nJEANNIE\n23:56 \nOkay. Have you had a chance to go into our platform and?\nMATTHEW\n24:00 \nI have not taken a look around your platform yet. I didn't and if you, we got some, well, we don't really have too much time right now, but I can poke around in it and take a look. But me looking around in the platform. Now that I've talked to you, it will make a lot more sense than it would if I just logged. Okay. So let me take a peek. And another thing we do offer and I don't know if you guys would be interested or if Maria even mentioned it when you were working with her is Docebo is offering scorecard reviews. It's a value add to your membership that can be used once a year, where I bring in a customer solutions manager, we evaluate your platform. We tell you what areas you think we're doing, you're doing well in areas we could improve. If you haven't touched gamification, that would be one thing that maybe we could see an improvement on. But we do a scorecard review to let you guys know where you stand. Do you think moving forward together, it might be advantageous to set something like that?\nJEANNIE\n24:59 \nI mean, you said that's included in our membership?\nMATTHEW\n25:02 \nYeah, it's a value add. You get access to it once a year. Some members like using it, you know, what? Matt right before our renewal, let's dive in and take a look at it or, you know, what Matt new year, we're rolling out some new initiatives. Let's take a look at it right now. So whenever you wanna take advantage of it, it's there for you. I just wanted to bring that up as an option you have at your fingertips.\nJEANNIE\n25:24 \nOkay. That's good. I didn't know that was available. And the other thing we have is we have a, we have a sandbox environment.\nMATTHEW\n25:33 \nI saw that. Yeah.\nJEANNIE\n25:34 \nThat's refreshed quarterly. So we got it. I think we were refreshed at the beginning of January or late December. Okay. So, will you be handling like that cadence going forward? Because Mariah just kinda said like, are you guys ready to refresh? And like, yeah, it's time.\nMATTHEW\n25:55 \nThink that's something I can easily do in my ERP, I have not done one before. So I'm gonna have to reach out to my manager to see the exact cadence. But if Maria was doing it for you in the past, I believe I have access.\nJEANNIE\n26:08 \nShe would kinda be like the reminder of us like, okay, you know, and then she would reach out to her, you know, of course, she would put in the ticket and then let us know. Okay, you guys are ready to go. And then we would know that it's been refreshed.\nMATTHEW\n26:25 \nYeah. Yeah. You know what? Let me reach out. I'll find the proper protocol for that also if you know, a dates coming up and I don't you send me a message saying, hey, Matt, can we refresh it? I'm happy to always refresh it?\nJEANNIE\n26:38 \nOkay, great. But.\nMATTHEW\n26:39 \nI'll figure out what Maria was doing on her end too.\nJEANNIE\n26:44 \nOkay.\nBRENDA\n26:44 \nWe, we plan on doing a lot more testing in our Inbox than we have. Was the whole reason why we got it was we wanted to be able to do some testing. So it's gonna be important. That is… I believe Maria said she recommended that we do it quarterly… and I don't remember, we wanted it to be more often, but I'm thinking maybe there was a cost associated with doing it more often than quarterly.\nMATTHEW\n27:21 \nThere may be, once you get into those frequent refreshes, let me find out exactly if Mariah told you there was a cost, Mariah wouldn't have lied to you. I would go with her answer.\nBRENDA\n27:33 \nYeah. Well, I'm trying to remember if that's why we, cause we wanted it more like monthly.\nMATTHEW\n27:39 \nOkay. Okay.\nBRENDA\n27:40 \nI'm trying to remember, do you recall or name, do you remember why it was gonna be quarterly?\nJEANNIE\n27:48 \nI think at first we asked her monthly and she said, well, honestly, you know, that that's a little that's too much. Basically, you know, her clients would do it quarterly and that seems to be more of a widely, you know, more of a general practice for those clients that have sandboxes is more of a quarterly refresh. And so we were like, yeah, okay. You know, let's do it quarterly. So.\nMATTHEW\n28:21 \nAnd I also know we're going to have our monthly cadences if wherever connecting you say, hey, Matt, we could use a refresh. I'm gonna find out if it's simple as me creating a ticket. I don't mind doing that. If there is an additional cost to doing like monthly refreshes, I'll find out the answer and exactly why that would have been advised. But if Maria said it, I wouldn't Mariah wouldn't lie to you either. Yeah.\nJEANNIE\n28:45 \nI…\nBRENDA\n28:45 \nThink would be too.\nJEANNIE\n28:46 \nMuch actually because… yeah, I mean, I have only been in the sandbox like once since the last refresh, but we are looking to do more, you know, this quarter and dive back in.\nMATTHEW\n29:00 \nYeah. Yep. And I know one thing that I constantly hear at Docebo test and retest make sure things are working and that's why you have the sandbox. It's great for doing that. Let's break things in a fake environment instead of our real life scenario.\nJEANNIE\n29:14 \nRight. So, could you send us like a, can I forget what she calls them? Like a cool, like little article on what is the difference between a channel and a catalog?\nBRENDA\n29:26 \nYeah.\nMATTHEW\n29:27 \nI can find some information for you.\nJEANNIE\n29:30 \nThat'd be great because we were thinking about going to catalog route, but I'm not that clear on channels.\nNext Steps\nJEANNIE\n29:41 \nAnd then you can set up the monthly meeting ladies. Is there anything else before we wrap up? Because they think we're out of time?\nBRENDA\n29:52 \nNot that I can think of.\nNEOMY\n29:54 \nYeah, I know. Okay, I'm sure we'll have plenty meeting.\nMATTHEW\n30:00 \nWe'll be meeting again, yes. And that's quite, all right. I like questions. It means you guys are working your butts off in the LMS. I like that. That's good to hear. Whereas some members, you don't hear from them in a year and it's like what are you guys doing? So, no, I like this monthly cadence. I like to stay on top of things. I'm going to get you some information on catalogs versus channels, gonna get you some information on gamification as well. Anything else I'm missing right now? And I'm also going to send you the calendar invite for next month, Thursday, March 20 third, one 30, my time, 10 30 your time?\nWrap-Up\nJEANNIE\n30:35 \nNo, we're excited. Thank you for setting up the introduction call. You know, I did say she like kind of hand picked you for us because.\nMATTHEW\n30:41 \nGood.\nJEANNIE\n30:43 \nSo, we're really looking forward to the relationship.\nMATTHEW\n30:47 \nWonderful. Wonderful. Well, Mariah was great to work with and she's on Matt leave right now, having a baby. So we're all excited for her. And I don't know if I'll just be taking over your account in her absence, if she'll be taking it on when she returns. I'm not sure, but in 2023 I'm gonna be working with you guys and I'm super excited.\nJEANNIE\n31:08 \nThank you. Thank you so much.\nMATTHEW\n31:09 \nYeah, thank you. Take.\nJEANNIE\n31:11 \nCare.

He might not be coming? All right? That's fine. Yeah, maybe it's just go in. Sounds good.\nSmall Talk ends\nMADISON\n0:25 \nAwesome. No worries. I'll give him a couple of minutes, but just to introduce myself, so I know Harrison kinda teed up this call for us, but I, Mattie, I'm an account executive here at Docebo.\nUMAIR\n0:35 \nSo I…\nMADISON\n0:35 \nWould just be now your main point of contact moving forward if we uncover today that, you know, it makes sense to keep that conversation going. So I'd love to just throw it back over to you and Phil up and understand a little bit more about your role, why you're looking for an LMS now? And like how did this initiative kinda fall on your lap? So.\nUMAIR\n0:55 \nOkay. Sure. So just to kinda give you like, you know, a quick summary of like where we are right now with this search.\nAbout Docebo\nUMAIR\n1:02 \nSo we've looked at a couple of different companies. So first of all, we are next in solution. We basically are a reseller for autodesk, which is our parent company. They have a lot of manufacturing softwares for like high position manufacturing and things like that. So we'll be using the system to train people on using that software and how to use, you know, use it at their own location.\nAbout Docebo ends\nUMAIR\n1:22 \nSo it's very like external facing however, so where we are with this search currently with yellow. So we've looked at a couple of different companies, you know, obviously we're in the shopping time right now. So I think we have a kinda dial down to a situation where we're kind of starting to see a pattern. We're starting to see like, you know, the similarities between all the software, what they can offer. So I think we are looking for some very specific… I guess parameters let's just say with the software at this time. So I think I mentioned in the email and things like that integration is going to be the big one for us. We've we already have something in mind that seems to be, you know, where we might be headed, but we still want to check you out because we were, you know, recommended to see what you guys do. So without like that's the initial go, no go situation. If there's no integration with Salesforce, then honestly, that, that's you know, that's gonna be.\nMADISON\n2:21 \nBreaker…\nUMAIR\n2:23 \nSo we don't want to, you know, take too much of your time and go through demos. I think we got a feel for like what your UI looks like, how to create courses. All that seems fine on our side. We understand that. So we want to con, treat this time more like, hey, can we do this? And then if we can, we'll continue the conversation. Is that okay with you?\nIntegrations\nMADISON\n2:40 \nYeah, no, that works with me. So just to drill down a little bit more on the Salesforce integration. Typically, when people say integration, everyone kinda has their own definition. So just to make sure we're on the same page, are you referring to just getting the users like the client customer information from Salesforce to the LMS like an integration like that and potentially pushing like completion rates and back to Salesforce? Or is it one way bidirectional or we have a different integration where you can actually embed Docebo, the LMS into Salesforce. But that's more for like sales training, like someone's in the LMS creating quotes and things like that. They can have the LMS just within Salesforce.\nUMAIR\n3:22 \nThat probably not. Yeah, it will probably be the not the latter. So the, what we start out with just to basically in API integration like the base of it?\nMADISON\n3:33 \nHave you covered there? If it's just like getting user information, data back and forth, there's like two different ways we do that. One is our Automation app that's out of the box with our system. And that just is like a CSV file transfer that pulls a couple of times a day, bringing that data in. And then we do have open API. So if you did want it real just in time, that is an option as well.\nUMAIR\n3:58 \nOkay. Sounds good. I'll let Phil kinda talk to you about that because he is mostly on the Salesforce side of things… I have.\nPHIL\n4:07 \nJust completely, I was mildly distracted but in theory, the… two a street is the best way to put it. But what we need is, so we sell a service package. So like a lot of companies are like, yeah, we push all the contacts from Salesforce over to, you know, our software and it's like, no, we don't really necessarily need that. What we need is a select view based on like a check box that would get pushed into your guys LMS system and granted access with different levels of Permissions, right?\nIntegrations ends\nPHIL\n4:38 \nSo, for example, let's say we have three different products. Well, like there should be three different types of paths they can take. But depending on what we define and Salesforce should determine that path in the LMS, right? The other side would be, is like a parent child relationship.\nPayment Gateway\nPHIL\n4:54 \nSo like purchasing department should be able to be the company with employees under. And then if they decide to just buy a course, obviously push that information back to Salesforce, right? Yeah, that it's so, and so they're enrolled if possible, create an opportunity, add product to the opportunity for the cost of the LMS things of that nature.\nPayment Gateway ends\nMADISON\n5:16 \nOkay. Got it. So what it sounds like is kind of like if so say you have like the three different products, if someone is buying one, you only want them to have access to the content that's relevant for them. They don't need to see the other product learning plans and things like that.\nPayment Gateway\nMADISON\n5:30 \nSo, you know, like tailoring the experience based on who's purchasing what, and who they are in the system. Does that kinda makes sense?\nPHIL\n5:38 \nOne more time?\nMADISON\n5:40 \nSo, like if someone purchases.\nPHIL\n5:42 \nWell, let me ask you this. Do you guys, do you guys have a Shopify integration?\nMADISON\n5:47 \nYeah, we do.\nPHIL\n5:48 \nOkay. So in theory, like they would buy through Shopify and we have Shopify with zap year tied to Salesforce to auto orders. So that would probably be more than suffice. It's more like your guy's user account at the end of the day, like you can have like a company account with multiple users for our customers, not us, right? So all of our training is external to.\nIntegrations\nMADISON\n6:11 \nYeah. Yeah. And I was just saying like taking it a step further like the way Docebo works is not kind of like a one size fits all. So depending on that information and what gets fed over to the LMS, if they're only purchasing a specific product, the content and their experience can be completely different to someone who's purchasing like a like content related to a different software of yours.\nLayout & Content\nMADISON\n6:36 \nSo they're only gonna see the information that's relevant to them and their experience is going to be tailored. And that's where Docebo really shines because it makes it easier for the users. So they don't need to go and find what content do I need? Which one is relevant to me? They don't need to see like everything, it can just be tailored to what is relevant at that moment.\nPayment Gateway\nPHIL\n6:58 \nOkay. I mean, that technically works. Yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Umair explained they are a reseller for Autodesk, needing an LMS to train people on how to use the software at their own locations. \n• Umair mentioned they are in the shopping phase and need integration with Salesforce.\n• Madison asked further questions to clarify their definition of “integration”, and discussed two different ways to get user information back and forth, an Automation app or open API. \n• Phil mentioned wanting to select view based on check box that would get pushed into the LMS system with different levels of Permissions; plus a parent child relationship between companies & employees, with purchase rate pushed back to Salesforce. END"}
{"prompt":"MADISON\n7:06 \nAnd so the use case is purely external. Is there, I know on LinkedIn? It looks like you only have about like 50 employees internally. Would there ever be a need to train the internal Audience as well on the?\nPHIL\n7:19 \nWell, externally, we're talking to a couple of 1,000.\nPayment Gateway ends\nMADISON\n7:22 \nOkay.\nUMAIR\n7:23 \nYeah.\nPHIL\n7:25 \nYeah. Internally, I mean, we do training internally however, because we are a reseller of product, kinda like a car dealer, the person that builds the car has specific training that's held in another MS. So like if we did anything, it would be like sexual harassment classes or something very generic, right?\nPayment Gateway\nMADISON\n7:44 \nYeah.\nPHIL\n7:45 \nBut really what we're after is very external.\nMADISON\n7:49 \nOkay. Yeah. The reason I was just asking is because you can host if you wanted to have that compliance, more mandatory stuff for your internal folks through Docebo as well. And that experience be completely separate than the external, but all hosted under one LMS.\nPayment Gateway ends\nPHIL\n8:04 \nOkay.\nMADISON\n8:06 \nYeah.\nPHIL\n8:07 \nI mean, we don't have an LMS now for any of that shenanigans, nor do we even do that Shana, again. So, I mean, in theory sounds nice but probably not needed. Okay?\nMADISON\n8:17 \nFor sure. And then poking around on your website, it looks like you have a lot of content like you have some videos and different paths already created. Is what kind of file is all that content living in?\nPHIL\n8:31 \nIt currently is all hosted on YouTube. However… what we don't want is the ability to access the YouTube video outside of it. So, ADA will probably just upload video directly to your platform, which leads to the idea. Is they're hosting?\nMADISON\n8:49 \nNo.\nUMAIR\n8:51 \nAll limited as far as the cap? Like, you know, like the data caps and things like that.\nPricing\nMADISON\n8:57 \nYou can have an unlimited amount of content in there, same with users. For on the user side, we only care about who is actually active on a monthly basis. On the content side, we say keep it around one gig, which is about three to four hours of video. And you can have as much of that within the platform as you need.\nUMAIR\n9:15 \nOkay. Because you said the whole user active thing. So they, we look at a couple of other elements systems too, and they have a system where like we could probably bash import, you know, a few 1,000 people into the system. However if they're not active, like actively engaging with the element system, lets you say out of the 2000 people only like 200 people who are using it per month, we still wouldn't get charged for having the 2000 people on there, right? We would only, it'll be based off the 200 monthly active users.\nMADISON\n9:41 \nExactly.\nUMAIR\n9:42 \nExactly.\nMADISON\n9:43 \nAnd, and typically, what we see is not everyone's going in on a monthly basis, of course. So you can recycle those licenses when it is a monthly active user plan and go for a smaller tier than the amount of users that you actually have. Because, yeah, it's anyone who actually clicks play on a video.\nPricing ends\nMADISON\n10:00 \nSo, even if it's just like an admin on the back end logging in to look at reports or something like that, they wouldn't even be considered an active user. It's literally just anyone who's consuming content is an actual learner.\nUMAIR\n10:12 \nRight. Okay. Sounds good. That makes sense. So a couple of other main questions or, you know, these are the critical stuff. So can you, we can host like fast as I'm assuming as part.\nCourse Enrollment\nMADISON\n10:24 \nWith like Zoom team, all the Webinar tools?\nUMAIR\n10:28 \nAnd then we can split those live sessions up to if we need to. So let's just say like, you know, maybe it was a weekly offering thing or biweekly offering thing in conjunction with the actual material that's inside of the course? Okay?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nMADISON\n10:43 \nYeah, I can pull up an example because I know you.\nUMAIR\n10:49 \nWe're…\nMADISON\n10:49 \nEager eager to kind of see the platform in action to.\nUMAIR\n10:53 \nRight, right. Yeah, those are just kind of a main highlight. Things like don't worry, you don't have to get too much like give us the overarching. We understand the overarching stuff. It's just very like a specific thing. So.\nMobile App\nMADISON\n11:04 \nOkay. So, can you all see my screen right now?\nUMAIR\n11:08 \nYep.\nMADISON\n11:09 \nOkay. So I'm just on the Zoom website, and if I go over to the learning center, Zoom is actually one of our customers. What we're seeing now, this is Docebo. So they have completely white labeled it. This is to train anyone who's using Zoom.\nMobile App ends\nMADISON\n11:20 \nWe're all using it now. So pretty much by this point, everyone has a log in. So I can share these links afterwards and you can poke around on your own time. They have all their courses for free. They have some that are just single courses, some that are learning plans. You can kind of see there's like stacked onto each other. There, they've just labeled these different kinds of like channels. And then they have a whole video portion as well.\nUMAIR\n11:45 \nGotcha. Could you possibly just show me one of the courses, what they look like? Just one of them? I just want to see how they're structured on the inside. Okay? So just kinda giving you like an like list of all the different modules content. Okay. Gotcha.\nMADISON\n12:00 \nYou can enroll. Aws. Is another one. You can kinda see the look and feel is pretty similar.\nUMAIR\n12:07 \nRight. So we can completely white label it if we need to.\nPayment Gateway\nMADISON\n12:11 \nExactly. And for different customers, we have different levels of how far you wanna take that customization. So we have something called extended enterprise where we sell them in bundles. So you've got five as like our first bundle for example, and you can give those like VIP clients the like a red carpet experience.\nLayout & Content\nUMAIR\n12:30 \nThe custom.\nMADISON\n12:33 \nTheir own branding colors look and feel if you want, or you can do that through pages where at the top, it would say like next gen solutions up here where it says Aws, and then everything below that bar, you can completely change to any of your clients and that's just out of the box through pages. And all these are set up just through drag and drop widget. So it's really easy on the back end to kind of like put these different pages and experiences together.\nUMAIR\n13:02 \nOkay. Sounds good. And now all of your content. So I'm assuming, are you guys using Aws servers?\nMADISON\n13:08 \nYeah, we are.\nCourse Enrollment\nUMAIR\n13:09 \nAnd you're based in the U. S, the servers are based in the U. S. Just for security and speed reasons?\nMADISON\n13:14 \nHave servers in the us. Yes, we have locations where you can pick. So right now, what we're looking at, this is just a completely non branded like platform experience, but looking at like an Instructor live or virtual Instructor live session. So here, like you mentioned, we have an, we have an integration with maps. If it is in person, people can see where they're going, but you can have different sessions broken up. So here, you must attend one of the two for you to be complete. So these are probably like two of the same sessions. They're just giving people an option what day works better with your calendar?\nUMAIR\n13:53 \nI see. Okay.\nMADISON\n13:55 \nAnd here's where I would say join now your Webinar tool once that integration is happening. But this is just a like a demo experience.\nUMAIR\n14:04 \nYep.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Madison and Umair discussed training needs for an external audience of a couple thousand people.\n• Madison suggested hosting the mandatory compliance classes on Docebo, and points out the amount of content allowed under their pricing plan.\n• Madison showed a demo course on Zoom's white-labeled Docebo platform. \n• They discussed the possibility of customizing branding colors, using AWS servers based in the US for security and speed reasons, as well as integrating Webinar tools with their platform. END"}
{"prompt":"MADISON\n14:05 \nAnd then what's nice here is we have a little content tab. So say, there's like a PDF download or maybe to actually mark the course as complete a survey, they have to finish. That could be like the end marker as well. So there's lots of options there.\nLayout & Content\nUMAIR\n14:23 \nYeah. As far as like the layout and things like that. I mean, like I said, it's similar to other systems just kinda, you know, differently laid out. So we get the core functionality of that. So pretty, is it possible? I don't know if you have expertise in this, but like is it possible just to kind of show us a generic, the Salesforce integration side of things? How it would look if we were to do like a small sample?\nLayout & Content ends\nMADISON\n14:47 \nUnfortunately, I can't do that today on this call. Like I'm not the most techy person. Usually, I have my solutions consultant on the line. Chris. He wasn't able to make it for this call. But in a future call, if you did want to set that up, I can make sure we have someone to highlight.\nUMAIR\n15:02 \nOkay. That would be kind of one of the things that we would like to see and how that's done for sure. So I think really pricing is kind of where we want to kinda see where that's the last, you know, chain the top situation at this point.\nMADISON\n15:18 \nFor sure. I… yeah, I believe in the email you mentioned like you do have budgets approved, and like it seems like your timeline is pretty.\nUMAIR\n15:29 \nShort. Yeah, very short. So we're trying to, we're trying to get something implemented as a P just because, you know, demand is high. So we'd like to get something started. We like we've sampled a few of these things now and we know kind of where we're heading but we just wanna make sure we'll be covering everything. So.\nMADISON\n15:46 \nOkay. Let me pull this up. So what we're looking at now is kinda like a quote builder. We'll just be super transparent with the pricing.\nPricing\nUMAIR\n15:55 \nYeah.\nMADISON\n15:56 \nAnd look at this together. But so you said around like a 1,000 users, but would those users be active on a monthly basis, or do you think it would be more on the smaller side of?\nUMAIR\n16:09 \nSite, right? Phil? Like maybe I would destinat about 200 active monthly users. Is that, what do you think Phil?\nPHIL\n16:17 \nYeah. I mean, we're piloting this out but it's going to grow exponentially based on content creation and speed, right? So, if it proved out on one software, technically two software, this is what we have in the pipeline for it, it's gonna exponentially grow pretty quick.\nMADISON\n16:33 \nOkay. So our entry level tier supports anywhere from zero to 300 monthly active users. And then the next tier up is 500 and it continually bumps up and 500 after that, at any point in the contract, you can upgrade tiers, but you can't downgrade. So I would always say start more on the conservative side. And it is, this is your first MS, definitely probably go with the entry level pack and you'll be seeing, you know, what you're hitting if you do happen to go over, it's five dollars and 90 cents per extra user per month. So sometimes it just makes sense to pay the overage fee versus bumping up tiers. And then once it comes becomes very consistent. Obviously, it would make sense to just go to the next tier. With that. There's a one time onboarding fee. There's two options. But usually when it's 300 users, we recommend just the eight weeks of onboarding.\nOnboarding\nMADISON\n17:27 \nAnd also sounding like you want to get things up and going fast that's probably the one I would recommend for your use case right now, during that time, there's like a configuration testing soft launch to like a handful of clients that you'd want to roll this out to, you know, get some feedback, but of course, we can move as fast as you want.\nPricing\nMADISON\n17:44 \nSo if you need to speed that up, we've seen people do it in six weeks or less or just have exactly what they need to get people in there. And then on the right hand side, what you're looking at here is the pricing for a one year, but our standard is a three year contract and baked into that. We already have discounts of around 15 percent for entering into like a longer term partnership.\nPricing ends\nUMAIR\n18:10 \nGotcha. So a little bit more on the higher side that we were thinking however is our, you open to negotiation customization of that?\nMADISON\n18:20 \nWe can definitely work with you. This is just like the line item pricing. So… you know, if we do kind of uncover that we're the best fit and you feel like we're the best partner and you want to grow with us long term. We can definitely work with the pricing.\nPricing\nUMAIR\n18:35 \nAnd you say it's 596, five dollars, 96 per user.\nMADISON\n18:40 \nFive dollars and 90 cents per.\nUMAIR\n18:46 \nThank you.\nMADISON\n18:46 \nThen I would say that is probably all that you need to get you up and running, but you, the Salesforce integration here, I'm not clicking that because that's the one where the LMS would be actually embedded into Salesforce.\nIntegrations\nMADISON\n19:02 \nAnd it sounds like, you know, content, you already have your content and it doesn't look like you're are you looking to purchase any content? But it sounds like you kinda have that all sorted.\nUMAIR\n19:10 \nNo, that's seat is going to be all in house. So.\nMADISON\n19:13 \nOkay, perfect. We do have a mobile app and that it does come out of the box.\nMobile App\nMADISON\n19:21 \nIt's our go do learn app, what the pricing here for the mobile branded app if you were interested in is just the icon. So having that match your look and feel. But once someone logs in with just our standard app, they would have like the same experience. It's really just for… the logo on the.\nWrap-Up\nUMAIR\n19:41 \nGotcha. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Apart from that, I don't think I had more questions. I think you were able to kinda answer everything that was not critical to us if possible, maybe just kind of forwarding this out to us as a quote to the numbers you have on here would be great. Yep, Phil, did you have any other questions or?\nNext Steps\nPHIL\n20:05 \nNo, I mean, that pretty much explains it for me.\nUMAIR\n20:07 \nYeah. Okay. And then I'll check with you now next week if possible, see if you have any openings with your Salesforce integrate integrator expert. Just see that's kinda like again, I hate to keep hitting it, but that's kinda the main thing for us. So I'm not sure you can take it from there.\nMADISON\n20:24 \nOkay. I will send you some availability for when we can have a Salesforce conversation just to make sure we're on the same page. Would you wanna see like a full hour demo walkthrough or maybe we can do it in like 30 minutes at a more higher level or do you want to just have that Salesforce conversion?\nIntegrations\nUMAIR\n20:41 \nI think we'll start, yeah, with the Salesforce, we'll start there, right? Because like I said, that's a make or break deal that if that works really well according to what we're trying to do, like our workflow, I think we can, you know, go forward from that point.\nMADISON\n20:54 \nOkay. And that integration, you're really just trying to bring that user data?\nIntegrations ends\nUMAIR\n20:58 \n100 percent exactly and some sort of sync curiosity just to kind of a, you know, workflow. You should be, we're seeing right now?\nMADISON\n21:05 \nFor sure. Okay. I can share the pricing with you. I'll share some documents that show just what it all comes core with our LMS and get back to you on some availability for next week. I know you mentioned you're looking at a couple of other ones and it sounds like you kind of have a preferred one. Are you able to share kind of who those other vendors?\nUMAIR\n21:29 \nYeah. I mean, we've been looking at, we've been looking at Talent we've been looking at Absorb. I think that's kind of how we got here by looking at Absorb. We, I think there's a lot of on, you know, you guys have matching capabilities. So I think that's how we ended up here. So just a couple of other ones, you know, market leading ones, but a few, yeah, those would be the stand out right now.\nNext Steps\nMADISON\n21:54 \nOkay. Perfect. That is helpful. And then let me see if I had any other questions. No. Okay. Well, yeah, that's kind of, I think we're all aligned. I can get that over to you and I'll make sure we'll have something scheduled early next week so we can.\nUMAIR\n22:15 \nPerfect.\nWrap-Up\nMADISON\n22:16 \nAll…\nUMAIR\n22:17 \nRight. Thank you so much. Madison appreciate your time.\nMADISON\n22:20 \nThanks, you too.

Gosh. Well, it's definitely the time to have, I mean, I guess it's never the time to have a call but.\nANGIE\n0:52 \nYeah, it is.\nKILEY\n0:54 \nYeah. Okay, cool. So, whenever you said that you couldn't hear me, I thought that my setup was all messed up. So, okay, we're good. Yep, perfect. Well, nice to meet you. Quick. You, where are you actually located right now?\nANGIE\n1:07 \nI, Mac Minnesota.\nKILEY\n1:09 \nMinnesota. Okay.\nANGIE\n1:11 \nWell, for couple of hours from the border Canada?\nKILEY\n1:16 \nOkay, cool. Yeah, I'm in I'm central. So, I'm in saint Louis and Ryan, he's in eastern. So, he's on the east coast in Pittsburgh. So quick, little intro. My name's Kylie. I know Harrison had set this up but I will be your main point of contact moving forward.\nSmall Talk ends\nKILEY\n1:32 \nI'm an account executive here at Docebo. So I'll be kind of walking you through seeing what, you know, you guys have going on today, and if we can help in any way and really focusing on your project and what your initiatives are. And then I brought Ryan, he is my solutions consultant, Ryan, if you want to introduce yourself, yeah.\nRYAN\n1:49 \nHi, Angie. My name's Ryan Whitfield, I'm a solutions consultant here at Docebo. So basically, I just partner with Kiley and making sure that our customers have all of the technical needs answered and would be walking through a demo with you if we got to that point, but yeah, I worked in the neuroscience and mental health field for about 13 years. So when I, anytime I see the psychiatry and psychology stuff come up, I'm always a little extra interested.\nANGIE\n2:18 \nCool.\nRYAN\n2:19 \nNice to meet you.\nANGIE\n2:20 \nNice for you too.\nKILEY\n2:21 \nGreat. Cool. So, Angie, obviously, I have some notes from Harrison that you provided. So we really appreciate you providing all that information. But before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about your role and how this project for an LMS kind of ended in your lap?\nANGIE\n2:38 \nAll little things do I feel like? So my role is just kind of all over the place and that's I guess probably why this fell on my lap but I work really closely with the chief operating officer. So she's between her and the marketing person and our HR department. We've been kind of doing these demos with different people. We started first with the internet, but I would like for you guys to meet them. I guess maybe as a next step if it's possible if it's something we're kind of just on overload right now when it comes to all of these, but I would like you to meet with them as well. So I'm just a small piece of this part, but I'm kind of all over the place. I do a little bit with like behind the scenes when it comes to direct patient care. So just making sure everything's up and running, setting schedules right now. I'm working on building like a new orientation and that's kind of where this came in for me. So we're growing from more of a smaller company to like a more mid medium sized company. And our training and onboarding process is just not it. Right now there, it's just kind of all over the place. So it needs to be streamlined and I've come up with like a placeholder I guess in the meantime, but I would like to go to something more digital that hopefully something like what you guys have. So I don't know that's kind of my I'm a little bit all over the place. But right now my big focus is onboarding for your providers. And then next I'll focus on the staff training… and I won't bore you with the rest of what I do. But as it pertains to this, I will be doing the training section.\nKILEY\n4:11 \nGot it. Yeah, it sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now and everything is kind of all over there's. A lot of moving parts. So hopefully we can kinda help you out with that process. So I do have some notes from Harrison that he had given me. I know that this would be your first LMS, you guys currently don't have one? Is that correct?\nANGIE\n4:30 \nRight.\nKILEY\n4:31 \nOkay. So we were looking at kind of like number of users. So it looks like you guys have about 60 support staff members. Currently, handful of locations, you're in Minnesota, North Dakota. It's all kind of working from home via telehealth. And you guys are growing. So just a quick question, just because we like to get the hard questions out from the get go.\nPricing\nKILEY\n4:53 \nSo we operate actually like on a monthly active user model. So whoever comes into the platform and is taking courses are watching videos. They're considered to be one monthly active user. So just curious on because you guys do have a lower count as of now. I know you guys are growing, but for internal, how many users would you ballpark with that would be coming in on like a monthly basis? Well?\nPricing ends\nANGIE\n5:18 \nI guess that's the thing is we are looking for something to keep it ongoing as well. So it would be that onboarding a handful a month would be coming in. But all staff and providers are going to need some sort of resource hub. We need to retrain a lot of our staff too. So this is something we plan on using and definitely for retraining purposes and kind of like an information hub like how to what there's a lot of misinformation going around in the company too. And it's one of those things where it's like nobody do anything unless you check with me first and that's just impossible as you start to grow because Amanda is only one person.\nIntegrations\nANGIE\n5:54 \nAnd so there needs to be like a place where they can go and fact check how to do something or what the right answer is. So this really is something that's gonna be like a long term solution.\nKILEY\n6:05 \nYeah, that's kind of how it kinda goes whenever you don't have like one centralized hub of kind of like the truth, the source of truth.\nPricing\nKILEY\n6:12 \nI guess, yeah, I noticed. Because just because like your internal, it does seem rather low for monthly, we do start out at like a monthly active user tier of 300 users that's our like entry level. So that's why we were, Ryan and I were kind of poking around on your website and it looks like you do kind of work with partners and different organizations and businesses.\nPricing ends\nKILEY\n6:36 \nSo my question there is, would there ever be a need potentially in the future to train some of those folks for like an external use case?\nANGIE\n6:45 \nYes, we did talk about that as well. Not a huge priority but it would be nice to have some of our outreach locations be able. We don't want them to have access to… like our ehr stuff anymore. It's just getting too big to do that. Come up with a new system for them and then have the information like who just really basic, who, how many appointments they can expect on their days of our patients to come in and who they are, and what we need from them. Just really basic stuff. And then maybe a little bit of our own modified training, yeah, for them. So that would be nice to have external people access as well. Not a deal breaker but.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Angie works closely with the chief operating officer on tasks such as building a new orientation for the company. \n• The project involves creating an LMS, which will be used to onboard providers and staff training. \n• She is also working on building a new orientation as the company grows in size. \n• Angie mentioned training external partners as well as creating an information hub to prevent misinformation. END"}
{"prompt":"KILEY\n7:29 \nYeah. Yeah. The reason I ask is just because when we throw that 300 number out to people, some people that are just getting started in the LMS search, they're like we, that's a lot for us whereas, but it does kinda fall into a collective bucket between external and the internal.\nPricing\nKILEY\n7:47 \nSo if you did have that external Audience as well, that can fall into the monthly active user count. So I always like to say the system is not choosing on who comes in. It's just whoever is coming in on a given month. And then it resets itself every month.\nNotifications\nKILEY\n8:01 \nSo, you know, if you had one person coming in and they left the organization, you can have somebody take their spot the next month.\nANGIE\n8:08 \nYep. Okay. And they don't need to have like an email from our pa, like one of our email addresses, it can be their own external email. Okay? Sounds good.\nPricing\nKILEY\n8:23 \nYeah. So yeah, just curious on, I'm just trying to kinda get like a headcount. I don't know if this would be kind of like an over tell for too many, or do you guys really plan on having more people in the system towards like the end of the year or like what is your vision towards like Growth in the next year?\nPricing ends\nANGIE\n8:40 \nThat keeps changing. We were hoping to just start opening up a few more locations which obviously will make us grow a little bit more and we are keep bringing on new providers. However we are stuck in this place now where we almost don't want to until we get all of this figured out because it's just gotten to be so messy and it makes us look bad like we don't know what we're doing when we aren't organized and have a nice workflow for this type of thing.\nPricing\nANGIE\n9:06 \nSo we're almost kinda putting a pin in it until we can come up with a better system first. So, 300 is a lot, but it doesn't mean, I mean if it's that's okay, it's okay to have, you know, room to grow I guess, but I wouldn't say rapid Growth in the next year. I think we have a lot of work to do internally and then we can kinda start taking off again.\nPricing ends\nRYAN\n9:32 \nOkay, Angie, I just, I wanted to ask a question. So I took some time to look around on your website and I mean, clearly, there's some, there was like a whole section for organizations and partnering with, you know, nursing homes and assisted living group homes, and also hospitals. Like as far as that external goes, like, do you see, do you see any need for, and not even just like compliance training or onboarding? But like just things like maybe, you know, I think the thing we see with mental health is like especially nowadays or things like stress management videos, you know, courses on that from maybe provider within your own organization, like or, and even do you see maybe an interest from your patients coming into this platform directly? Because one of the nice things about Docebo and the way that… we can use it is you can have very separate sections of the LMS that are specifically focused on those groups. So like a patient would never be able to have access to your provider onboarding or, you know, an assisted living administrator is never going to be able to see what patients are doing in the platform. So we, because we really specialize in being able to serve like multiple audiences, customize information from the same platform. So, I think that's the thing like I came from a very small company where I know when we were looking in kind of this same space like an LMS and like just a learning repository for things. I didn't even know that was possible. Like I didn't know that I could have that very different experience for those different groups and I think that would have changed the way we might have approached that search had I known well, we can, we don't this doesn't necessarily have to just house our compliance training and onboarding. This can do everything education and as well as like, you know, document repository. Like we have a whole module for that. And yeah, I just wanted to throw it out there.\nANGIE\n11:40 \nYeah, no. And I mean that's great that it has that feature. I just know that it's not something that we're going to be interested in right away. We just have like big problems we wanna solve first and then we can explore what more can do. But it's I wouldn't say it's an immediate interest at all. And as far as all those other places that you're seeing like on our website like the nursing homes and stuff like that, they would probably for sure be separate from like the ones I was talking about earlier. So we have some of these outreach locations separate from the nursing homes and stuff like that. They would be the ones that I would be interested in having access to some sort of training module or whatever information I guess that we put on there. But a majority of those would be separate that's more like contracted work that we don't even touch.\nSmall Talk\nANGIE\n12:24 \nWe actually have contracted work out in Alaska too. So I mean down the road, once we kinda solve this big problem, then maybe we can start pulling in, it would be nice to bring in some of that Alaska stuff into this and eventually maybe nursing home but not something Amanda is not gonna wanna do right now.\nSmall Talk ends\nANGIE\n12:41 \nSo I think our big thing right now what we're looking for is streamlining HR. We have very messy schedules that it's really hard to kinda keep up with as far as provider training. And when they get credentialed and when they get their license to work in different states and then they're off to Alaska, and then they're back to the states and it gets really confusing.\nSmall Talk\nANGIE\n13:01 \nAnd when they get back to me, they kinda forget a lot of what I taught them a month ago before they travel to Alaska. And you know what I mean? It's just kind of messy in that sense. So that's really the big… ugly thing I wanna fix at first but it is good to know that we have options down the road, but it's not something that we would even think about right now.\nIntegrations\nKILEY\n13:25 \nGotcha. Yeah. Another thing too whenever you're saying you want to streamline HR, do you guys have an HRIS system running today or do you guys like a Paylocity, adp, Paychex? Anything like that?\nANGIE\n13:37 \nAnd I'm sorry, that's something I probably couldn't even answer. I don't know how they handle that.\nIntegrations ends\nANGIE\n13:43 \nI wouldn't even be able to guess, I guess. But from what Amanda told me, my boss is that she just, it's a matter of like knowing where we are in the process, like things get missed or skipped or because we have now two HR people. So even though they work together, some things fall through the cracks. So something to kinda show exactly where they are in the process. So nothing gets missed. You know what I mean? It's yeah, we're still kind of sometimes operating how maybe small businesses would under one roof and one office. And now we're spread so far apart that communication is becoming a problem. You know what I mean? So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kiley and Angie discussed pricing and notifications with LMS search, active user count, external audience, and room to grow.\n• Angie described the current state of their organization, focusing on the need for an organized workflow.\n• Ryan suggested different uses for the LMS to serve multiple audiences with customizable information.\n• Angie mentioned their main focus is streamlining HR related processes due to communication difficulties caused by a dispersed organization.\n• Integrations were discussed with regards to an HRIS system such as Paylocity, ADP, or Paychex. END"}
{"prompt":"KILEY\n14:24 \nYeah, totally get that. Yeah, I was kind of just wondering just because we're not like an HRIS system per SE. We're kind of just like the vessel that delivers trainings to your learners. So for the onboarding, all of those things. So for like an HRIS system that would hold all the information of all your internal employees, things that are HR related would be hosted in there. So that's why we, whenever we do the integrations with that, we kind of pull that information from that. So if you guys don't have that set up today, that's just kind of another note that I wanted to make sure of just because we are not like I said, we're not really like that HR System.\nANGIE\n15:03 \nBut can we like set up? Not necessarily like we're trying to find an HR system, but would this allow us to set up our own kind of glorified checklist, I guess, or process, or is this just a training system? You know what I mean?\nKILEY\n15:19 \nYeah. So there's a lot that you can do with this.\nLayout & Content\nKILEY\n15:22 \nI know in the notes, you said something along the lines of like we don't need a costly platform with all the bells and whistles is a robust platform that can do a lot, but we can also simplify it down for you as well for whatever your needs are.\nLayout & Content ends\nKILEY\n15:36 \nWe do a checklist? We do have different training modules, different content that you would be able to access it. All depends on what you're looking to do.\nANGIE\n15:46 \nOkay. So is there a way for me to actually like go in and play with it and just see what it would be like? I guess.\nLayout & Content\nKILEY\n15:53 \nYeah, we can, we usually go into a demo to show you what it would look like in a live environment, drive you through that at first just so you can get a look and feel of all of the possibilities with Docebo. And then we would turn you onto the trial.\nLayout & Content ends\nKILEY\n16:07 \nThat would be kind of like the next step afterwards. So there is kind of a process to it, but that's definitely possible down the road.\nANGIE\n16:14 \nSo hearing like what our needs are, do you guys feel like that's something you could mark off all those boxes? It seems like everywhere we look between the, you know, the learning platforms and then the internet, it's like I wish I could just pluck things from a, you know, each of them and put them into one. We have not been able to find something that works. I feel like we don't even need that much, but some things are just missing the boat. So like what are your thoughts on our needs versus what you guys have?\nKILEY\n16:44 \nIt sounds like you're trying to like Frank and Stein all of this kind of together but.\nANGIE\n16:50 \nThe only ones that just need these handful of things and we can't find it.\nKILEY\n16:55 \nYeah, it's interesting too just because I think that just starting out trying to find all the moving parts and kind of solidifying everything that's where like the disconnect is, I don't know enough about it, but maybe having more of an understanding of like I don't know Ryan if you wanted to explain this better than me, but having a better basis of where we're going to be pulling information from. If you guys have a system in place right now, I know you mentioned kind of internets. We, I just need to know a little bit more about that. I guess I don't know Ryan if you can expand on that.\nRYAN\n17:28 \nSure. So, so with that, like your internal internet, it would that be something that like having during the onboarding process, maybe they get a few documents that they need to like fill out something like that? Is that kind of how's that sort of thing?\nANGIE\n17:43 \nWe looked into the internet as a place to move away from just using teams for communication since we have so many staff members and providers where we can post updates and, you know, have different pages for different departments where they have just their stuff here and just be organized right now. Some of it's on the server. Some of this in their team group, some of it's on their desktop that's not helpful to anyone else. And you know what I mean? So that's kinda why we went there. And then we thought we could make it work with training and onboarding, but it's like, you know, they missed a few things on here. It's not gonna work. And then just the learning platforms. We're missing the hub part of things. So I don't know. We're kind of just which is why it's down to just me. We're all kind of banging our heads against the wall and I think they quit.\nRYAN\n18:28 \nI, it all set like these are all things that Docebo can do. So, you know, you're talking. So, I think the only thing that you mentioned there was like the hub. So what do you, what do you mean by a hub? I guess?\nANGIE\n18:39 \nSo.\nRYAN\n18:41 \nLike is this where people are, this is the hub where people are coming to communicate with each other. Is what you're…\nANGIE\n18:47 \nThat hub is like kind of what I talked about earlier with fact checking and getting the right information, you know, and things are constantly changing obviously in healthcare and just within the company itself. So posting those kinds of updates different. I mean, you know what I mean? Just company announcements. Our HR software is constantly changing or there's enhancements. We're switching over now to a whole new one actually. So just stuff like that where we can go and see where we're at with everything I guess, and then also to personalize it depending on which department they're at. So we have people giving out wrong information all the time because they heard this three years ago and they switched departments and they still think nothing's changed. And now they're handing out bad information. So that's what I mean about the hub, just all of our information, all of our paperwork… employee paperwork for patients, you know, stuff like that or policies. And yeah, I don't know. I could go on and on, I'm a dreamer. So there's a lot I could put in there, I guess, but.\nCoach & Share\nRYAN\n19:54 \nI think that the, so Docebo does a number of things really well. I would say the onboarding stuff and putting some people through like a plan that's preset they need to go through these things. That's certainly something that Docebo does out of the box, the kind of that social aspect of things, you know, communicating directly about either pieces of learning content or, you know, like I think an example like that hub example that you mentioned and where maybe there's somebody post a video about the new HR system and how to get into it. We have the ability to have message boards, question answers related to those kinds of pieces of learning content that can be guard rail by experts on the topic. So maybe whoever is rolling out that platform is the only one who's able to allow questions into it. So there's those capabilities there.\nCoach & Share ends\nRYAN\n20:47 \nI think the only thing Docebo probably would be not a great place for is like patient documentation you would probably want to have that.\nANGIE\n20:56 \nWe don't we wouldn't use it or like blank forms that they need to fill out. Like we're the most updated forms I can give this patient to fill out, you know, there… no, and that's good. And then like you said with our other issue, I guess with like using teams, having a group with 60 of us in there and then people are just spamming it and it's so something where we can post updates and they don't get to comment, they can like it or whatever. But having that kind of control, I'd be nice.\nRYAN\n21:26 \nYeah, I think, you know, to Kyle's point there's. Docebo can do a lot and it's going to be very and it's the part of the reason why we don't just turn over a trial is because there's just you would get lost in it. There. There are so many different use cases like we work with customers like Aws, netflix and, you know, they're just.\nANGIE\n21:49 \nThat's my worry is that we're too small for you guys.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Angie & Ryan discussed the need for a \"hub\" – where people are able to communicate with one another, post updates, access personal information and personalized departmentsal content. \n• Angie expressed concern that their needs may be too small for Docebo to accommodate.  END"}
{"prompt":"RYAN\n21:52 \nThat we also support tons of small companies too, where we can boil that. I mean, they have lots of features that you're never you're just never gonna need that they support multiple like corporate instances of things. But, you know, to Kyle's point, we have that 300 user model that as long as you can kind of get and that's just the cap. It's not saying that you have to have 300 users a month. But as long as you can get to that point and that's not way over your needs. And I think that there's as far as a functional perspective, this will check a lot of the boxes that you need. And nothing that you said is something where I'm like there's no way they could do that. So aside from like if I and I might have misunderstood it when you were talking about that like patient documentation, if it's just the blank forms absolutely.\nANGIE\n22:43 \nNo, we wouldn't but.\nRYAN\n22:45 \nBut even to that point, we do work with government contractors that have like I TR, contracts. And so, you know, it is a highly secure platform. It's just, it's probably not the best source for something like that. But I don't I think I was misunderstanding what you were saying.\nANGIE\n23:01 \nNo, yeah, that's okay. I'm just gonna check my notes here. If there's anything else.\nANGIE\n23:18 \nDoes it sync our file? So if it's… like does it sync it all or work with Microsoft office?\nRYAN\n23:29 \nLike.\nANGIE\n23:29 \nSomething like that, like if we did put something in our server or updated a form, like would it update automatically? And this was more for the internet. So I'm not sure if this would be the kind of.\nPricing\nRYAN\n23:43 \nLike share… I think we have a possible integration with, I'd have to look into it. But yeah, I can confirm that.\nANGIE\n23:55 \nOkay. And then I would just have to know the price point which I'm sure would depend on or is there just one flat price point? I don't know what our budget is. I know that we got a green light to do what we need to do, but I'm sure it's… within reason, I guess, but I don't have that dollar amount that would be an Amanda thing. But if I can give her an idea at least or I can give you her email if you want something to her.\nKILEY\n24:22 \nYeah. So just kind of like ballparking it. So starting out at the 300 user level account would be around the 20,000 dollar mark and that is not covering the onboarding. So if you guys were going through the onboarding with the 300 user plan, it would be an eight week implementation process to kind of train you guys on the system and get you guys off the ground. And that's around the 5,500 dollar mark. So that's just with the platform and onboarding there. So I don't know, exactly. I know you don't know your budget or anything, but if that's kind of out of the ballpark, then that's fine. I just wanted to make sure that we're really transparent with all the numbers and everything from the.\nANGIE\n25:01 \n20,000 a year.\nKILEY\n25:04 \nSo, yes. So 20,000, 330, I believe.\nANGIE\n25:08 \nFor the year.\nRYAN\n25:10 \nYeah. And then maybe that discover coach and share as well, because that seems like a pretty integral part of things if they want that communication to.\nKILEY\n25:18 \nYeah, that's kinda like the resource hub that we're talking about.\nCoach & Share\nKILEY\n25:20 \nIt's. We call it discover coach and share, which we can kinda cover on the demo if this is a good fit. But I did wanna share my screen really quick too with you just to show you kind of how we use Docebo with our onboarding, and kind of like that resource hub that you were talking about.\nLayout & Content\nKILEY\n25:38 \nSo this is kind of like the landing page. So we call this the vault. You can call it whatever you'd like whatever logo you're gonna put up there. But if you're going through onboarding, so obviously I'm in the sales division. So everybody that's coming in is going to have a different screen for their role.\nLayout & Content ends\nKILEY\n25:52 \nSo we have it laid out like week one week to week three. And you kinda go through these learning paths and kinda as you go, you have some things on the side and resources to call out. And then another thing that you were talking about earlier, you mentioned having something or all your resources on like a centralized hub. So you can call this you kind of whatever you want. We call it in the sales division, sales collateral. So anything we kinda hold this in here so it can all live in here. So you don't have the, I guess this information flying around, you can have kind of this being the source of truth.\nCoach & Share\nKILEY\n26:25 \nWe also call it it's called discover coach and share. But we also have that as well with the question and answer function. And kinda like Ryan was saying earlier, you can get some of what's gonna be happening or who's going to be throwing that information in. So if you find like a credible resource or maybe an article that you find really relevant to everybody, you can add that in and you can even open it up to your community to add things in like that.\nLayout & Content\nKILEY\n26:51 \nSo I just wanted to give you just a little example of how we're using that today and what it can look like if you hated this layout and the way it looks, you can totally change any colors, any brand look and feel these are all drag and drop widgets, usually in our platform. So very easy to use. But this is just one little snapshot of what it can look like.\nIntegrations\nANGIE\n27:11 \nOkay. And this is all web based, right?\nKILEY\n27:14 \nYes… yep. And then quick question for you too. In terms of content, are you guys going to be looking to buy content like prebuilt courses and different pieces of content? We have, the reason why I'm asking is we have a library of around 86,000 courses that you can pick from. It is an additional feature, but it is something that if you are starting out and you don't have that content prebuilt, you can kinda turn to that as well. So just curious if you had anything built out today or if you guys have any people working on building content?\nIntegrations ends\nANGIE\n27:49 \nI would imagine that we would build it ourselves. How would that work? How would you guys possibly have what we would need already? You know what I mean? Or I literally just ask you like other than your, you know, I guess I don't even know. I don't have an example, maybe like HR stuff. I guess, so silly videos you used to watch. But other than that like specific to us, how would that work to have ready for?\nKILEY\n28:17 \nYeah. So it depends on what you're looking for. So like stress management, things like, I mean, I'm just kinda.\nANGIE\n28:22 \nOkay.\nKILEY\n28:23 \nSo, we…\nANGIE\n28:24 \nGot.\nKILEY\n28:25 \nYeah.\nIntegrations\nKILEY\n28:25 \nSo if you were to give us maybe like a list of things, we go back in and see if we can stump the system and see if it's in there. But we do, we consider ourselves kind of like a content aggregator. So we pull 200 vendors that have the best of content out there, and then we can kinda go in and search and kinda come through what you're looking for and then put that into a package. And then that's kind of how we would do that depending kind of on your niche market, right? We can't look up every single thing known to man, but usually it's in there. 86,000. Is there's a lot of info in there?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ryan and Angie discussed supporting tons of small companies and their 300 user model.\n• Kiley gave details about pricing (approx. $25,500 for platform and onboarding) and their discover coach & share feature with a resource hub.\n• It was established that Angie will likely build content herself or use Docebo's 86,000-course library. END"}
{"prompt":"ANGIE\n28:58 \nSo, yeah, my guess is we would build it ourselves even though some of that would probably be neat.\nIntegrations ends\nANGIE\n29:03 \nI'm guessing what we need to train them on is what they didn't learn in medical school, how to use our ehr system? And how do you know what I mean? Stuff like that that's more specific to us, but.\nKILEY\n29:16 \nThat…\nANGIE\n29:17 \nWould be nice, but I think we're gonna have to build it ourselves.\nRYAN\n29:21 \nAnd that one too, we like it, you can bring in content from like PDF. We have a built in slide converter. So allows you to import like a PDF for a powerpoint that you build bringing in as like a learning content. So you can do, you know, then. So later on you can check the box that, you know, this doctor completed these courses and they're good to go and do stuff like that.\nANGIE\n29:45 \nSo, my other thought you may me think for like compliance training and stuff like that. Is there something that we can, sometimes they get missed? I guess I don't know. I heard the providers aren't taking them when they're supposed to. So is there something we can like a reminder specific to a provider? Like then it's their time to take this training. Do you guys have something like that? Yeah. Okay.\nKILEY\n30:09 \nYeah, we do.\nWrap-Up\nKILEY\n30:11 \nWe have push Notifications that would help with that. So, okay, cool. So I know we're at time. Angie, are there any other questions for us?\nANGIE\n30:21 \nThank you guys. I really appreciate your time.\nKILEY\n30:24 \nAbsolutely.\nANGIE\n30:25 \nYeah. And I'll definitely get all this over to Amanda. She's not in today, but… do you wanna maybe I can send you like a follow up email next week? Does that work?\nNext Steps\nKILEY\n30:35 \nYeah, absolutely. You usually, our next step is to plan to go into a demo just to kinda see the platform in action. It usually takes about an hour. So if you did wanna bring Amanda, that would be totally fine. I don't know if you wanted to plan that now or you can send me some times that work for you guys.\nANGIE\n30:52 \nI will wait just because I don't know what the budget is. She might see this and be like we can't right now, we might have to wait five years until we get to that next level. But if she's like, yeah, let's see what they're about. I would probably invite a couple of others too and let you know. So I should know something we meet on Wednesday. So that would be the latest, but we don't work in the same building. We don't even work in the same state. So, but I do get my Wednesdays with her. But if I don't… I would imagine that I would have something for you even by Tuesday.\nWrap-Up\nKILEY\n31:24 \nNo worries. Yeah, that works. And then just for my notes, Amanda is the coo, you said great. Yeah, he's got it. Okay. Well, then I will go ahead and just kinda wait to see what she says.

{"prompt":"BITWARDEN\n0:00 \nCan you hear me now? Hey, I still can't hear you. Come on Zoom.\nDW\n0:17 \nHello? Hello. How about now?\nBITWARDEN\n0:30 \nIt's going.\nDW\n0:31 \nMaybe just the headphone setting?\nBITWARDEN\n0:36 \nOkay. I can hear, can you say something?\nDW\n0:49 \nI can hear.\nBITWARDEN\n0:51 \nI can hear you.\nJEREMIAH\n0:52 \nYeah, okay.\nBITWARDEN\n0:53 \nYes, I can hear.\nJEREMIAH\n0:55 \nIt must have disconnected me. Actually, it's my fault.\nBITWARDEN\n0:59 \nI'm over here like, yeah.\nJEREMIAH\n1:00 \nThe settings are, you know, my goodness. Hi, happy Friday. How are you all?\nDW\n1:06 \nHappy Friday.\nJEREMIAH\n1:08 \nIt's it's finally here and, you know, even though we do this for a living, I'm telling you it is a brand new experience every day.\nSmall Talk ends\nDW\n1:16 \nActually got it. Yeah.\nJEREMIAH\n1:18 \nPleasure to meet you both. My name is Jeremiah and I am an account executive here at Docebo, just a fancy title for really being a consultant and I'm here to safeguard my time and your time. So, figure out kind of, you know, a little bit about the INS and outs of the use case. Are we going to be a good fit? Is it worth you diving deeper? And then anything that you need to know as far as like pricing, look at the platform, answer these specific questions. I plan on being as transparent and open as possible so that we can make sure that this would be the right right fit to continue the conversation. Is that okay?\nDW\n1:51 \nYeah, yeah.\nBITWARDEN\n1:52 \nAbsolutely.\nJEREMIAH\n1:53 \nPerfect. Well, you all have been phenomenal so far about sending some information my way, but before we kinda get started, I've lightly LinkedIn, talk to you that's about all I know so far, but that would be awesome and give you a little bit of idea about how this initiative landed in your lap.\nBITWARDEN\n2:11 \nI can kick us off here. So… I'm the technical training manager here at Bit Warden, as I'm sure you know, from your LinkedIn stocking… I do have a little bit of experience with Docebo. So, I was the primary admin for Docebo… when I took over from a colleague at my last company, ratio, Docebo didn't end up being the right fit at that company. So, we did switch to something else, but I did like the platform when I went through it. So that's part of why I reached out to see if maybe, you know, in our evaluation here at Bit Warden, if Docebo might be a good fit for us.\nJEREMIAH\n2:58 \nSure. That's awesome. Glad you've had some experience. We don't get that every day. So, very near.\nAbout Docebo\nBITWARDEN\n3:06 \nIf you want to introduce yourself.\nDW\n3:09 \nYeah. If you found my LinkedIn profile, just a fake dummy profile so I can comment on social things on there. So not much on there. But I'm a very privacy conscious technical evangelist here, Bit Warden. So I work with a lot of our clients community, some of our localization efforts and we're just looking to improve our platform.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDW\n3:29 \nWe just kind of have a conflict with our help and learning center offering similar content and we're looking to make the learning center stand out with possibly gamified curriculum based layered education that we can use with the primary goal being to educate and help our onboarding process for our different plans such as enterprise teams. And we also have some MSPS who sort of, you know, they host a whole bunch of different clients. We want to help them get off the ground and be specialists with Bit Warden. So that's our goal. It's just making everyone who uses Bit Warden a specialist.\nJEREMIAH\n4:02 \nLove it.\nDW\n4:03 \nI love.\nJEREMIAH\n4:04 \nThis is, this is very unique and awesome. And I know that there are many different audiences that we talked about with the customers being the primary focus. I believe with this. Okay. So I am curious to as well. So very first MS, for Bit Warden, nothing's been in place the learning center that I found from like the help center and things like that. Is that the correct place that you're offering the?\nDW\n4:26 \nYeah, just, yeah. Bit word, dot com learning.\nJEREMIAH\n4:30 \nPerfect. Perfect.\nBITWARDEN\n4:31 \nSo right now, we have video content kinda like one pager explainer type content but primarily video, we would love to be able to start offering some interactive, you know, E learning type content. But right now, since we're just using our CMS that doesn't support that. And we'd also very much like to be able to guide users a little bit easier so that, you know, depending on what product, I think I had mentioned this via email. But if I didn't apologize right now, we're focusing on the password manager product. So depending on the product and the plan that they are using, we'd like to be able to better direct them to what they might want to learn about.\nPayment Gateway\nBITWARDEN\n5:23 \nBecause obviously, depending on, you know, whether you're a free user or a, an enterprise customer, you have access to different features. And so we, I don't we don't necessarily mind if they know about those other features that they don't have access to. But it doesn't make sense to put them through a path or a feature that they don't have. So, you know, trying to account for that and just make the onboarding process as easy as possible for customer.\nCourse Enrollment\nJEREMIAH\n5:54 \nSure. So, and I saw that they are like I said, different plans, different options specifically when a business like comes on board. Are you hosting this mostly through the E learning side of things where you have videos, you have the documents and powerpoints. Are you also doing kind of one on one Instructor led like leading sessions and collaborating sessions within?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nBITWARDEN\n6:15 \nYes. So we do both. I think also part of the goal here is obviously, it's hard to scale with just, you know, two people running trainings trying to make as much content available, self serve as possible. Not necessarily. I don't think we'll ever get away from doing live trainings, but to make it so that the live training is kind of a nice option as opposed to a must for some of those questions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Currently, there are video contents available in Bit Warden’s learning center, they want to incorporate interactive e-learning content and direct users better according to their product plan. \n• They also offer both E-learning side - videos, documents, powerpoints - and instructor led training sessions. END"}
{"prompt":"JEREMIAH\n6:48 \nYeah, yeah. Okay. Well, this is unique. Is there any customer that stands out as far as like someone that you would cater to more than anyone else or give like a branded experience to?\nDW\n7:01 \nI think our, yeah, our bread and butter is going to be like our enterprise users and our enterprise administrators.\nPayment Gateway ends\nDW\n7:07 \nBut yeah, if like zooming out, I think we would love to be able to, for people to kinda pick their product and then pick their role if that is something that would be possible just to say, hey, I want, you know, Bit Warden or I want these password less Dev. So just, I don't know if you have categories or flags that you can kind of do that with your material, but that would be cool if we could do that.\nJEREMIAH\n7:29 \nDefinitely. Yeah. And we call them like unique identifiers when they register to the platform or if we're capturing this in another way.\nIntegrations\nJEREMIAH\n7:36 \nSo you mentioned you may have a system like when a customer comes on board, whether it's a CRM, I know internally, maybe an HR system. So the internal side could be easy as far as, you know, getting them into the platform. But I'm curious how you're managing all the customer data that you have, and if we could potentially integrate with that so that when someone signs with you for Bit Warden, they buy and purchase this plan and they are within this role or if we want to point them to start capturing those pieces, we could do it automatically.\nDW\n8:02 \nInteresting. Yeah. Right now, we used to use fresh and we're moving over to Hubspot. So I don't know if you have any kind of integrations with Hubspot?\nJEREMIAH\n8:10 \nBeautiful. Okay. We can talk about that more. I'll promise you now, I am not a technical expert at all. I've been in this role for many years. So I do understand, you know, most of the product, but I'll have a solutions consultant that comes on that will kind of validate those technical pieces. We'll talk about single sign on making things just simple for certain audiences. So if we ever get into a whole that I can't answer, I'll just let you know that I can't but Hubspot would be fantastic. My thought would be is that if you have that customer information in there, it can pass directly to Docebo. And we can even pass certain things back to Hubspot. So if you do want to track progress or have certain things that you want to monitor that is BI directional, so.\nCourse Enrollment\nDW\n8:52 \nInteresting.\nBITWARDEN\n8:54 \nQuestion. And this is not something I don't know if it's a feature because we didn't use it at my last company… does have the ability to, for example, we have a weekly live demo that anybody can sign up for. Is there the ability to have integrations with Zoom and, or Google meat?\nNotifications\nJEREMIAH\n9:21 \nYes, ma'am for both. So essentially, we would take the license that you have, and we'd insert that license into Docebo. And then we're creating the link through Docebo. You can then notify them via like Notifications, emails. We have the mobile app that's available to as well. So depending on how you want them to be aware that you're having that weekly Webinar, there's a lot of ways you can actually post it to, it could be posted through like a course and they can log in and then you could track certain aspects of it.\nNotifications ends\nJEREMIAH\n9:49 \nWe can actually put it on the homepage. We recently did our sales kick off internally through a virtual Webinar. We did it directly on the homepage of our enablement platform which is used as Docebo. So yeah, so many ways that you definitely can leverage that. And just depending on how you wanted it to work and maybe some of the data that you wanted to take out of it, maybe you want some information to come back to you once you do the Webinar, maybe like a survey and required survey to get some feedback back. So lots of possibilities.\nDW\n10:14 \nAll right. No.\nJEREMIAH\n10:18 \nHey, so this is awesome. I know that you mentioned too as well for usage and I always go to usage too is typically like the number one yellow or red flag and people's conversations. So my preference is just to bring it up early… for Docebo.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n10:32 \nWe're unique. And if you talk to multiple different vendors, you'll notice that we all price a little bit different. And I apologize now for the confusion that can be… Docebo focuses on an active user, but we also define an active user a little bit different too. So we can have an unlimited number of registered people.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n10:49 \nI mean, they have a user name and password and you can have an unlimited number of people log into your platform where they become active is as soon as they touch a piece of content, so they click into a course and start learning or they take a test or they answer a question within a survey, something that we can track that says, hey, they've clicked here.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n11:04 \nThey've spent this amount of time in this specific document or this video. So once they do that, they're active just for 30 days. And that's just during your billing period, they'll consume one of the licenses that you have from a tier of licenses. And then at the end of that billing period, all the licenses go right back to you.\nPayment Gateway\nJEREMIAH\n11:21 \nAnd if that user comes back and takes training, great, they'll take another license. If they don't someone else will use that license that they use last month. And so you can mix and match new customers coming in, old customers coming out a mix of both. Maybe you have multiple audiences coming in and you're all pulling from the same tier of licenses.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n11:36 \nThe starting point for us is 300. You could have 50 people. You could have 10. You could have 299, 300 is our beginning. And then we go in jumps of 500. So we go from 300 to 500 and then from 500 to a 1,000 to 1,500 to 2000 and continue to. I think one of our largest customers in Amazon Thompson routers, they have a couple of 100,000 in the platform.\nDW\n11:57 \nAnd is it easy enough to scale. So say that we want to start with 300 as like a pilot roll out. And then we wanna, you know, we're like man, this is really catching on. We gotta jump to like 10,000. Is that easy to do a sort of on the flyer? Does you have to wait till the end of the month?\nJEREMIAH\n12:12 \nYeah, on the fly for sure. So you'll have an account manager and a customer success manager, and you'll also be shown the number of active users, right on your log in when you log in. So you're gonna know exactly what's happening. We'll start emailing you at 80 percent, 90 percent talking about. Hey, is this going to be consistent usage? Is it a one off kind of thing? Because it may not always make sense to jump tiers. So the thought is then once you do jump tiers, we're simply making an addendum to your current contract. So it doesn't renew, it doesn't extend it. You just pay the difference between what you already paid and what you have left to pay for the end of the year for that term. And then if we decide to stay in that tier the next year, you have your annual payment, our payment turns are annual net 30. So we'll send you a Bill. You have 30 days to pay for that annual term. And then your standard contracts about 36 months.\nDW\n12:56 \nOkay. And is it like a sliding scale where the more licenses you have, you get kind of a discount or is it just flat all the way through?\nJEREMIAH\n13:03 \nExactly like that? So you'll see a big break at a 1,000, you'll see another big break at like 2,500, but each time you scale up, you'll see a difference in that pricing.\nDW\n13:14 \nOkay. Got it. Okay.\nJEREMIAH\n13:17 \nWell, also say like upfront we work on obviously getting this up to start.\nOnboarding\nJEREMIAH\n13:23 \nMaybe like I would say like a soft launch to the customers or a certain group of users to get them familiar, and then bringing in utter, sorry, it's Friday, right? Bringing in any other Audience too as well. Our thought is understanding like what is your, what is your full use case? How can we help you project plan from the beginning? And maybe there are certain things that we're not gonna leverage, but we can start setting up together so that when those audiences come in or when those are coming in at scale, it's easier for us just to navigate and turn on. But once you go through implementation with Docebo, it's about an, I would say an eight week time line from the time you sign to the time that we'd be ready to actually have users come in and do some soft launch testing or user testing and roll out… I was going somewhere really good and we'll be honest and I lost it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • BitWarden focuses primarily on enterprise users and administrators.\n• Jeremiah and DW discussed the integration of BitWarden with HubSpot and other tools, notifications, course enrollment, usage tracking, pricing (which is based on active user 30-day duration), payment gateway, scaling plans and onboarding process timeline (8 weeks). END"}
{"prompt":"DW\n14:10 \nThat were all good. It was good.\nJEREMIAH\n14:13 \nYeah.\nDW\n14:15 \nLike, I think it'd be cool after this call, if we could get maybe like two streams of quotes one just for like, you know, what it would cost to roll out a pilot at 300. And then, you know, maybe what it would cost to have like 10,000, you know, paid users. I think, you know, some of our communities have like 50,000. So we're hoping to get into the, you know, 10, 20 30,000, but it'd B, I think it'd give us a good idea to have 300 and then budget for 10,000 just so we can kinda look at the long term with that, how that's gonna look.\nJEREMIAH\n14:44 \nAnd these would be 10,000 that are like actively within your content, like doing some type of learning within that month. We would say there would be 10,000 unique individuals that would click into content, take a course look at something. I just wanna make sure that we're…\nPricing ends\nDW\n14:57 \nYeah. And if…\nBITWARDEN\n14:58 \nIf…\nDW\n14:59 \nIt, if it's not a pain, we could do like five and 10. Like I don't know how much of a strain it is on your end for. Sorry. So what were you gonna say?\nBITWARDEN\n15:07 \nNo, I was just gonna say, I'm not sure. And maybe obviously, you're more much more familiar with the community and whatnot… because of the unique way, I think we'd certainly expect to have 10,000 users registered.\nPricing\nBITWARDEN\n15:24 \nDon't know that we'd have 10,000 users active on a monthly basis. Please, correct me if I'm wrong there. I'm I've only been looking at the learning center data so far.\nDW\n15:38 \nSo it's tricky because we have millions of customers, but we have tens of thousands of businesses, but I don't have the numbers for how many employees those tens of thousands of businesses have. So it really is hard to say at this point, but I think, you know, 10,000 is like a stretch goal, but I think it's good to just have an idea of what that is. But yeah, like what number do you imagine sort of starting at size side? 300 is fine. But I think we'd have to scale up if it is successful.\nBITWARDEN\n16:04 \nYeah. I mean, I would say just kind of thinking about our use case. I would say maybe the 5,000 mark… would be more reasonable. I think it just depends on how actively we end up marketing this because if our sales teams are pushing this out and letting their customers know that, hey, this is a great resource that's available for them.\nPricing ends\nBITWARDEN\n16:31 \nI could see that number jump very quickly. Something that I don't know if you noticed Jeremiah is that right now our learning center is kinda hidden, you know, it's the learning center within the help center. And so we really, with this project, we do want to try to bring a lot more visibility to it.\nPricing\nBITWARDEN\n16:51 \nSo I can see that increase but I don't know how much of it would be like an initial spike versus a consistent monthly users.\nJEREMIAH\n17:01 \nFair.\nBITWARDEN\n17:01 \nMake sense?\nJEREMIAH\n17:02 \nYeah. And of course, like there's a lot that plays into this too, what's the strategy once their customer and they go through their onboarding. Do they come back? Is there a reason for them to come back? Are there things that change the product? Are there things that drive them into that learning center? And then, yeah, I would say that it's a solid number like the thought process behind like what you have, I can share with you that when we have a large number of users come in, we also do statistics on like, hey, who's truly an active user in the platform? And what are the numbers? And we see around 40 percent. So if we have a very large number of users, whether they're customers, internal mix of both, a lot of about 60 percent of our customers are hybrid use case. So it's hard to pinpoint exactly who the primary focus can be. But we definitely, we'll say that scaling is not an issue, giving you something that you don't reach is an issue signing you up for 5,000 when you're sitting at a 1,000 is going to be a really bad.\nDW\n17:58 \nYeah.\nJEREMIAH\n17:59 \nWe would much rather put you in like let's crawl before we walk before we run.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n18:03 \nAnd then if we start to see that overflowing of people coming in and leveraging the platform, we love the fact that people are going to be excited about it. But we do want to get to the point of what's consistent for us and in business terms. And you're bringing on new customers, you sign somebody big on, you might have a very big spike in users in a month taking their training for the first time.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n18:21 \nSo we'll think about all of that. I, I'll give you a ballpark on the phone. Now for what it is. 10,000 is pretty drastic difference from the 300 price range for sure. But we give you kind of a breakdown and for 300 or starting points, right? Around 20,000, 330 dollars. And that's broken into about five dollars and 65 cents per user per month. Okay? So let's see 5,000, it would be around 84,000 annually. And your difference in per user per month is you're only paying a dollar 40 at the 5,000 mark, 35 to a dollar 40.\nDW\n19:00 \nCan we do it? Sorry to interrupt you? Can we do a 1,000 as well? Because maybe that's more in line with what I was thinking there too?\nJEREMIAH\n19:06 \nYeah. A 1,000. This is right around 35,300 dollars and that's 294 per user per month?\nDW\n19:14 \nAll right. Yeah, that's probably something that's helpful.\nBITWARDEN\n19:17 \nYou repeat that 30.\nJEREMIAH\n19:19 \n35 310.\nBITWARDEN\n19:21 \nOkay, great. Sorry, I started writing down 1,000 as the money mark. And then I was like crap. What did you just say?\nJEREMIAH\n19:30 \nYeah, I'd sell a lot more of this for sure. A 1,000 dollars. I can imagine that now.\nDW\n19:36 \nThat was, that was how much per user?\nJEREMIAH\n19:39 \nThat's 294 at the one.\nDW\n19:41 \nOkay. Because I think that's helpful for, to get our budget approved, you know, swinging in a 1,000. And then if we scale up before that's successful, then it's easier to sell the team on it. So, yeah, this is really helpful budgeting.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n19:52 \nDefinitely, and truthfully too, I mean, I know that we're like even recording this, our goal is to build a great foundation like does that make sense for us to be your partner? What can we bring to the table? How can we strategize with you to, you know, meet the KPI'S to prove that return on investment? And maybe there's a voice at the L and D table that we're speaking about, right? Like proving that this can scale and grow and every team and every department can leverage it. So, you know, yeah, truthfully our thought is like wherever we can get in the door that's great once they see the value and we prove the value.\nCoach & Share\nJEREMIAH\n20:18 \nIt's going to be even easier for all of us, you know, to continue to scale with that. But the numbers I'm giving you right now are what we have less like a list price. We also have one module that we'll talk about in the demo for sure. It's going to be called discovery coach and share, but that's the social and collaborative piece so that if we wanted to open it up like answers and questions, maybe direct certain things to subject matter experts or allow me to contribute to a channel, maybe I can upload a video or recording or a document and just share that with a group of peers.\nPayment Gateway\nJEREMIAH\n20:46 \nWe'll see if you find value in that or not. That can be the only thing I can think of right now that would be additional to the price that I listed.\nDW\n20:53 \nOkay. And does this solution have like gated and non gated? Or is it all like how does that breakdown?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • DW and Jeremiah discussed pricing options for scaling their community of users from 300 to 10,000.\n• They settled on a budget of $35,310 with $2.94 per user per month for 1,000 members, and $84,000 with $1.40 per user per month for 5,000 members.\n• They also discussed an additional module called Discovery Coach & Share for social and collaborative features such as question-and-answer boards and content sharing between peers. END"}
{"prompt":"DW\n20:58 \nLike if we wanted to have like entry level is accessible to anyone, and then you log in to get access to everything else.\nJEREMIAH\n21:07 \nCan you elaborate on that one more time?\nDW\n21:09 \nWith your solution, does user have to create a log in to access everything? Or is there anything that they can sort of view and work through before they create an account?\nPayment Gateway\nJEREMIAH\n21:19 \nWe would, you could set it up. Both, we actually have like an external facing catalog to where you could provide like learning or training to anyone that's not a registered user again, you're still leveraging a license for them if they access the training that you're offering them on the public side, but then once they register, you could have a completely different experience.\nPayment Gateway ends\nDW\n21:41 \nAnd is there any option to integrate payments into any of these education tools?\nJEREMIAH\n21:46 \nAbsolutely. But if you don't mind, I'm such a visual person, let me share my screen just real quick to make sure that we're on the same page. And I promise you like from one LMS to the next, our terminology is so different.\nPayment Gateway\nDW\n21:58 \nGod.\nJEREMIAH\n21:58 \nAnd it can be crazy. So what I'm thinking of what I'm envisioning this is one of our customers that does external facing… they sell training externally. This is in euros as well. So where we are global, but essentially what they're doing is they're offering catalogs. So they have a topic here and they have all the content based on the topic below it. If I click into this, I could purchase it or add it to a cart. Now, you do have to have like a payment gateway on the back end… to manage that at all. But yes, it could happen. So this is before they register. So they sign in would be here.\nPayment Gateway ends\nJEREMIAH\n22:32 \nThe register would be here. We could capture user name and password, or as you mentioned, if you had specific unique identifiers, like what is your role? What's your location? We would just add the certain things here. And I think we have additional fields that you could also create to.\nPayment Gateway\nBITWARDEN\n22:47 \nAnd just a question on that because again thinking about pricing. So let's say if a user is, you know, browsing or going through some non gated content, they haven't registered or logged in yet. And then they do go and register or log in. Is that, does that kind of user count carry across?\nPayment Gateway ends\nBITWARDEN\n23:14 \nYou understand what I'm saying? Like, you know, I take a look. I like the first video. Okay, let me go register and take three more. Is that, you know, is that still considered the same seat?\nJEREMIAH\n23:26 \nThat's a good on the same browser? Yes. Now, if they were to browse that log off and then go to a different computer that's another story. I would believe that's a good question. I don't have the answer to just now. I will definitely write that down and find out for you that's great. And it also just depends too. So what I'm doing here, browsing, this is an actual course or some learning day. They're not allowing me to really go in and access the course yet until I've registered. So if you did have something on this homepage that was public facing, then yes, anyone that access it would have a license at tied to that user, the IP address.\nDW\n24:05 \nOkay. Can you just tap on the filter there for a?\nJEREMIAH\n24:10 \nYeah, absolutely.\nDW\n24:11 \nSee what that looks like. Okay, cool.\nLayout & Content\nJEREMIAH\n24:15 \nAnd then give me one second to I have a couple of different screens. So I'm going to share this and I find it's easier to just to generate some conversation. So this would be, this is someone I'm working with currently to bring them on board. But if I sign in depending on how I've registered and what you've captured, as far as those unique identifiers are additional fields, I'm then brought to a specific landing and this landing page would speak to the certain role for this user.\nLearning Plans\nJEREMIAH\n24:43 \nThis was an onboarding role. So they only have content in front of them. This content was all in the not started paying. And then as we've jumped in, we can always take off where we left off. And then the goal is, so everything over to completed. Now, with this in mind, once they're done with this role, we automatically have them kind of graduate into a new page.\nLayout & Content\nJEREMIAH\n25:03 \nAnd now they have access to this page where they can go and access some courses. Maybe they have certain certifications, maybe they just have an explorer self discovery library that they could click into as well. But these landing pages, they're all just widget based. So depending on what your Audience is or how you wanted to promote learning and training, you could put anything on the page and just guide them through it as you like, you can link them outside of them as well. Or you could I frame something from your website into the platform too?\nBranches & Groups\nDW\n25:29 \nAnd is attaching the role something that we do? Or is that like say there's like a manager and employee both as part of the system, they can do that for each other or is this something we do on our end?\nJEREMIAH\n25:39 \nSo on your end, essentially, we wanted to set up kind of the automated side to set it and forget it. The thought is, and I can actually show you two whether we're with Hubspot for the learners or like the HR system for the inside folks. We have like a branching and grouping system and bear with me I'm usually not a demo where I got so many things popping up here. I click into user management. What we've done is we've broken these down into two different paths, right? So internal and external, the external is broken down even further into contractors, customers, distributors, partners. But essential tally why we're doing this is we're mimicking the learning hierarchy on their side that's coming from Hubspot are coming from Salesforce, something that they have.\nPayment Gateway\nJEREMIAH\n26:22 \nAnd then we're also tracking all of the different unique identifiers here so that we can choose what they see as far as content or if they signed up, this certain customer, one signed up with this product, they all were enrolled in to a just a, the certain courses that are available to them. Maybe they have access to some self discoverable courses. But I'm controlling all of that now and customer one doesn't know customer two or customer three is in the platform, however they all see the same types of training and they can all interact with that training too.\nBITWARDEN\n26:49 \nNow… something I do wanna call out. And again, this might be something for more of your solution architects and whatnot, but we will probably have a combination of both sides. So even just talking about our customer base, we have some customers who come through sales and some customers who self serve, they purchase the product online without ever interacting with how.\nPayment Gateway ends\nBITWARDEN\n27:19 \nAnd we also, you know, obviously if we have a point of contact that did talk to sales that would be coming through Hubspot. But they may want to send their end users to our training that otherwise, you know, they would have a license in our product, but they, you know, may have never had a sales interaction. You know, Bob in finance is not necessarily going to be, you know, the same person that will be using the product on the day to day. Is there are there ways to… associate that? Or would that be kind of reliant on the end user filling that information in or?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeremiah and DW discussed setting up a payment gateway to allow users to access content after they register.\n• DW raised concerns over customers who self-serve without interacting with sales, but still being able to access training content. Jeremiah noted that depends on the end user filling in information accordingly. END"}

I have a friend that has the he's like we're going down there, and my parents have a play. I was like, yeah, for sure. It snowed half a foot here last night, so I'm ready to get out of this place. So.\nFREDERICK\n1:13 \nLike a little break is welcome. That's great.\nNICK\n1:15 \nYeah. Yeah. And funny enough. I was actually looking at this happens every time around this year. I was looking at like long term rentals in Florida for next January, so I can just go work remotely down there for a bit. So.\nSmall Talk ends\nFREDERICK\n1:30 \nThat's probably a good idea.\nNICK\n1:33 \nBut anyway, but no, hey, I'm super excited to be chatting with you today. I know Harrison had set up our call, reached out initially interested in learning more about Docebo and happy to answer any questions today and also learn a little bit more about S-NET and sort of what you're looking to accomplish and really just determine if we're a good fit for what you're looking to do. So we'd love to learn a little bit more about that. So, I mean, it's always, I always like to kinda get a quick intro on your end just to kick things off and then learn a little bit more about your project.\nFREDERICK\n2:07 \nYeah. So, yeah, I've been with S-NET, I think now for just really a few months.\nAbout Docebo\nFREDERICK\n2:13 \nI think the end of November. So I came on as a vice president of marketing. I came over to really boost our initiatives of what we were doing, which a lot of things we weren't doing previously. So, for instance, one of my main objectives is really to focus on our inbound and outbound marketing efforts, really get our brand stuff.\nSmall Talk\nFREDERICK\n2:40 \nFor instance, we have a new big website project that will be completed in April which I'm sure you probably took a look at our website and yeah, it's it looks like it was done 15 years ago. So, you know, we apparently we fell prey to neptism a little bit earlier in the beginning of the company and I kinda stayed that way for a while. So I'm coming in, cleaning up a lot of things.\nSmall Talk ends\nNICK\n3:10 \nThe boss project, yeah.\nFREDERICK\n3:12 \nExactly. Yes. So I'm doing a lot of that. I got a whole new team and marketing. So my cro said the same thing when he came on before me, which I worked with him previously. So I guess all anyway.\nNICK\n3:28 \nI know.\nFREDERICK\n3:29 \nIt's hypocritver here, but he did the same thing where he had to like clean out his team and pretty much start again. So, yeah, anyway, but yeah. So I'm looking to help modernize the company. One of the one of the things that I have here is I inherited was this application, the service that we're using called what is it all bound? So it's basically like a, you know, it's our partner portal. It's where we put our stuff. I'm sure you've probably heard of it before, right? Zip solutions.\nPayment Gateway\nNICK\n4:02 \nOkay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nFREDERICK\n4:03 \nIt's kinda like that. So we're using all bound for our partner portal. So basically it's where we put all of our content for partners. You know, all our spits training, etcetera, you know, our LMS courses that's where we do a lot of that stuff.\nPayment Gateway ends\nFREDERICK\n4:21 \nAnd I could certainly do, you know, do some of that to some extent for our sales team as well. But I'm looking for other alternatives. So I'm looking for an alternative for… specifically, you know, the first real need I'm looking for is sales training because we really need a tool… that has a lot of that could be very effective with our sales team and get our sales team training trained up properly.\nAbout Docebo\nFREDERICK\n4:52 \nAnd we also need that tool to probably talk to Hubspot. So we could know what they're doing and what they have accomplished. Additionally, you know, the second phase of a project that is also looking at end user customer education so that, you know, that could mean our, you know, our partners, their customers, and when we sell direct our customers as well. So then that could be on a number of things… as wide of a game as onboarding, knowing certain systems, whether it's like their phone systems, or whether it's new products, learning how to use our contact center solution, how to use our engage collaborate team collaboration solution. Et.\nNICK\n5:52 \nAwesome.\nAbout Docebo ends\nNICK\n5:53 \nNo, I'm just taking some notes here too that's exactly, you know, that's exactly what our solution is designed to handle is what you've described like that multi Audience, right? Yeah, sorry, it sounds like that initial need and this is what you shared with Harrison and for sure, I can support you there from a sales training perspective, sales enablement, right?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Frederick is the Vice President of Marketing for S-NET, working on new initiatives and modernizing the company. \n• They are using a partner portal called Allbound, but Frederick is exploring alternative options.\n• He is looking for a tool to support sales team training as well as customer education on things such as onboarding, systems, products and team collaboration.

{"prompt":"NICK\n6:13 \nWe have a lot of customers today. They're using it for that, but most of our customers are also using it for an external facing purpose as well, right? Whether that's partners customers and being able to really gate those experiences that content and automate a lot of it. So platform knows, you know, when Frederick comes in, he's internal, right?\nPayment Gateway ends\nNICK\n6:33 \nWhen your customer comes in, they see something completely different and being able to manage all that from the single back end. So we can repurpose content and things like that. So good news is, yeah, we're speaking the same language and we certainly that's where we do well if you will in the marketplace to dig into some of these things. And obviously meeting you where you are today, it sounds like that initial sort of initiatives around the sales training. Can you sort of how that's being conducted today? Like what's the current process for sales training within the organization?\nFREDERICK\n7:08 \nCurrently, we're leveraging asian tool called confluence and all of it's being kind of info dumped into there. And it's not really, it's organized. Okay? But, you know, there's no LMS aspect to it which we want to have. Additionally, it's not talking to Hubspot. So we don't know… what training our sales teams have been doing and what they haven't been doing. So, you know, we really need accountability with that… Hubspot integration and that visibility, you know, especially, you know, we can build out with those reports obviously in Hubspot, but we need some kind of integration to talk to Hubspot.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n7:58 \nI'm curious to know. So in Hubspot, is that, where is it? Just, so I'm clear on it somewhat of a record of what your sales folks have completed, maybe some gaps they have? Like, is it really just a place that you go to sorta have a sense of what's going on the sales team? Is that what you're thinking of this tool as well?\nFREDERICK\n8:20 \nIt's one of the aspects. Yeah. Yeah. So basically, you know, my cro goes into Hubspot to see all of the reports on everything.\nIntegrations ends\nFREDERICK\n8:33 \nSo, you know, when they go into, to see what a salesperson is doing, you know, they could see their 30 60 90 days of, you know, how many calls they made, how many emails they did, how many, you know, how all those granular interactions and be able to measure that on what they're producing and what their value to the company is.\nIntegrations\nFREDERICK\n8:56 \nAnd frankly do we keep them around. So we would like to also have that a tool that would also connect with that integration. And I don't know if you have a default integration or API or whatever, but we can get into the granularity of that in a minute, but.\nIntegrations ends\nNICK\n9:16 \nTotally.\nFREDERICK\n9:17 \nWe'll we'll need to be able to, you know, pull very high level just, you know, we're gonna be able, we wanna be able to provide them like yours, your week by week for your 30 60 90 days of training and expectations that we foresee, you know, what we want you to deliver. So basically, you know, we want to have at least, you know, even if they're not, you know, a video with a course at each one of them, at least it's like some kind of like, you know, basically like a form. I guess, you know, that we would create with an LMS questions like did you do XY and Z here's?\nIntegrations\nFREDERICK\n9:56 \nSome information and the link. So that's what I'm foreseeing you know, for the sales team at the beginning. And I'm sure you can imagine the, what the customer one would look like.\nNICK\n10:07 \nYeah, for sure. So we need to get some data back into Hubspot, be able to report on it, see what activities happening and draw some correlations, likely, right? Typically see in the sales enablement world is okay. If rep a is doing xyz training, how is that impacting their actual performance, right? And you can start drawing some of those correlations. So, you mentioned SAP, I mean, we, we're open API. We have a tool called connect, which is like a MIddleware leg API, but it's powered by Workato. So, but it uses the same idea of being able to pull and create recipes and grab data out of the LMS and whatever tech stack you're looking to bring that data into. So I'm not your technical resource. I will pull resources in as we see fit but I can give you the thumbs up, like for sure, we can handle something like that.\nIntegrations ends\nNICK\n10:59 \nSo, but if there is specifics you want me to know about while we're on the topic of integration for sure, but there's tons of other stuff I'd love to ask about too, yeah, please. But yeah, I mean, understanding. So we kinda have a sense of who your learners are.\nPricing\nNICK\n11:13 \nWe got the internal sales folks and I know Harrison kinda mentioned the scope of your project, right? Like our entry level pricing will get you up to 300 active users per month. From a sales perspective. I think you're I mean, you're probably not going to hit that, right? Based on what he shared with me, but it didn't seem to deter you kind of giving you that entry level pricing. Do you have a sense? Yeah. Do you have, so just so I understand the scope of things roughly, how many sales or how many internal folks would be in your platform kind of each month. And then I would love to know around the external customer facing side as well.\nFREDERICK\n11:54 \nYeah. I would believe that at the beginning, we'd probably test this out with like, you know, a small part of our sales base, maybe like 10 to 15 people. And then for our customers, we probably test with like 20 at the start.\nNICK\n12:11 \nYeah, which we recommend. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, I.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • For the sales team, they are using Confluence but need accountability and integration with Hubspot. \n• The Hubspot integration would involve data pulled into Hubspot to measure performance, such as number of calls and emails made. \n• There would be two groups in the platform initially: 10-15 internal sales personnel, and 20 external customers.

{"prompt":"FREDERICK\n12:15 \nToo small, nothing too big.\nNICK\n12:17 \nNo, no. Well, if it's you don't want to break it for everyone, right? So.\nFREDERICK\n12:21 \nYeah.\nNICK\n12:22 \nSo if it's broken, it's better to have with some trusted customers. I can give you some honest feedback that you feel good about. Same with employees. So cool. I was like to step back as well. I mean, you've given me…\nFREDERICK\n12:34 \nPretty good understanding.\nNICK\n12:36 \nOf, you know, the learners coming through sort of what's important to them and we'll dive a little bit more into that as well. But understanding sort of, you know, what's changed internally to drive this project for, to make this a priority. I mean, I know you mentioned you have a new role out of a website. I mean, you're new to the organization. It sounds like there's a lot of change happening. Is there anything specifically that you're looking to sort of impact by bringing in a tool like this? Any metrics or anything like that?\nFREDERICK\n13:06 \nWell, you know, I think at first again I'm looking to initially it's all about sales enablement. So it's the first thing is to have somewhere to the priority is to have somewhere to make it to put the sales training and to make it easy and have a lot less friction for the sales team… to onboard and to know what they're doing for those first 90 days. And we have transparency and accountability… that we could track and Hubspot. That's my main objective first off.\nNICK\n13:55 \nAnd as we flip over and I guess I should not like it's, always helpful to know your sales folks. Are they out in the field? Are they on foot? Are they internal or like doing tello tales? Like can you give me a sense of like what that looks like?\nAbout Docebo\nNICK\n14:10 \nSo it's always helpful to know sort of what their day to day is looking like and how itself into that?\nFREDERICK\n14:17 \nIt's it's a probably a good mixture of all. I think mostly it's on the phone. We certainly have a lot of sales people that go out and, you know, have their feet on the ground so to speak, you know, we have people that are working with, you know, trying to sell through partners and sell our products and, you know, upsell things for example, like there might be a partner that is more selling, you know, focusing on ucas, and, you know, we try to come in and, you know, talk to them about the value of having Stan or say, or something like that.\nPayment Gateway\nFREDERICK\n14:57 \nThey could sell to their base and, you know, how they can make more money. And then we also have people that are, you know, straight direct that are selling, you know, directly to and looking for suspects prospects out there in the market and selling directly to clients.\nNICK\n15:14 \nOkay.\nPayment Gateway ends\nNICK\n15:15 \nSo there's a good variety. Okay. Seen some flexibility there. Awesome. So, I know that that's the initial, you know, priority for you in terms of the external piece. I would like to understand like how important that is for your evaluation as you're selecting a tool like need to support that. Is that just a nice to have for down the road? I'm kinda.\nPayment Gateway\nFREDERICK\n15:38 \nI'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean? The external piece?\nNICK\n15:41 \nLike your customers like being able to Tray partners like anyone external to your organization, if you.\nFREDERICK\n15:47 \nUnderstood. Gotcha. Yeah, I think… that will, you know, and again, it depends on how well and how much we value the tool.\nPayment Gateway ends\nFREDERICK\n15:58 \nBut if it's if we do see the value and, you know, I could definitely see the value just by looking through some of the stuff on the site on your website. I believe then we would probably start with the customer base at probably the beginning of Q3 because we'd probably get some things put together. I think the beginning of the Q3 would be the latest.\nNICK\n16:22 \nOkay. So kind of phase two as you mentioned, get the internal piece, then the external piece. Awesome. And from like a, you know, if you were to partner with or anyone, right? And you look back at this in 12, six, 12 months, right? Is there any sort of measures of success that you're looking to have? Like things that we understand? I kinda get the internal piece, right? We talked about perhaps ramp time, getting them faster up to ramp?\nFREDERICK\n16:49 \nFic?\nNICK\n16:50 \nLess friction, right? Like just having that accessibility for your sales reps. I think I understand the internal piece quite off quite well. Probably an external standpoint as well. Is there anything from a customer, like of your customers, we asking for more training? Is it like a, you know, getting more, you know, reducing churn, getting more engagement out of the products that you're selling. Like I'm kinda curious to know if there's any success metrics on that side that you're looking at this project through as well?\nAbout Docebo\nFREDERICK\n17:22 \nNot at the moment, but I mean, definitely we would be looking at having some kind of way to present new products and services and make them really the top funnel kind of stuff. You know, just a lot of awareness and then education, yeah.\nNICK\n17:40 \nYeah, I know, for sure.\nAbout Docebo ends\nNICK\n17:41 \nI mean, we use it that way here. I mean, we use our own product to, as customers come in their new, right onboarding, but like how can we continue to land and expand, get their exposure to other things that are out there as well. And of course, new products and features that are coming down the line?\nFREDERICK\n17:57 \nI could totally see too like having, I'm sure there's a… even stuff with maybe one might not even need an account to log in to look at some of the stuff too, right? So we might have some of the, that kind of more globally accessible content too. I don't know.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Frederick is looking to implement a tool (e.g. Docebo) for sales enablement, prioritizing onboarding, transparency and accountability.\n• Sales people are a mix of on-the-ground, partners, direct customers, and new prospects seeking out clients.\n• Initial success metrics are ramp time and accessibility for sales representatives; potentially expanding to global content access without needing an account to log in.

I would love to see some more videos and how the platform actually works and how easy it is to implement this and, you know, and get our training loaded, get things set up. Lastly, I'd love to know some more if you could provide some more meat around how easy it is to integrate everything into Hubspot.\nNICK\n21:27 \nFor sure, Hubspot integration. Yeah, I'll see if I have.\nFREDERICK\n21:33 \nBecause that's I mean, the Hubspot integration is a cloud priority.\nNICK\n21:37 \nYeah, yeah, for sure. No, we, I mean, whether it's Salesforce Hubspot, whatever, you know, there, there's usually one mission critical integration with these things. So oftentimes you know, if it's on the HR side, it's like an HRIS platform. So I'm actually just looking real quick. I don't know if I have any… let me, I will do some digging on the Hubspot piece. I don't know if I have anything on like I mentioned, we have what's called the table connect, right? So I might share more general what that product does.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n22:11 \nAnd then we can set up a call with the solutions architect. Should you get to that point, just knowing that we can do it. It's just, I wanna make sure that, you know, we can kinda solution it for you and say, hey based on your workflows. This is what we recommend but we don't have anything necessarily.\nOnboarding ends\nNICK\n22:28 \nIt's going to be like out of the box, you just turn it on. It's gonna require a little bit of lift on your end that's that I'll be totally honest with.\nFREDERICK\n22:35 \nYeah, I think that makes sense.\nNICK\n22:37 \nYeah, I'm sure that's like pretty normal. I just sometimes you're like I just want to turn it on and it works.\nPricing\nNICK\n22:44 \nSo now, for sure, I think your expectations are pretty normal now with the pricing, I'll be honest just to give you an idea like you're looking at and especially for a sales enablement use case like for training your sales team, you're going to be looking anywhere between like 20 and 27,000 per year starting off and you'd be able to, for that price as well. You'd be able to Loop in your customers again. That will get you up to 300 active users per month. I know that's great. Yeah, we shared that with you. That doesn't deter you at all. So I can get you some pricing more solid pricing on that. The only other thing that might be a little bit, you know, might have a little bit of variability to it would be that integration, but we'll look at that in more.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n23:29 \nIt's always hard to get your pricing before we kind of solution everything for you, right? Cool. I'll get you all those things as a follow up.\nFREDERICK\n23:36 \nThank you.\nNICK\n23:37 \nIn terms of next steps and understanding your timeline… are you trying to have users live in the platform before any specific date? Is there anything driving that I…\nFREDERICK\n23:49 \nDon't have an event per SE or anything like that that's driving it. No, I would like to have it, you know, within the end of next month that's where I foresee it, you know, something for basically. Let me rephrase that. I would like to have the beginning of something like this on at the start of Q2.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n24:10 \nOkay. So start a Q2 sort of the, so the one thing I'll be fully transparent on is it's gonna take a little bit of time to get this thing set up right? From contract signature on words you're looking at about, you know, we enroll in a university. It takes a little bit of time to get going. You know, I always say it's about eight weeks to get a mini mobile product. So having, yeah, okay. I just wanna make sure I don't want to set you up for failure where you're like, hey, we're going to get this up and.\nFREDERICK\n24:40 \nI just mean, I'd like to have something settled?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Frederick has content ready to use on the platform and wants to deliver the training mostly through elearning. \n• There is a potential for an ILT depending on global requirements. \n• Nick offered options for demos, pricing (20-27,000 per year/300 users), and integration with HubSpot. \n• Their timeline to implement is beginning of Q2 with 8 weeks from contract signature projected for setup time.

{"prompt":"NICK\n24:43 \nGotcha. Okay. Gotcha. You wanna be, you wanna be building, right?\nFREDERICK\n24:48 \nYeah. Yeah. I would love us to have a handshake if you will by the beginning of Q2.\nNICK\n24:53 \nGotcha. Gotcha. No problems there. No problems there. Timeline. You wouldn't be surprised how many people want this up and live in a month and I don't want to failures.\nOnboarding\nFREDERICK\n25:04 \nUnderstand, I'm a little bit more technical savvy than most. I get what goes in.\nNICK\n25:09 \nI gotcha. No, I'm getting that sense. So, hey, man, I'll get you that in terms of kind of following up and having next steps, making sure that we're sorta continuing to help you. Would it make sense to schedule some time and, you know, next week to review some of the stuff that I've sent over like what would be?\nNext Steps\nFREDERICK\n25:26 \nYeah, that would be great. Let's look at the calendar. How about let's shoot for Friday because I got a pretty busy week next week actually.\nNICK\n25:37 \nThat, that I might.\nFREDERICK\n25:40 \nOkay. Let's how's Tuesday, the seventh?\nNICK\n25:43 \nSo, I'll be, yeah, I'll be, I'm off from the third and then the whole next week. So I'm happy to connect after that, but I don't want to push.\nFREDERICK\n25:51 \nNo, no, no, that's fine. I don't have to rush it. It's not like a liver dice situation, but yeah, how about Tuesday the fourteenth?\nNICK\n26:02 \nThat works for me. What's the best time for you?\nFREDERICK\n26:04 \nYou already, I'm sorry.\nNICK\n26:07 \nDid you say you?\nFREDERICK\n26:08 \nWere on.\nNICK\n26:08 \nEst, yup. Eastern. Yep.\nFREDERICK\n26:10 \nToronto. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, how's three PM your time? Yeah, that works. Okay, great. Just shoot me an invite and I'll accept right away and that sounds great.\nNICK\n26:22 \nPerfect. I'll put a reconnect in there. Awesome anything else beyond? So what I've got to share with your pricing, got some recordings for you so you can go through those there about 15 minutes in total.\nNext Steps ends\nNICK\n26:33 \nAnd then I'll get what I can around the Hubspot integration. It might be more general just around our connect product, but that's fine. Is there anything else beyond that would be helpful in the meantime?\nFREDERICK\n26:43 \nNo, just like you said too. Like if you get a little granular on that pricing where you said, it's like, I think like 22 for 300 users.\nNICK\n26:52 \nYeah, it's gonna get you up to 300.\nFREDERICK\n26:53 \nYeah, that's great. Just so I can have that number, so I could communicate and talk to my team about it because I'm gonna, you know, have a conversation with my cro because he's very interested in your product as well. So.\nWrap-Up\nNICK\n27:06 \nI love it. I love it. And hey, happy to talk about pricing. I think really for me next steps is if we reconnect, you have any questions, you wanna take a deeper dive, I'll bring in a solutions consultant. We'll talk about onboarding and what that looks like. And then of course, going through any sort of it validation specifically around that Hubspot piece, I'll bring in a solutions architect and we can do that, but just sort of that. But hey, thank you for the time, nice.\nFREDERICK\n27:32 \nThank you.\nNICK\n27:33 \nI think we'd be a great partner for what you're looking to do. So excited to get your feedback on the recording?\nFREDERICK\n27:40 \nYeah, excellent. Thank you so much. I might email you back sooner, just, you know, if I start seeing something on it, I'm like, you know, I want to chat you up a little bit. So I hope you don't mind.\nNICK\n27:51 \nI'll jump on a quick call whenever I'm easy. So we got something in the calendar but that's worst case, like if you need anything before, then you holler, I'm here, so.\nFREDERICK\n28:00 \nAll right. Cool. Thank you so much. Nick really appreciate it.\nNICK\n28:02 \nLove it. We'll talk to you. Thanks.\nWrap-Up ends\nFREDERICK\n28:04 \nAll right.

How are you doing?\nLEIGH\n0:21 \nThank you. How are you?\nERIK\n0:22 \nI'm good. And is it lay or Le? Okay, perfect. So, I'll see I was have to check. All right. Well, I see we are neighbors. I'm here in Austin, Texas.\nLEIGH\n0:32 \nHow are you?\nERIK\n0:33 \nRight down the street?\nLEIGH\n0:34 \nNice, right? So, I'm actually in Tennessee.\nERIK\n0:37 \nOkay. I…\nLEIGH\n0:38 \nJust in his.\nERIK\n0:40 \nThe organizations that you said, okay, you're in Tennessee?\nSmall Talk ends\nERIK\n0:42 \nOkay. Well, welcome in, anyway. Good. So I see that from looking at the notes you gave us already, you're kinda later on the process, you've already spoken to some vendors about this. My initial discussion with you is to really understand what the project is, make sure we're a great fit and kind of fast track you to that demo because it sounds like you're trying to get it knocked out by March, correct?\nOnboarding\nLEIGH\n1:07 \nYes, we are.\nERIK\n1:09 \nOkay. Awesome. I guess let's start. What is your role with the project? What will be your direct hands on experience with the project?\nLEIGH\n1:17 \nSo, I am, I'm collecting all of the data, trying to make sure that we're hitting some really key points with the platform that we're that we choose, and I'm presenting that to our entire organization. And then eventually I will be supporting it… once we get through an implementation.\nERIK\n1:39 \nSo, you will be the admin of the platform? Okay, awesome. So, this is a lot of your decision as well. And then in terms of that process, you said you'll present it after you make your selection, what does that look like? Hey, I've made multiple selections that we're going to have another round of demos or I've made one selection or are you basically say you decide which one and then go forward or is it multiple that kinda go forward to that next round?\nOnboarding ends\nLEIGH\n2:04 \nSo we've already gone through kind of one round and we have one that we're waiting to demo to our execs basically to see what they think about it. But we're still, we have a very different business model. So it's a little. We know that what we're looking at is there's a big possibility that we're going to present this one that we've kind of narrowed things down to and they're gonna say no because different reasons or they're gonna say, okay, yes. But then we have to purchase other platforms as well just to make it work. So right now, I'm just doing one or two at a time like I'll go through the process and I started with five. I narrowed it down to two and now down to one but still looking, so I…\nERIK\n3:02 \nAwesome. And it sounds like there is going to be in person as whereas virtual, you're gonna want tracking before we get too much into, hey, what features are you looking for? What kind of brought about the search? I know you're currently using. So I manage platform. What is it? What was it not doing? What's said? Hey, we needed an LMS.\nLEIGH\n3:24 \nSo it does not allow us to do the virtual learning. We actually went into a short contract with kajabi just to be able to launch a virtual learning platform. And it's very difficult. We would really like to find something that we can do both on because obviously, for the more platforms you're using, the harder it is to report on things, the more there's just a lot more work involved with seo. They also, the customer service is not the greatest. They do not respond. And a lot of times… my director, she is very knowledgeable in the actual build of platforms and implementations. She knows her stuff. And a lot of times she is telling them how to do their job. So I just… it's not been a great experience. They are awesome for event planning and management. But when it comes to actual classroom management, it's been a challenge.\nERIK\n4:39 \nOkay. So just this overall, it's just not a good fit and is another reason to this. Are you kinda growing?\nPricing\nERIK\n4:47 \nAre you planning for some scalability? Like, hey, we're going to have a lot more users. I see you had, I think 2,500 users come in this year. What is the planned Growth you expect for how many people you expect to be on the platform?\nLEIGH\n4:58 \nYou're expecting to double this year? Okay. So we want to at least be at 5,000 by end of year?\nERIK\n5:08 \nAnd one of the benefits of Docebo is we don't charge per license. So we charge on a monthly active user basis. So we have companies that have two five, 10,000 employees or users and they're only on like a 1,000 monthly active user plan because that's all that's monthly active into the system. So when you say the 2,500 came through this year, how many of those would you say come in on a monthly basis? Or if you get a guesstimate?\nLEIGH\n5:46 \nSo monthly, we see around it's about 250?\nERIK\n5:52 \nAwesome. Awesome. And you fit our model to the team. You fit our model to the T. Like, hey, we can have this many people were registered, but all we're paying for is this many monthly that's all it's coming in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Erik and Leigh had a discussion about Leigh's need for a virtual learning platform.\n• Leigh is responsible for collecting data, presenting the project to their entire organization and eventually supporting it with implementation.\n• Leigh has gone through one round of demos and narrowed it down to 1 option, but is still looking for additional ones that fit their business model better. \n• They are expecting to double their user base from 2,500 to 5,000 by the end of the year and Docebo’s pricing model charges on a monthly active basis.

{"prompt":"LEIGH\n6:01 \nNow…\nERIK\n6:05 \nWe kinda, we kinda touched on it with some of those, you have an event management system, but it's not quite fitting to Bill, you know?\nPricing ends\nERIK\n6:13 \nSo we get to go get a job for, you know, for the virtual part, you're looking for an all in one platform outside of those features that I already know about, what else are you looking for the LMS to do? What else do you want us? Like, hey, these are absolutely things we needed to do for.\nCourse Enrollment\nLEIGH\n6:26 \nWe need a registration process, a way to gather data, demographic data on our users, and then obviously report on that. And some of the registration process, it's different depending on the type of course that they're taking. We need a good integration with Zoom… something that's easy for our coaches to just basically open up and start a virtual class, you know, without having to worry about whether it's logged into the right person's Zoom, whether it's just let's jump in there, you know, and being able to duplicate courses.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nLEIGH\n7:20 \nWe have one course that we do every other week and it's a week long. It's every other week of the entire year. And so, being able to go in and set that up pretty easily for the entire year. Is very important. It's it can be a struggle.\nERIK\n7:42 \nI…\nLEIGH\n7:43 \nOf the big things, I mean, it can be very time consuming trying to just do individual, whether it's individual days or just setting each week up by on its own and then having to change everything whether it's a Zoom meeting or it can just be a lot. Then on top of that, we have other courses that are still going on throughout the week. So.\nLearning Plans\nERIK\n8:06 \nYeah. So on top of the one, the main one, you also have the other courses supplementing. Okay?\nLEIGH\n8:13 \nAnd then… we also need an option for like individual one on one classes whether it's virtual or just marketing in person.\nERIK\n8:26 \nAnd I'll pause you on that one when you say individual one on one.\nPayment Gateway\nERIK\n8:29 \nSo it's like, hey, I'm a student. I want to sign up and speak to this coach directly is, I guess I'll say a, what is the charging system look like or are the eCommerce aspect of this to?\nLEIGH\n8:44 \nAre anything?\nERIK\n8:46 \nOkay. So right now, you don't charge anything? Will there be a charge for any of this process?\nLEIGH\n8:51 \nNot this year, but eventually there will be some offerings that we charge for.\nERIK\n8:58 \nSo… and that's something we can discuss. Our platform allows for that. So we'll show you what that could look like when it said, hey, we do want to charge for this feature. Okay? We'll show you what that looks like within the platform as well.\nCustom Reports\nERIK\n9:11 \nOkay. And sorry, I cut you off while you're going to, I asked that question, what else did you have on there that's you're going through your, their list of like, hey, these are absolute features we need.\nLEIGH\n9:24 \nReporting is very important to us. We are a nonprofit and we have large donors that we have to report to on a quarterly basis. So those demographics that we're gathering from clients, we have to be able to report on that easily… where ideally, we want to be able to automate that process through, you know, an API. So that's very, that's high on the list.\nERIK\n9:57 \nAnd the doners, what, I guess, what are they looking for? The reporting? Just to be specific, what do they, what do they want to know?\nCustom Reports ends\nLEIGH\n10:05 \nSo, our organization works with hard to employ individuals, whether that's because they've had a difficult time just holding down a job or they've been incarsorated or just many it's all over the place. And so these downers, they're looking for age ranges, they're looking for the biggest one. We have to be able to capture like zip code, so we can put them in a region. We have to the salary base or income levels… gender… most of the basic demographic questions. Okay?\nLEIGH\n10:55 \nThere are a few questions in there that are, that get pretty specific like as far as how long somebody's been searching for a job, how if they've been able too, they're employed at the time of sign up or there are some of those questions that they also, we have to put a report on. But ideally, if we're able to put it into a registration page, we should be able to pull it out of the system.\nERIK\n11:24 \nAwesome. So kinda have like a, before you even get into the platform, you like a survey or something that says, hey answer these few questions about yourself before you register. Okay, boom now we have it, we can put that in our, into our reporting and you started down the path with kind of discussing the user. Could you kinda tell me what is the typical user that comes to this? You describe it pretty well. But what is your typical user? Who is your typical user?\nLEIGH\n11:47 \nSo the in person these users are, the platform needs to be fairly simple because even though they're in person and we have somebody there to support them in order to have a full class, we, it's a virtual and in person combination. So everybody's on a computer. So it needs, there needs to be some sort of it needs to be user friendly.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Leigh is looking for an all-in-one learning management system (LMS) to facilitate course enrollment, create learning plans, integrate with Zoom, and offer payment processing capabilities.\n• The LMS needs to include a registration process for data collection and demographic reporting.\n• It should also support automated reporting for donors with prompts for users on age range, income level, gender and zip code prior to registration.\n• Leigh's user base is a combination of virtual and in person participants who require a simple platform.

{"prompt":"LEIGH\n12:14 \nYou know, they don't need to have to search for how to enter a class or when their classes are coming up, a lot of them struggle with technology. So… the simpler the better I guess is what that comes down to.\nERIK\n12:36 \nAwesome. And in terms of… the, what they get when they come in and what they get when they come out, is there just one certification or what signifies that they finished a program? Anything like that?\nLEIGH\n12:49 \nWe do offer… it's not… like a full certification. It's our own internal, we present certificates that are then accepted around the community… as a type of certification.\nERIK\n13:09 \nThat's good. So that's another thing we do with a lot of our customers is something like, hey, this is a certificate from us.\nCertifications ends\nERIK\n13:17 \nYou can put it on your LinkedIn if you wanted to, you know, just something to show.

I know we have the virtual meetings and the courses. Is it video? Is it powerpoint documents? What stuff?\nLEIGH\n13:47 \nWe do. So. It's most of it is in person training. We do have a few of them that are or that is live training, not in person but live training.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nLEIGH\n13:57 \nWe have coaches that join these courses every single day and walkthrough everything. There are a few videos there's documentation and workbooks that, you know, we upload as PDF for users to be able to use. There are a few forms that they'll use to follow. But the majority of it is live.\nERIK\n14:30 \nFor the users themselves, will all of the work. So you saying they're going there, they're doing the computers, are they just doing the course there? And then they're submitting assignments there, would they ever have to record their screen or submit any sort of external assignments into this learning path?\nLEIGH\n14:48 \nNo, the users will not.\nERIK\n14:49 \nOkay.\nOnboarding\nERIK\n14:58 \nWonderful. And you kinda touched on the buying process already. But in terms of timeline, I know you said, hey, we're trying to make a selection by March. Is there a reason that you're trying to get it done by March?\nLEIGH\n15:09 \nJust, it's a goal that we have out there.\nOnboarding ends\nERIK\n15:16 \nAnd is there any sort of contract with seo still that you're like, hey, we need to get out or there's a month to month or how does that look?\nLEIGH\n15:24 \nWe'll be, we'll continue with as our event management, we do fundraising events and other large events, but no.\nERIK\n15:36 \nSo, looking for something to connect.\nIntegrations\nERIK\n15:38 \nAnd that really Roberts my next question in terms of integrations, picture, the LMS is going to be like the head of the octipus is gone. Everything's gonna connect to there. So, so you would likely probably want to have some connection there. Is there any other software that would connect to the LMS?\nIntegrations ends\nLEIGH\n15:52 \nWe also use net suite at this time, which eventually we as that as a CMS, eventually, we'll be moving away from that, that's one of my next projects.\nERIK\n16:04 \nOkay. It's like ey, we're gonna push out that suite initially. Would it be to Dale or you're like probably not at all that never, initially. Okay?\nIntegrations\nLEIGH\n16:12 \nTo connect?\nERIK\n16:14 \nAnd then you mentioned Zoom as well. So good integration with Zoom. Anything else you can think of integration wise?\nLEIGH\n16:25 \nWe use fibre for a reporting engine, but there are a couple of different ways that we currently… move that data over through. We use, make it used to be integramat.\nIntegrations ends\nERIK\n16:49 \nGood. You have all your, you got all the information just going and I, I've been asking questions for a little while here. So I always like to ask for you. So I know you know what this is going to do for the organization, but for yourself, what will change in your day to day once you have a learning management system implemented?\nLEIGH\n17:10 \nThe reporting is the biggest piece that, well, I, I'm hoping to change for myself because that's the biggest piece that I'm involved in. And then just troubleshooting because I get a lot of calls or emails, you know, saying I can't connect to this or this isn't allowing me to set this up the way that it usually does. And so just a lot of that… those one off, you know, just troubleshooting calls that's something that I'm really hoping to be able to put to bed and not have to deal with any.\nERIK\n17:47 \nYou're hoping to automate as many of the processes as possible. So it runs so smoothly that, hey, if it's a troubleshoot, it's a large problem, not like multiple little ones that they keep reaching out for.\nPricing\nERIK\n17:58 \nAwesome. Now, you kinda spoke to the… buying process for you. And I like to be upfront with… our pricing. So it sounds like from what you said, about 200 for the users a month. Our first tier is up to 300 monthly active users. That's our first tier. That cost is for the first year with onboarding cost is 25,000 for the first year. And then years two and three are 20,000. Does that put us within budget range for your project? So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Leigh's organization offers certificates as a type of certification that can be accepted in the community.\n• Course content consists of videos, documents, workbooks, and live training with coaches available to walk through everything.\n• Integrations include NetSuite, Zoom and Fibre for reporting.\n• Leigh is hoping to automate processes to minimize troubleshooting calls and emails. \n• Price for 200 monthly active users is 25,000 for the first year, 20,000 for years two and three.

So those we'll show you in the demo, those ease of use. Those are two things we pride ourselves on. So let's say our typical process. You meet me, I'm your colleagues, this initial contact. You have the solutions consultant that comes on. We give you an excellent demo to going from there, you're going into your solutions deployment manager where you're setting up the platform. And then you have your account manager that works with you directly to make sure everything's running smoothly. You are never alone with the platform that's just your top clear. Underneath there. You have support team. We have 24 seven support as well. So it was like, hey, it's like 12 and you might need to reach out to somebody. Hey, let me see it take. Let me speak to someone real quick on support. We can get them on the phone with you as well. So that's your regular support. If you wish to expand it, we do have paid for Professional services that's more. So if you said, hey, I need someone to build a custom integration into one of our other softwares or I need someone to really walk me down, purchasing decisions for expanding this project then, you know, you could pay for some Professional services as well. But no, out of the box, we have great support.\nOnboarding ends\nLEIGH\n21:11 \nOkay. All right. And I think really my biggest concern has been the Zoom and I believe that's one of the reasons that I started looking at your organization is because you handle zooms, learning management system. I believe… that kinda spoke volumes. So no, I can't think of anything else right now. You've pretty much answered everything.\nLayout & Content\nERIK\n21:39 \nGood. And you've answered quite a bit for me. I just had a couple more questions we were talking to that demo. It, we haven't made it yet. We personalize the demo based on this discussion. First off how big are you about branding? And then second off, what would you like to see in that?\nLEIGH\n21:59 \nSo branding… I can send you our logo and if this is going to be the same demo that I'll use to present to our teams, then yeah, we just want to keep some of the colors in, you know, keeping that same color scheme. But as far as branding, it doesn't have to be, you know, just… our pictures or anything. And if our logo is on there, that's great.\nERIK\n22:26 \nOkay. So yeah, as long as it looks like us, we're all right. Okay. And then in terms of what you want to see on the demo, this is your demo, we're going to show it to you. What do you want to see there? What, what's gonna make it?\nNext Steps\nERIK\n22:36 \nTypically the demo is an hour schedule, first 40 minutes, we're going through the tool you're asking your questions, and then we'll have a Q and a follow by next steps. What would make this a perfect demo for you?\nLEIGH\n22:46 \nA perfect demo would be seeing the setup of classes… or a class, even if it's just that main one that I was telling you about.\nNext Steps ends\nLEIGH\n22:57 \nThat is a week long… being able to see the registration forms and how to create those. And if that's something that would be done like… by your team and that I would not be setting up, then seeing one that is completed, that… let's see seeing it from the user perspective or the client perspective, how they would join a force and what it would look like from their side. And then also seeing it from the Instructor side, how they could log into a class to start a class. And then another big thing I just remembered I'm sorry, Spanish to English.\nERIK\n23:53 \nOkay, finish.\nLEIGH\n23:54 \nClear and easy way to do that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Leigh's main concern is with Zoom, learning management system and branding.\n• For the demo, Leigh wants to see the setup of classes, registration forms, a user perspective, instructor side view, and an easy way to switch Spanish to English.

{"prompt":"ERIK\n24:00 \nNow we could change just to directly answer that question. We change things in the platform to be Spanish English that are hard coded in the platform. But are you your materials themselves? I'm going to assume you've made courses in both languages already correct?\nCourse Enrollment\nERIK\n24:15 \nAwesome. Yeah. So we could show you that on the presentation as well. There was one question I did miss. So with the instructors, let's say I am an Instructor. Do I need to have direct access to whoever is just in my course or do all the instructors kinda work with everyone? So is it like, hey, if I signed up for eight am on Tuesday, I'm directly assigned to this Instructor for the rest of that course.\nLEIGH\n24:40 \nSo through speaking to our biggest class that week long, we'll have about usually we have three instructors that throughout the week will be teaching for one of the one or two of those days. But then we also have like an individual coaching. And once you're assigned to a coach that's your coach, okay? And then the other courses that we offer it's… each course will be just one Instructor.\nLEIGH\n25:23 \nThat big one is the only one that has multiple instructors throughout.\nERIK\n25:29 \nSo you're making your regular is perfect for us to really show you exactly what you're looking for.\nOnboarding\nERIK\n25:33 \nSo you regular too easy. Okay. I asked you quite a bit there. My only other questions. We kinda touched on budget decision making process. Obviously, you are a decision maker and then you will pass it up. What does that process look like? I guess who is next in line for say, hey, I like this one. What happens next after you say you found one?\nLEIGH\n25:57 \nI will take it to my director and she, will we'll just look at it together. Then I have two teams that I have to present it to… the team that will be actually setting up the courses. And then the kind of like the scheduling the ops support team.\nNext Steps\nLEIGH\n26:19 \nAnd then our programs team that includes all of our coaches… I present it to them. And if they, I try to answer as many questions of course. And if they're on board that's when we move on to the executives.\nERIK\n26:36 \nWonderful.\nERIK\n26:42 \nSounds good. My next step here is the pull up counters and get a schedule for that demo. Please ask any other questions on that you have?\nNext Steps ends\nLEIGH\n26:51 \nOkay. You've done a great job at answering everything and making this easy. So I really have anything else to ask?\nERIK\n27:00 \nThank you. Let's see what I can't believe we're already at the end of February just like that, which is good for weather wise. I'm happy it's sunny again.\nNext Steps\nERIK\n27:12 \nSo it keeps on moving. What does next week look like for you for an hour? I'm a Central Standard Time, you're Eastern Standard Time?\nLEIGH\n27:22 \nI'm central.\nERIK\n27:23 \nI'm sorry, is Tennessee central?\nLEIGH\n27:26 \nWhere I'm at, yes, I'm around Nashville, so.\nERIK\n27:29 \nDoes it switch at some point eastern?\nLEIGH\n27:31 \nYes, I…\nERIK\n27:32 \nOkay. Okay. All right. So, I'll learn something new today.\nLEIGH\n27:37 \nSo, next week, Tuesdays and Thursdays are always the best days for me… to.\nERIK\n27:44 \nThursday, the second is wide open.\nLEIGH\n27:47 \nI'm open then as well.\nERIK\n27:49 \nOkay. So let's say 11 am central. Would that work for you?\nLEIGH\n27:54 \nYes, that's perfect.\nERIK\n27:59 \nSo, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna outside of this invite you'll get here shortly. I'm also going to send over just a quick 10 minute YouTube video showing you the platform just kinda like this is, hey, this is a table. This is what we look like. And I'll also send over a list of 20 features that our customers absolutely love. Just like a, hey, this is what customers have about the table. So you kinda already have a feel for us prior to that demo.\nNext Steps ends\nLEIGH\n28:19 \nOkay. That'll be great.\nERIK\n28:25 \nAwesome. You should get this invite here shortly. No, that you made a quick and easy, you had all the answers already. So I can tell you've been gotta going through this process. I didn't ask that if you are at liberty to say, who would you say is your top competitor right now or competitors?\nLEIGH\n28:43 \nThe only other platform that we're considering right at this moment is Arnold.\nERIK\n28:51 \nAnd that's what you said you've already selected them to do to move up kinda move forward kinda.\nLEIGH\n28:56 \nOkay. Yes.\nERIK\n28:58 \nAll right. We are up against learn world. Sounds wonderful. Well, thank you for joining me and thank you for the new fact.\nNext Steps\nERIK\n29:07 \nI now know that Tennessee is half central, half eastern. So that is something I did not know. I learned today if you think of any other questions before now and the demo, please do reach out and we can get that including the demo or I can answer those for you directly.\nWrap-Up\nLEIGH\n29:18 \nOkay. All right. Sounds good. Thank you so much for your time.\nERIK\n29:20 \nThank you.

{"prompt":"SAVANNAH\n5:13 \nPerfect. Well, I think we're all start before we dive into everything. Is there was quite a big team on the list and I was curious about how you all work together and kinda who was under which side of the house in terms of the internal and external?\nSAVANNAH\n5:31 \nWhoever one's got, don't be shy, whoever.\nNICOLE\n5:32 \nWow. That's…\nKELVIN\n5:34 \nI'll go first. I am one of the instructional designers here. So I will be in charge of probably uploading the content and creating some of the content for the LMS… store. It's our fearless leader. He's the chief… Nicole is the manager of training. So hopefully that can kinda crystalize what our roles are, and we'll be directly and indirectly involved in either uploading and producing some the content. I am familiar with how to set up an LMS. And I'm really fun of your product. When I was at my previous organization, I was trying to convince them to switch over to your product, but they said no, so… you know, so hopefully the second time around will be successful onboarding because I really like the whole artificial intelligence curation process… and that's something that I will be interested in seeing or getting a demo off and any other features that differentiate you from other LMS. And what is your track record in terms of stability? When, I mean stability in the past, when I was engaged with other LMS, because I was the administrator for the last one that I was engaged with, I had problems with scorn content freezing on me. I have to manually go in and mark people completed. So we want a solution that will have a minimum of that happening. So hopefully that will answer some of your questions.\nSAVANNAH\n7:38 \nYeah, it totally does. And it's always nice to meet a Docebo fan. Of course, I work here. So I tend to be a Docebo fan myself, but I think we can show you some things that you already like, and also talk about some things that are really specific to the goals that you all want to accomplish. And Kelvin, I'll ask real quick just for my notes. What are you creating your score packages in today? They like.\nKELVIN\n8:04 \nI'm using articular 360, and then we have a Berta reality solution that we're working on that may be linked inside the Docebo. And I'm also… wanted to know how do you handle hosting external links and marking completions with those links or what do we have to do to have the APIs communicate with each other? So we might have other third party stuff that needs to be implemented and that needs to kinda talk. Ohio needs to talk to it. So it will be good to know about those things as well?\nSAVANNAH\n8:47 \nAbsolutely. Yeah, we have tons of options there from how you host that content and experience how you report on it and get all the data and fun things that you need for your learning program. So we'll absolutely talk about it. And as we kind of progress we'll probably dedicate a little bit of time to that. And if you could let us know like what you're using there for that VR, that would help too. But to kind of back it up to a more kind of more broad approach like I'm curious to hear about the separate programs with your internal and your external Audience. Like are you doing training with each Audience today? Is any of this a new endeavor for you?\nKELVIN\n9:26 \nFor my part, based on the knowledge that I know, I will say it's a new endeavor. It's a new implementation I do not know and store and call can jump in and a test to the number of people who will be trained, but I believe it's hundreds of people and they're mostly external facing, I believe. And then there's a few of them who are gonna be internal, but the exact numbers I cannot give you at the moment.\nSAVANNAH\n9:57 \nThat's okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's totally fine. I was more curious to understand a little bit about, you know, what you are doing and, you know, why you want to change it up.\nSTUART\n10:10 \nYeah. So we do not own an LMS, we leverage our clients. LMS is if they have one, if they don't have one, then obviously, that leaves us in alerch for storing content that is trackable in any sort of manner. I'm less concerned about the internal, which a lot of the MS that I've looked at have where they have a lot of AI generate machine learning based on the algorithm that you're using here's. The Amazon lists playlist of videos and E books and stuff like I'm less concerned about that, you know, the LinkedIn type of article source information. I'm more concerned about the, is there any native software for development in the system… so that we don't have to use Articulate all the time, you know, that we can do similar projects that you have native software to build out content with. And also our go forward plan is leveraging like Kevin said, virtual reality software. And how does that play in when we're running that type of scenario?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Kelvin is an Instructional Designer responsible for uploading content and creating content for an LMS store.\n• Nicole is the Manager of Training.\n• Stuart has learned from prior experiences working with other LMSs and has questions about stability and integration of third-party services.\n• They are seeking native software for development, as well as the ability to integrate virtual reality platforms into their learning program.\n• They do not currently own an LMS, they leverage their clients LMS if they have one.\n\n END"}
{"prompt":"SAVANNAH\n11:23 \nGotcha. Gotcha. Okay. So if you're not looking for, and I think, let me kinda start by saying, I think you're landing in a great place with Docebo because something that we do very well is we serve more than one Audience, and we're able to serve that external Audience very well. So being able to serve up a unique experience to them is not a problem hosting different types of content in Docebo. Is also not a problem. You don't have to build out everything and scorm. And in fact, something we know for straight up fact is that things don't have to be perfect and beautiful and scorm for them to get the point across, right?\nSTUART\n11:56 \nYou hold you too.\nSAVANNAH\n11:58 \nYes, actually, I was just at a training conference and they did a session on like tick talk style training and just like meeting people where they're at, with what they need and I was thinking I literally just looked up how to bake a whole chicken and I went to tick top.\nSTUART\n12:15 \nLike just…\nSAVANNAH\n12:16 \nGive it to me fast. Yes. Yes. So in Docebo, you don't have to just use scorm, you can use all kinds of different learning objects from, you know, using something external that's to just a simple video powerpoint, something quick to get the point across. And we also have a content generation tool that's not meant for instructional designers necessarily. So it's not gonna compete with like what Kelvin is an expert in. It's more like, hey, you have this concept, how can we quickly turn it into a digestible piece of content without taking, you know, two weeks to do it, you could do it in an afternoon. So stuff like that, you're definitely gonna find with Docebo. Stuart… one of my questions around that customer training. So right now, if you have content, you're sending it out to the customer. If they have an LMS, and they can put it in there?\nSTUART\n13:08 \nThat's one methodology. Sometimes they provide us with their own content that resides on their LMS… and we just, we… virtual desktop in to their environment and use it there.\nOnboarding\nSAVANNAH\n13:25 \nOkay. Now, I wanna, I want to understand a little bit about the customer journey as well because, you know, I work in software. So I know that like when a customer joins on, there's that beginning part of the journey. And then there's the continuation of that for as long as they're your customer.\nOnboarding ends\nSAVANNAH\n13:41 \nAre you focusing a lot of this on like new customers who have just come on and their onboarding with you? Or are you kinda thinking about it in different phases? Yeah.\nSTUART\n13:50 \nYeah. So.\nNICOLE\n13:51 \nWith me?\nSTUART\n13:52 \nOn on. Yeah. So we no all good. So we have 11 brick and mortar call center office buildings globally.\nSAVANNAH\n14:02 \nYeah. Okay.\nSTUART\n14:04 \nWhen we have an account, we do, we answer the phones for any number of companies that are out there in the world. Today. When we answer the call to explain your Bill to change your cell phone service, whatever it is to your electric Bill, your water Bill, you get whatever that Bill, you know, Bill discussion… Gloria, is that… I, by her other name? Yes. Okay.\nANGELICA\n14:31 \nRight. That was my first name. Yeah, you can get me and jelly. Sorry for being.\nSTUART\n14:35 \nYeah. Okay. So we have these different sites. When we get a new client, they come to us with a PDF or a powerpoint or maybe good E learning… and they say here, you know, this is the training content, use it exactly embellish upon it. Make it better, do whatever you want with it because it's terrible. It's from 1990. It's a PDF users manual. Can you do something better with this? We want to go, we wanna go to you today's. The beginning of month. By the end of the month, we need people on the phones answering the calls. So that's why I asked you have simple software that allows that I don't need to tell Kelvin, create the Mona Lisa. I just need someone to finger paint and get something, get it out there. You know, reasonable that we could piece together. I could train trainers, higher skill set, trainers who could take that content, digest it and help create something on a rapid agile basis.\nSAVANNAH\n15:37 \nOkay. Okay. Gotcha. That absolutely helps. All right. So, maybe I was misunderstanding what that external Audience is there. So that helps for sure. Thank you for painting the picture fully for me. It's sometimes it's hard to get in there and get on the ground with you. And that's where I wanna be right? If you're gonna move forward. So.\nSTUART\n15:53 \nWe're doing, we do a lot of new hire training for a client because we're handling their calls. And in our sites in bogatah, we have 10 different clients in a multi story building and we have hundreds of people in that building. So, a 1,000 people in the building, so to speak. Yeah. So.\nSAVANNAH\n16:18 \nGotcha.\nSTUART\n16:18 \nAnd then there's always new training because people leave and you have to hire a whole new group of people. So you hired and normally, our classes are about on average, I'll say 20 per new hire class.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Stuart provides call center services for a variety of companies and customers, sometimes requiring training. \n• New hire classes generally average 20 people per class. END"}
{"prompt":"SAVANNAH\n16:31 \nOkay. Okay. And you gotta get them okay off the ground quickly so that they can get on the phones and help our customers, right? Okay. Gotcha. That makes sense. So, I'm curious also just kinda the concept of all right, we gotta get them on the off the ground fast, get them on the phones. What about if they're like in the flow work? And maybe they have a question? Like do you want the LMS to serve your audiences in that way too? So like they've gone through their onboarding, they're checked off.\nSTUART\n17:02 \nIf you have knowledge, if you have a knowledge management element of some sort to MS in it, then you have to be interested to hear about that.\nSAVANNAH\n17:09 \nOkay. Got it.\nSTUART\n17:10 \nRole play scenario. You know, what whistles and bells come with your product?\nSAVANNAH\n17:14 \nOkay. Good to know. And Jelica, you just popped in. Anything burning questions top of mind for you?\nANGELICA\n17:27 \nSorry, I was muted, no, not really. I mean what Stuart said is just basically what we need right now. We need an efficient, you know, learning system where people can find content easily that can help them clarify questions, reduce like the amount of work that the training team has to do by themselves. You know, we need something great that works because we do a lot of training here. We do a lot of coaching as well. We need visual aids. We need something dynamic that they can use something different than deck. So of course. Yeah. What's Stuart set pretty much summarizes that. So, thank you.\nSAVANNAH\n18:02 \nOkay. Perfect. One thing I'm curious about just to make sure I'm tracking with your goals and why they're important to you? Is I saw in the note, you know, you want to have something up and going in three months. Why in three months? Tell me what's going on around that?\nSTUART\n18:22 \nWhy do we want this up and running in three months? Yeah, because I need to move us off of this old environment that we're doing. You know, Kelvin has been on with the company for two months. I've been on for four months and there, there has been no formalized in structural design methodology or training plan. So I'm going to implement that and this is a tool that's necessary to execute the plan.\nANGELICA\n18:54 \nAnd I, so I have to say that that's an issue we're having at the company right now. We need to improve the onboarding and the training processes a lot because they are, you know, empty spots. We have people who are very intelligent and prepared, but they just, they were promoted from one role to the other. So perhaps they don't have like that experience in teaching certain things or how to lesson plan or how to work with curriculum with platforms. So of course, we also need that for that. And we need it like a really fast that's…\nSAVANNAH\n19:30 \nGotcha. I'll tell, you know, the thought behind that question is I just wanted to make sure if you were going to say, hey, we're hiring 300 people in three months or something else is expiring in three months like that's all good stuff to know, you know, as a part of it, right? So that's just want to understand why those goals. Are those goals? Okay. I have a good bit of information and ideas kind of floating through my head. I would love to schedule a demo with your team to kinda walk you through all of these different aspects and bells and whistles and things that can help you before we do that? Is there any questions that you wanna ask me that, you know, are like super important to how you're gonna make this decision? And you wanna know today before you decide to spend more time.\nSTUART\n20:13 \nSo… does your system reside on our server or is this cloud based?\nSAVANNAH\n20:19 \nIt is, yes, it's software as a service. So we'll host it for.\nSTUART\n20:24 \nOkay. Tied in with our exchange, single sign on, is that?\nSAVANNAH\n20:34 \nWe do support single sign on. Do you know what methodology you're using there like Octa or excuse me, SAML, or anything like that?\nSTUART\n20:42 \nNo, I'm not sure which one it is. It's one of the easy major brands, but yeah.\nSAVANNAH\n20:46 \nYeah, not a problem. It's not a red flag. We can tie in and, you know, we can do single sign on. We can provision or create users from a lot of different places and in a lot of different ways as well. Okay? What I would encourage is like things like that, like Kelvin your VR stuff. If you could kinda think about, hey, what's this vendor? We're creating this VR tool with, you know, what would that link be? If you can send that to me? I can test it for you. And like Stewart, if you think all right, what's the easy way to get these people in where my team doesn't have to do anything hands on.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Stuart discussed the importance of knowledge management, role play scenarios, and whistles/bells that come with the product.\n• Angelica acknowledged the need for an efficient learning system with visual aids that is fast and dynamic.\n• Savannah asked why they wanted to have something up and running in three months; it was revealed they need to move off an old environment, improve onboarding/training processes, and build a formalized/structural design methodology/training plan. \n• Stuart asked whether the system resides on their server or is cloud-based, which Savannah confirmed as software as a service. \n• Savannah suggested providing vendor links to test VR tools, as well as looking into easy ways to get people into the system without manual intervention.

Okay.\nOnboarding\nSTUART\n24:21 \nI will do my best to, I will do my best to attend.\nNICOLE\n24:24 \nHow?\nSAVANNAH\n24:27 \nSo, if you can't attend or if you need to shift it, you'll just let me know, but I record everything because I want for you to have access to it too. So we will make sure we do that what I would recommend after the demo just, you know, thinking about what your next steps might be if you're liking what you're seeing if Kelvin recommendation is good, we'll talk about like pricing and packaging this up for you and how we can get you to your success and get this off the ground fast so that you can get folks in there and start reaching these goals. So that would be some of the next steps we would talk about if you're liking what you're seeing in the demo. And then things like how you're going to get folks in and talking about the VR stuff with Kelvin and how that would work for your team. We can talk about that kind of simultaneously.\nWrap-Up\nSTUART\n25:15 \nOkay. Awesome.\nSAVANNAH\n25:19 \nI've held that time on my calendar. Is there, can I just repeat like who's on the calendar invite for today or is there any additional attendees that I need to consider?\nSTUART\n25:30 \nYeah, I think this is the team, right?\nSAVANNAH\n25:34 \nAwesome. Well, I can take care of that.\nWrap-Up ends\nSTUART\n25:37 \nAnd will you also be presenting at the, in April in vegas at calls? Is it contact center week or not? Call center week? I forget whose, which show that is. I know you go out to a lot of the trade show, a lot of the call center show.\nNext Steps\nSAVANNAH\n25:52 \nWe, we do, I know we're going to one in vegas, but I'm not sure if it's that one. If you tell me.\nSTUART\n25:59 \nI can.\nSAVANNAH\n26:00 \nCheck…\nSTUART\n26:00 \nCall and contact center expo. I think it is, yeah, call and contact center expo. I am.\nSAVANNAH\n26:08 \nSure.\nSTUART\n26:09 \n26, 27.\nSAVANNAH\n26:10 \nCause…\nSTUART\n26:12 \nI'll be at that show with my team also, so.\nAbout Docebo\nSAVANNAH\n26:15 \nCool. I will ask one of our endeavors this year. We've typically gone to a lot of like learning industry related expos especially the big ones like of learn at D and we're trying to branch out and go to more industry, you know, like more general expos that we fit into, but aren't just learning focused. So I'll definitely ask my team.\nWrap-Up\nSTUART\n26:36 \nThere's the link.\nSAVANNAH\n26:37 \nSweet. Thank you.\nSTUART\n26:40 \nMake your life easy. There you go.\nSAVANNAH\n26:42 \nThanks. You knew, I was gonna go Google it.\nSTUART\n26:44 \nYeah, I just, I knew what I was though, I fumbled where I was going to be so, okay, good.\nSAVANNAH\n26:49 \nNo, you're all good. Well, I'm excited about this. Thanks for taking a few minutes to help me get on the ground with you so that I can show you Docebo in regards to what's gonna matter to you and we can talk about it. The last thing I wanna do is get a demo and be like, hey, Stuart, this is a menu. This is what this does, like we wanna talk about what your goals are and not bore you to death in an hour. So that's the plan and I appreciate you helping me with that. So if anything else comes up, you'll let me know, but otherwise, you'll get that invite from me very soon.\nSTUART\n27:18 \nThank you.\nSAVANNAH\n27:19 \nSounds good. Awesome. All right, you.\nNICOLE\n27:22 \nThank you.\nANGELICA\n27:23 \nBye bye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Savannah and the team discussed setting up a backend solution that aligns with the learning management system.\n• They decided to set up a demo on Thursday, March 2nd at 4PM EST to discuss what data is needed and the best recommendation for Savannah's side.

{"prompt":"SCOTT\n0:00 \nHey, Fernando. Good.\nFERNANDO\n0:02 \nGood morning.\nALI\n0:04 \nGood morning, Fernando. How's it going?\nFERNANDO\n0:06 \nPretty good yourself?\nALI\n0:08 \nGood, Fernando, I got Scott here. He's my ae, he's gonna just kind of try to get a little bit more information so we can personalize a demo for you guys sooner. Yeah.\nFERNANDO\n0:24 \nYeah. So basically our company, we with the, is arco, the airport. So we have acquired these LMS, what was in 2020 just around the COVID… to be able to provide the, a platform for our trainers to provide the training online. So I use the LMS… we don't know, we don't use it anymore. We, most of our training is done in person, but we still keep the LMS the ILT and use it as a, as kind of roster or for our records.\nCourse Enrollment\nFERNANDO\n1:03 \nBut yeah, it's always good to have at least that option. We know this COVID phase five or seven will come back ever again, but it's always good to have a platform that we can actually use for ILT or virtual training. We are a Microsoft kind of a company. So we use teams, we use all the Microsoft products. So an interaction with or with Microsoft teams will be.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nSCOTT\n1:36 \nOkay. Yeah.\nFERNANDO\n1:38 \nApart from that. So right now we use Learnupon. So it's been two, three years with them. We just wanted to see what's out there. What are the features we can get? I know some of the things that our trainers normally say is that they want to have more tools to create quizzes and exams. So basically, you know, right now we had a third party authoring tool that one is, I think is from Ispring… to create kind of like quizzes and things like that. So, but they do also have everything to one platform, I would say.\nSCOTT\n2:23 \nOkay, perfect. Yeah. And I can introduce myself too. So I'm an account executive here at the, and, you know, I really appreciate you taking time with us, Fernando. It sounds like did we catch you at the right time when we reached out? Like are you just starting to look at potential?\nFERNANDO\n2:36 \nTo look at that, we, our renewal date is in June, but it just that because of our, the way how we do the training, we need to have something or established on agree on by may because not only in June… we get all the trainers from all the stations and we review all the changes. And then if ever we, we're going with the new LMS, it means that we need to provide the proper training and all that.\nSCOTT\n3:08 \nGotcha. Okay. No, that's great. I mean, I've definitely got a few like questions kinda like what caught your attention or what's making you potentially switch here. Were you part of the procurement? Did you, were you part of the team that picked Learnupon back in 20?\nFERNANDO\n3:21 \nYeah. I like, I recall during the time in 2020 when we did… the request for service, I know this was one of those, but I think the prices were not, we're almost double what we were getting from the other system. So yeah, I think mainly was a, it was a question of price at one point.\nSCOTT\n3:48 \nGot you. And with Learnupon, obviously, I'm going back to 2020, I could only imagine the airline industry and, you know, a big shift to obviously maybe E, learning virtual L, that type of stuff. What was kind of like the pickup like have you liked that strategy of going to that sounds like you've transitioned back to more Instructor led training?\nPricing\nFERNANDO\n4:05 \nNo, I think this is something that we're gonna keep it. It's just that because we're I think, I know special because we are seasonal. So there are some times that we like end of summer and fall. We're very recent training. So that's where all our users, you know, the active users, how they normally charge all this, that's where we take a, and then January, everything slows down. So basically we shouldn't have any more training. It just follow up. So that works for let's say the payments of the annual fee and all that. We base ourselves about 500 to 501,000 employees. It all depends. But something that we did, we start using the system to send out bullet.\nPricing ends\nFERNANDO\n4:57 \nSo let's say we prepare a memo or with, you know, a safety campaign or something like that, and we send it out. Then we ask all the employees to read and sign it or read it. So that created three is like an active user, so they say, but, you know, so, you know, you are, you know, using too much. So right now, I'm reviewing that. Do I need to get another software to take care of all the publications or can I use the LMS without, you know, an impact on the cost, you know, because we want to get into, you know, anyway, I think that's something to review for the pricing basically.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Fernando is responsible for the training platform at his company, which is currently using Learnupon.\n• They have been using this platform for two to three years, but are now looking for other options with more features and better pricing. \n• Fernando is considering a third party authoring tool from Ispring and integration with Microsoft Teams.  END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n5:43 \nYeah, for sure. Well, what's your strategy around training? Like what it sounds like? Obviously you've got the seasonal, the kind of the initial rush, but is it mostly like onboarding? Do you have long term employees are looking to upscale? Like what's kind of like your main priorities for training?\nFERNANDO\n5:58 \nThat's that's something that we have other platforms. So we use a platform called per IP, which is part by Skillsoft to take care of all this, the sub skill. So basically, and also the mandatory courses, health and safety, all the PP, et cetera. So we use per cpa for that for sure, ideally will be to get everything to one place, but we haven't seen that many MS with good content covering the compliance training.\nIntegrations\nFERNANDO\n6:37 \nYeah. And all that normally, we have packages for the accounting. So Microsoft products… and leadership as well. That's what we have packages in per cpa for leadership. So they have leaders, they have everything about her, aspen. So all those legal phone courses there. So, so, yeah. So we have a different platform for that.\nIntegrations ends\nSCOTT\n7:06 \nSo it sounds like, are you considering like consulting that? Like if that could be in one platform?\nFERNANDO\n7:11 \nThe ideal, yes, that will be the ideal. It's just that we just renew with per again for two years. Okay? But yes, that's you know, at the end of the, at the end of the day and all. And then training, it will be easier to manage if we have only one platform that covers everything.\nIntegrations\nSCOTT\n7:30 \nOkay. And the only reason I bring that up, so I think the like our position is like we're a pretty holistic LMS, we've actually got a content library of about 90,000 courses, too funny enough. I know Skillsoft, I know recipes kind of, you know, their lightweight LMS that accompanies their content rate. If you buy their content, they've got a way for you to deliver it, but Skillsoft is actually part of our network of content providers too. So, you know, it sounds like obviously you've got a little bit more time on your contract but it would make a ton of logical sense that you could even still use some of their content but have access to our external content where we've got a ton whether it is leadership. We've got compliance here, sexual harassment, if it is more, you know, safety hazard materials type like I'm not sure kind of what those topics are, but typically really good coverage there too. So there would definitely be a strong case to kinda have that built into one. But obviously, we'd have to talk about timing with the existing contract and how you make that work. So what does the, what does Learnupon? Then if, you know, percipio's doing all that, what's kind of Learnupon specific?\nIntegrations ends\nFERNANDO\n8:39 \nWe use Learnupon for all our internal training. So all the anti training that we got, we use it there. So right now, we have… different stations. So we provide the content. Some of them is a voice over, so the employees they log in, they read and, or listen to the courses. Yeah, we got different courses that we have. So that's what we use for Learnupon or internal training basically?\nSmall Talk\nSCOTT\n9:12 \nAnd outside of your bulletins that you're doing now, are they, you said they're all kinda coming in August, September, October leading up to the season?\nFERNANDO\n9:20 \nNo, the bulletins are mainly during the season. So our teasing season depends on the stations. It goes from October first. Most of the stations, October first to April 30 first.\nPricing\nFERNANDO\n9:32 \nWe have three stations that I start early which is September first to may 30 first. So those are kind of our official the in season. So that's where we got the majority of our people. So a month or month and a half before that we start training, some people.\nPricing ends\nFERNANDO\n9:51 \nGosh, it's just that we don't have is not a set date because we got initial or new employees. They get trained that during that time or pretty much until December, I would say we have different classes coming in till December. And then January or March is pretty much that, you know, then may and June is mainly us the head trainers working on the content, preparing the platform to receive everybody back… in August and September. So we will start training again.\nSCOTT\n10:30 \nGotcha. Okay. And just so I understand too. And I think this kinda helps me put it in context. But like who exactly are you training? Are these the people that are out actually like operating the dicing? Is it everyone from like management or like who I guess, are you training?\nFERNANDO\n10:45 \nRight now, which is only the people are the is, so that's our target people. If let's say we go with per cpo combine everything into one, then yes, we'll have our management manager as well to train them and, you know, up skill and everything. But now that's what we use for CP for… and Learnupon for all the technical training.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Fernando uses several platforms to deliver training, including Percipio and Learnupon, with the former focused on compliance-based training and the latter for internal training. \n• The peak season for training is from October 1st - April 30th, with some stations having a longer season of September 1st - May 31st. \n• Training is primarily aimed at people responsible for operating the dicing, but will include management if they switch to a single platform. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n11:15 \nTrying. Okay. Awesome. I mean we talked a little bit about content too. So I'm familiar with Ispring. I know they've got like a scorm converter type of there. What's kind of in like the limitations there? What are you trying to do that? Maybe it hasn't been able to.\nFERNANDO\n11:31 \nSo that's one of the issues that we have with Learnupon is that if we use the con files, it seems that it creates a problem with their own grade. So let's say we make an exam and within the exam, there's a grade. So it creates some questions and give them.\nCertifications\nFERNANDO\n11:49 \nBut once you add them in Learnupon, and you create a module and everything within their system, it grades as well. So sometimes it creates a conflict. So say that, you know, you had a 90 percent on the exam, but then their system shows differently 60 percent completion. So that creates some issues for us.\nCertifications ends\nFERNANDO\n12:12 \nSo right now we're using, we stop using the Ispring for the exams, and we're using their tool right now. But it is very limited, you know, Ispring has good features, you know, the upload a picture, you can ask, you know, the user to choose or to point the right answers. So there are more kind of features on how we can create the question. So, but just to avoid the issue of having, because I create some problems with auditors, let's say, okay, is this a 90 percent or 60 percent? What it is? So, but ideally for us is to have a good tool to create exams? And also because our industry requires us to or the employee to completely to 100. So basically let's say we have a minimum pass mark of 80 percent. But then we need to prove that the employee review the question that he got wrong. So I've been taking some other training from some airlines that they have these elements and one of the options that they have, they keep asking some of the same questions until you get them. All right, let's say 50 questions and you pass 80 percent, but you have five errors. Then they bring back again the buyer. And until they pass that's how they manage to prove that it was corrected to 100. Right? Now, what we've been doing is we created an extra kind of a module or an assessment type of module that you have reviewed or just an statement saying you have review and correct? And that's…\nSCOTT\n13:57 \nYeah. Okay. You've got some options there. I mean you could do, you could set like a temp limits and like re, tries and basically, you know, if you want to provide feedback, suggest like which section they should review and then come back to complete the test, you could always do a few things like that. But yeah, I mean we pair well with Ispring too. So I know there are platforms out there. They say they're scorm compliant, but they struggle on the reporting side like they can play it no problem. So, I think that's fairly common. From what I've heard. I haven't heard about Learnupon specifically. It does tend to be an advantage for us and I would say like obviously the best way to really know is to test it out our platform like as we move forward, go through a demo, get you a trial, let's upload one of your Ispring tests and just play with it through Docebo. So that's probably the best way to do it. But I know I've definitely had quite a few clients that have used Ispring for just like powerpoint to scorm conversions too. So.\nFERNANDO\n14:54 \nThe other feature that we'll be looking for within the system and element system is to keep track of our practical training. So right now we're using an in house so forth, but it's quite all. And so at this point we're looking into, do we spend some money in update and upgrade that so forth? Or do we find something else out there that has both? So to keep track of the practice. Basically once we finish the theory, these employees they are taking out and go through certain checklists to see the employee will basically to teach them how to operate the equipment. Yeah. So for that, we have some requirements is basically to keep track of the time that we spend training them. We have the checklist with the criteria and then to make sure that we cover all the criteria. So it's kind of a check checkbox. You know, I, I've gone through this with this with the employee. And then at the end is kind of an assessment that the, or a sign up. So basically the employee has completed everything and he's found that the save and proficient to operate equipment. So that's kind of the final sign up and this is done per equipment. So if a station have three or five different types of equipment, it needs to have this per kind of the family of the equipment.\nSCOTT\n16:20 \nGot you. Okay. And I think like the best way to do that just like from our system. And obviously, I'm not in a demo mode here. We do have a functionality called checklist which is typically used in that like on the job training… type of learning. But yeah, I mean, I think you create courses tied to, you know, your specific equipment, you could have the checklist that could be owned by not sure.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott and Fernando discussed the limitations of using Ispring's SCORM converter. \n• Learnupon has an issue with grading when Ispring is used, and so they are using their own tool right now which is very limited.  END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n16:41 \nIs it like do you have like a trainer, like titles, are they the ones kind of evaluating or who's kind of looking at those lists?\nFERNANDO\n16:48 \nDifferent Instructor. We call them practical trainers. Okay. So yeah, I know we have to look into what the, what access if we can limit it to only those type of courses. Yeah, I guess it will be easier to.\nSCOTT\n17:04 \nWell, that's what we typically do. We've got like this Power user functionality. So you could have like a profile that could be, you know, field trainer that manages that they can go through. They can go through the checklist, mark them as complete, not complete, go through a variety of different tasks.\nUser Permission ends\nSCOTT\n17:18 \nMaybe they need to see, you know, done to satisfaction or like did not meet expectations, that type of stuff. And then again, yeah, having multiple courses for maybe multiple machines that you have. So I think there's definitely ways to do it. And it sounds like you said like that platform that you're using today is something that's you're kind of deprecating…\nFERNANDO\n17:38 \nYeah. It is, it isn't in house. You know, it serves the purpose. It's just that, you know, all software. They don't look that well and people will like, but it, you know, keep track of the training. It's a good tool overall. But at this moment, I would say, you know, if we can have everything to one system that will be the best. This is basically where we're evaluating what's out there and it will cover all our needs.\nSCOTT\n18:08 \nYeah. Well, I mean bringing that into one place too. And again, I think the conversation with precipio, like when you pick your next vendor, you may just want to know like do they have the capability of getting us to a place where we can consolidate even if we're just switching for the immediate use case now? So yeah, I think that's definitely a possibility. Are you like 100 percent like, you know, we need to move away from blearnapon, like we're going to pick a new vendor or is this sort of like we wanna see what's out there? You know, if it makes sense for us will, but, you know, there's also a scenario here where we do just stay with Learnupon.\nFERNANDO\n18:43 \nSo right now, we're looking at the market to see first of all, are there anything else better that is gonna cover some of our needs and have kind of, you know, by faces? So this year we'll do the LMS, you know, in two years once the country per expires, then the possibility to get, you know, everything to one system. But no, there's not, you know, there's we've been working with Learnupon. It, we know it works so we can extend for another year and it all depends on the times because we are limited in the thing has to be approved and accepted by may start working on everything to have ran by may again and June, at least have something to present to the head trainer so they can start using it and getting familiar with it and be ready to go by end of July. I would.\nSCOTT\n19:42 \nYeah, that makes sense.\nFERNANDO\n19:44 \nDo have time frame so we can carry over Learnupon because we have make it work and most of the people are used to. But yeah, if, yeah, there's no, no pressure. We're not gonna put, you know, the priority is basically to have something available for them. So.\nSCOTT\n20:06 \nAre they the one pushing you for valuing new platform or is this something you're just kind of deciding that it makes sense for us to review?\nFERNANDO\n20:14 \nNo, it's not then that they're all, I guess happy with Learnupon. This is more as or looking to see what, what's out there. And also for a cost efficiency, if we can merge everything into one system will make more sense. But again, you know, we have to look into for sure. There's always the fact to put in all your eggs in the same basket. But for us, I don't think it will be an issue there.\nSCOTT\n20:45 \nYeah. Well, I mean, consolidation usually just makes a ton of sense, right? Pay for two platforms, pay for one. You're probably definitely going to be saving. I do know Learnupon place in the space, and it sounds like we bid on your feedback in 2020. We do see them more in like the first time LMS buyer space where Docebo is doing more of like, you know, hey, we've outgrown it.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n21:06 \nWe've out scaled this LMS, we kinda need what's next, but like how many folks are kind a part of that training like that are going through like that? Your onboarding each year re trading like what's the total number of employees that are kind of part of that?\nFERNANDO\n21:21 \nAt this moment, we had about 890 employees.\nSCOTT\n21:25 \nOkay.\nFERNANDO\n21:26 \nJust… because we need to keep certain employees, the records of the training on certain employees are no longer at for at least two years. So, so right now, I was looking at Learnupon, so, yeah, about 900 employees… and about 500 more that are inactive, but we keep them there two years. So something that we kind of figure out our way just create folders, you know, and we archived them very per season. So, I think I have some people from 2020 now that I can raise this here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Fernando is currently assessing the market to see if there are better options than Learnupon, which they are currently using. \n• The evaluation is being conducted with an eye toward consolidating their current software and finding a more cost-efficient solution.\n• There are 890 active employees, and 500 employees who have been inactive for two years and archived for record-keeping purposes.  END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n22:06 \nSo…\nFERNANDO\n22:06 \nWe're gonna reduce it there. So, yeah, but in, yeah, in a busy winter, we say about 809 100 employees will be in the system.\nSCOTT\n22:20 \nOkay. Because I think one thing we'll have to figure out for you is like obviously we've got like, you know, peaks and valleys in your users, right? So you got like a high spike there normally like I would suggest like just putting you on our 1,000 monthly active tier, but we'd probably have to do some price adjustments just given that, you know, most folks are going to be coming in those three three months and you may still do things like we can do like those same things you mentioned like the bulletins we've got like an informal module, like if you want to send invites out to say, hey here's, your like weekly update or news or things we're sharing. You can definitely use our platform for that too, but it is an additional module. So normally say you're probably in the range of like I don't know with adjustments maybe like 30 Ish K per year. So I want to say, you know, is that sort of like within the expectations and obviously this could vary there's things like our onboarding and optional modules you could pick from.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n23:18 \nBut just kind of looking at like where we could be that's probably the range. And again, obviously, there's benefits to consolidation and bringing in precipio that wouldn't necessarily add a lot here down the road. But just knowing that Learnupon is a little bit more low cost like just how that compares that you're kinda open into those. So that conversation.\nIntegrations\nFERNANDO\n23:37 \nAnd would that cost include the content library or is that a different package?\nSCOTT\n23:43 \nYeah. So the content is a different subscription. So that would be more so just like the core platform and like your onboarding content, I'd say typically it almost doubles the project. But like you're probably looking at, you know, depending on how much content, it could be like another 20 to 25 to 30 K depending on how much content you need.\nIntegrations ends\nSCOTT\n24:08 \nThe content is going to be the bigger piece for you. But obviously like that could be like if you're using crisipio for two years, like that is more of a conversation you're having in, you know, a year and a half as your potentially in that off… but I just wanna make sure there's no red flags like I mean, I would love to take it to introduce your team. I'd love to walk you through a demo, see if there is going to be a good fit here. And the logical kind of move up from Learnupon, but I do like to be transparent about price too if you're thinking about kind of like how do we be budget conscious here?\nFERNANDO\n24:40 \nYeah. Yeah. We can look into for sure. It is an increase but again, if we can at least get the practical training platform in it… we might be able to be… around the range. If not, then, yes, it will be more expensive and I won't think well.\nSCOTT\n25:05 \nAnd again, you may have some adjustments. Like again, I'm just ballparking like, you know, your time and use and year and like what we could do. But again, I just wanna make sure you've got a rough idea of, yeah, but in terms of next steps, I mean, again, I think I would love to kind of introduce to chat you. I'm not sure if you probably got a demo from us three years ago, but many things have changed too. What does your evaluation kind of process look?\nFERNANDO\n25:30 \nI think we just got scared with the price at the beginning. So we just didn't you guys… with the demo and everything. I don't think we did have. I can't recall that was, yeah.\nSCOTT\n25:43 \nYou probably looked at so many. They tend to blend together a little bit, but.\nFERNANDO\n25:51 \nGoing back to the other tool. So do you have something within the seo that has it or do we need to acquire still this other platform to work our content?\nSCOTT\n26:04 \nSo you can, we can build content right within Docebo. I mean, we've got testing quizzing surveys, your powerpoints. We do have a unique product called Shape that basically it'll like turn like a powerpoint or PDF into more like a short video that's a little bit more engaging, but you can also pair with.\nFERNANDO\n26:22 \nShape.\nSCOTT\n26:24 \nShape is an extra cost. And again, we could always show you to kind of like see like what that looks like, but really conceptually it's like, you know, you could upload a four page powerpoint or PDF. It'll turn it into like a two minute video. You can add some like a little bit of like, you know, questions, answers, maybe your own video, but it just makes it kind of easier than just like reading through a longer document.\nFERNANDO\n26:46 \nDoes it have the voice over as well? You know, to transfer text to a voice?\nSCOTT\n26:51 \nYeah, you can do voice overs and there's also like languages as well. So you can actually translate your content to different languages. So that could be an advantage to I'm not sure if you guys are global or are mostly us and Canada, but.\nFERNANDO\n27:04 \nYeah, I know we've got a station in the U. S. Is all also English. So, yeah, no English and French.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott suggested to use the 1,000 monthly active tier with pricing adjustments due to peak and valley user experiences. \n• Inclusion of onboarding, optional modules, and content library require additional costs with a range of $30K - $60K per year. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n27:09 \nYeah. So, yeah, there's a ton of kind of smaller things to explore and this is where going through a demo, we kinda map out like what's going to be the best fit for you?\nPricing\nFERNANDO\n27:20 \nHow much will be Shape?\nSCOTT\n27:23 \nSo, Shape is normally 7,500 per year. We've got a couple of different user models whether it's how many people are viewing it or how many people are like actual creators and.\nFERNANDO\n27:34 \n750 per creator.\nSCOTT\n27:38 \nNo, it's like 775 100 for the year. And that gets you up to like three creator licenses. So it's like…\nFERNANDO\n27:46 \n500, so 7,000 per 100.\nSCOTT\n27:48 \nYeah. And again, these adjustments we could do based off like your usage there, but again, it is an option, but you can also pair is with Ispring like if you guys love ice bring, we can test that out. Like, I don't know what you pay for them.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n28:02 \nI know they're fairly low cost. So, pretty much the three options. Are there built in our tool, built in Shape, built in external tool. You could do all three.\nFERNANDO\n28:11 \nAnd the tool that you have in industry, it… how is it for the exam and quest? Like compare with Shape? I guess is a limited.\nSCOTT\n28:25 \nNo, I mean you get tons of options there. Like if you're thinking just of exams like testing capabilities, I mean you can attach like your videos, your pictures and may not have like I think you mentioned Ispring like answering a question with four pictures. Like, I don't know that I have that specific functionality, but you can have like a picture listed and like a question that's like, hey, like what's happening here? What's the procedure? So there's a bunch of different question types. We do have a question bank too. So, I know you kinda mentioned like you have to get somebody up to a certain proficiency, but if you want to do like, hey, every single time, ask them 10 questions from these 25, like it could recycle each time too depending on what you're looking to, you know, validate or certify them on. So there is a bunch of testing functionality that's native to the platform.\nFERNANDO\n29:14 \nIt… makes sense.\nSCOTT\n29:20 \nSo, I think just in terms of next steps, like again, it feels like there could be a good fit here if you're open to it. I mean, I would definitely love to book time and introduce to your team. Ultimately, we're all about being a good fit, right? So if we meet together and we're like, hey, this makes sense. Let's keep our conversations going. Great. If you're like, you know what? This doesn't make sense? Like we're we might go down another path or stay with Learnupon, that's okay too. I mean, I'd love to just kinda like introduce it to your team. I.\nFERNANDO\n29:47 \nYeah, I think we can take a look and see what especially when I say, you know, the capabilities that we have for creating the exams and, you know, the, that, that's a feature that we definitely need to improve and also the practical training side. So if we can, if we can fulfill all test those features, I think the LMS overall… I think they all do the same. So, you know, the ILT, the content upload, and all that. I think the reporting as well is really important for us. But pretty much all the LMS have that. So I think at this moment, yeah, ideally for us is to get those at least those two features improving in our system.\nSCOTT\n30:36 \nYeah, for sure. And I think, you know, seeing is believing too. I'd say, you know, from a high level, all of us are the same but like we have a few differences, like we try to be high engagement, we try to like help build learning culture and not just be like a mandatory training type of field. So we do some stuff that's a little bit different too. But who else cares about this project? Like who should we bring in for kind of like a first demo?\nFERNANDO\n30:59 \nI'll probably bring some of my team on the training side.\nSCOTT\n31:04 \nOkay.\nFERNANDO\n31:06 \nWe got one in Vancouver. We got one in Boston… and tomorrow Montreal would say.\nSCOTT\n31:15 \nAre these your field trainers?\nFERNANDO\n31:18 \nNo, no, this is mainly for my coordinator. So basically… yeah, we provide support to all the head trainer. So head trainers don't have much of a saying which, you know, they can suggest and they know that by the end of the day is a corporate decision that to go with which type of LMS. But yeah, we'll we can share some of the guys to get their feedback.\nNext Steps\nSCOTT\n31:45 \nYeah, and we can always do afterwards like some videos as well and share that way. But when it makes sense, obviously, we've got a little bit of a time range timeframe here for decision probably and like if you are gonna make a switch the next month and a half, probably, you know, because contracting can take time and that type of stuff too. Making sure you have the window for the transition. Is that something we want to try to book for like next week or how's your schedule over the next little bit?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott outlined that Shape is normally 7,500 per year for up to three creator licenses. \n• Next steps involve scheduling a demo for Fernando's team-- including field trainers and coordinators-- to get feedback on the capabilities of Shape. \n• A time frame of roughly a month and a half is needed for transition into the new platform.

I was staying with my parents like last year and there was a Power outage. Yup.

Yeah, just really think of me, Tom is your main point of contact here is you're you know, going through your evaluation, whether that's you know, immediately down the road, it's really the goal of today is to kinda understand sort of, you know, learn a little bit more about your project, if you have an ongoing project and see if Docebo is really a good fit for what you're looking to do.

Is there anything that you're kinda hoping to get out of today's? Call or anything that we can kinda kick things off with?\nPHILADELPHIA\n2:52 \nBob, I'm more than willing to answer any questions you've got and I think that will help us figure out whether or not we're going down the right road together, what we, what my needs are, and what your capabilities are. So shoot.\nNICK\n3:05 \nLove it. Well, I always like to, you know, obviously Milton scheduled this call and is very convincing to get folks on the line. But I always like to understand sort of like what spark the initial interest on your end to even meet with us just to get a sense of where you're at.\nPHILADELPHIA\n3:21 \nWe are in our fiftieth year of operations. We're a nonprofit area agency on aging and we have always done training the old fashioned way. We've been paper and pencil since forever. We've just recently begun to, you know, work with an online registration site and, you know, we had face to face training was our only method of delivery up until the pandemic made us choose otherwise. And so we've done a little bit of the virtual training, but we've never had an LMS. So we've never had the ability to capture all of the data around who's taking what. We've never had the ability to really say, okay, if you're in this job position, these are the trainings you need to take. We don't have any of that, Nick. We're definitely ledgeling. So my, I guess my boss asked me to go and see what's out there. I thanks.\nNICK\n4:18 \nNo, that's awesome to, and of course, yeah, based on that on a high level, for sure, we're talking to the right or you're talking to the right people. So that's good. And it sounds like there is an active project based on what you're saying based on the bus kinda saying let's modernize this. Let's get things going I guess from a, and that's great. I mean, that's I mean, we, we've seen a lot of it's pretty common, right? That the pandemic has pushed a lot of organizations like yourself that have been traditionally face to face, push them into a more virtual setting and understand that it's probably not going anywhere, right?

{"prompt":"NICK\n5:00 \nSo that's great. And I guess, you know, from a needs requirements standpoint, have you had a chance to sort of, and I guess Tom, I should know your experience coming into this. Have you, I know the organizations newer to the MS, have you had experience with an LMS before? Awesome. So first time for everything I was saying?\nPHILADELPHIA\n5:20 \nYeah.\nNICK\n5:22 \nSo from a needs requirements standpoint, have you kind of figured out, you know, what's important to your project? I know you mentioned like job positions, capturing data, right? Like that's the core functionality. Is there anything specific to what you're looking to accomplish?\nPHILADELPHIA\n5:37 \nWe have, we have certain groups of staff that have annual training requirements. So one of the things that I'm looking to do is to be able to meet those needs and do it in a process. Now, I'm a party of one. So I don't have this huge staff of people who can do record keeping and stuff behind me. So I'm looking for something that will, you know, we can put out and say these are the required trainings that you have on an annual basis that will shoot them reminders as their time comes up to the, you know, the year round thing, put the training out there for them.\nIntegrations\nPHILADELPHIA\n6:10 \nI know that we would like to find an LMS that has certain embedded training in it, a library of sorts of things that we could, you know, use right away and not have to build ourselves. We would be building things on our own, of course, that would be specific to our agency. And that would need to be an interface that would be pretty easy for again party of one here to put together.\nNICK\n6:35 \nYeah, absolutely. No. I'm just taking some notes here. This is all interesting. So sounds like the core is really that annual training compliance type training. I'm guessing is what you're looking for out of the, when we think of, you know, content that you don't wanna be building. It's likely around that. But I would like to know, you know, when you mentioned content having embedded training, we certainly have what's called the table content. We do have a integrated content library. It's an aggregate of roughly 200 different providers. So you have a lot of different formats, a lot of different flexibility when it comes to the types of training that you can offer your learners.\nIntegrations ends\nNICK\n7:16 \nSo we got you covered there, but we'd love to know sort of what type of training you're looking to have kind of out of the box. And then we'll talk maybe a little bit more about that more in house training that you're looking to build. So, can you give me a sense beyond compliance? Is there anything else that you're looking for? And it might be compliance?\nPHILADELPHIA\n7:33 \nWell, yes, compliance. Certainly one of them and one of the ones that we want to track. We'd also like to have a stable of leadership development programs that would be available. Some personal and Professional development programs for folks that, you know, they can get on and, you know, take when they can. One of the difficult things we struggle with is getting people to commit to three or four hours of time during the day to go to a training program. Whereas if there was a training, a topic that they can go to online, spend a half an hour on mark their place, go away, come back, do it again.\nSmall Talk\nPHILADELPHIA\n8:08 \nYou know, that would be helpful in terms of just getting it to fit into the new reality that we're working with because we're not in the office, all of us at the same time. I'm working from my home office today. I would say we have a hybrid if you will environment right now, some of our staff don't come in the office more than once or twice a month, but they do go out into the field from their home and do home visits and assessments and things like that.\nSmall Talk ends\nPHILADELPHIA\n8:32 \nSo those are some of the things that I would look to do in terms of designing ourselves, our onboarding training. We have a group of specific topics that all new hires get, and then some other ones that special groups of new hires get, these are all delivered in person or virtually right now, you know, but live.\nIntegrations\nPHILADELPHIA\n8:54 \nSo we're looking to at least have some kind of backup on that. Those would be the ones that we would develop ourselves and then upload.\nNICK\n9:03 \nGotcha. Awesome. No, hey from off the shelf like we got you covered there. And no problem. I think you'd be very impressed with the scope of the topics that we can support you on… your own content. That's that makes sense, right? We see that, I mean anywhere some organizations upwards of like 80 percent of their content is… essentially what's the, where I'm looking for. I mean, it's coming from a source that is prebuilt, right? So when you think of your content, do you have content?\nIntegrations ends\nNICK\n9:35 \nAnd I kinda understand the different formats in which you want to deliver your training too? Because I know you're primarily have hasn't been face to face. So, I guess kind of a two two part question first being, do you have content that you've built out that would be ready to be plugged into an LMS? Or you can, do you have a plan to sort of build that out when it comes to onboarding, for example?\nPHILADELPHIA\n9:57 \nI would say not built already. I mean, we have general powerpoint presentations that are delivered either virtually on Zoom or in person by specific trainers. So we would probably want to be able to capture that in a sense and have that uploaded so that we still employ our trainers to do that training. But three months down the road, you know, Mary Jones needs a refresher on documentation because she forgot all the stuff she was supposed to do rather than try and put her back together. Again with a live trainer, we've got that and we can send that out to her or send her to that location and pull it up herself.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nick and Philadelphia discussed their need for an LMS to support annual training requirements.\n• Philadelphia is looking for embedded training, a library of resources, and easy-to-use interface for content building.\n• Nick mentioned that the MS has a content library with 200 providers of different formats and flexibilities of training.\n• Philadelphia is also looking to have leadership development programs, personal/professional development programs, and onboarding trainings available online.\n• They discussed capturing existing powerpoint presentations for refreshers down the road. END"}
{"prompt":"NICK\n10:38 \nPerfect. Love it. Yeah, we see that often, right? That initial training might take face to face, but having those recordings be available so you can even, I mean if someone miss something or you want to refresh or it just gives you that more, this is sorta like on demand or like self service type of training you can do.\nCourse Enrollment\nNICK\n10:58 \nSo no problem there. We have an integration with Zoom as well. Should note. So out of the box, you'll be able to create those sessions which is great because it does a few things. It allows you to keep everything in the LMS. So your learners know like this is where training happens, right? It allows your instructors to have more of a, you know, more organization on their end, whether it's like a recurring thing that's happened monthly, whatever it may be. And of course, it's gonna track attendance. It allows you to also attach sort of content to it as well. So let's say if there's like you want to get some surveys, some feedback around that initial onboarding session, you can have that built into the class.\nLearning Plans\nNICK\n11:37 \nSo you can start gathering some of that data that you can then make adjustments with. So that's just some things that we hear from a, from an ILT standpoint virtual ILT standpoint face to face. And then again, you can take that information or that content and build it into learning paths that are more guided towards those different job titles.\nLearning Plans ends\nNICK\n11:58 \nSo it sounds like from a content perspective, like you have content, it's just trying to get it maybe into a format that can be uploaded into the LMS might be that initial?\nPHILADELPHIA\n12:09 \nYeah. I would say that our content is pretty much, you know, synchronus right now and we need something that would go a synchroni when it was necessary.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n12:18 \nYeah, absolutely.\nPHILADELPHIA\n12:19 \nRight now we have our HRIS system is Paylocity, yeah. So, I'm curious as to what kind of an interface would need to be built to work with that, and what the process is like, cost is like et cetera.\nNICK\n12:36 \nYeah. So you're talking integration, right? Like you wanna get a sense, so just to summarize paylosity or the HRS, that is your source of truth when it comes to employees information.\nIntegrations ends\nNICK\n12:47 \nI'm guessing. Awesome. So we always like to understand like exactly that. Like if we're going to create users, get their information, job title, all that information, where is that coming from? So it sounds like pilots to a, so there's a few different options when it comes to integration and I always say yes, like 100 percent we can figure it out.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n13:07 \nWe got you covered. It's more so, and we want to have a more probably technical conversation on this. But just for today, we have what's called an Automation app. So at the very base level out of the box, what it does is it grabs a CSV file from an FTP folder.\nBranches & Groups\nNICK\n13:23 \nSo paylosiy would export your information of employee information. We would grab that and create users based on that information. I, going one step further, what's nice about Docebo there's a lot of Automation built in. So it's gonna allow you to, as a party of one, not have to go in and assign users to specific courses. It's gonna know, okay, Milton is a brand new employee. He's just joined on. He needs to take xyz training. He falls into this group. So we can personalize a lot of that and automate a lot of that for you. So it's somewhat set it and forget it. So that's the first thing, right?\nIntegrations\nNICK\n14:00 \nAnd that's just getting pushed from palocity, that's out of the box comes included with the platform. There's no additional fees there. If that's not sufficient, we have open APIs and we have a product called Docebo connect which taps into it's, like a MIddleware that kinda taps into the as understanding palocity likely also has open APIs. We have a lot of customers using it today. So all of this to say is that we got you covered. We just always wanna know essentially like what is your desired workflow, desired outcome from an integration standpoint? And we can make the best recommendation based on that. So I would typically bring a solutions architect in for that call and you might wanna bring someone more if you're the guy.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n14:44 \nSure. But sometimes folks brings in like an it someone from the it department. So we will typically as we're doing somewhat, you know, if you decided to go move forward with the down the road, we would do some sort of it validation where we make sure that when we get into onboarding? We know exactly what we're doing from a user provisioning standpoint?\nIntegrations\nPHILADELPHIA\n15:07 \nOkay.\nNICK\n15:08 \nAnswer that helpfully or? Yeah.\nPHILADELPHIA\n15:11 \nThat's fine. Awesome.\nNICK\n15:13 \nAny other integrations while we're on the topic? I understand paylosity is going to be the source of truth, but is there anything else you can think of from an integration standpoint?\nPHILADELPHIA\n15:21 \nNo, I don't think so.\nNICK\n15:23 \nThat's the most important one.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Learning plans were discussed, allowing learners an organized space to guide their learning.\n• Integrations with Palocity as the source of truth for user information and attendance tracking was discussed, as well as automated user provisioning and content personalization without additional fees. \n• Onboarding assistance to ensure successful integrations was discussed, as well as checking for any other integrations. END"}
{"prompt":"NICK\n15:24 \nNo worries. Awesome. So kinda have talk a little, but the content that's great… from a learner perspective you mentioned, I should, I always like to understand who they are, understanding that they're internal employees to the Philadelphia corporation for a PC a and go by guess. Yeah. So PC a internal employees, is there anything unique about them? When I say that you mentioned like your hybrid, they're in the field, there's different job roles, different titles, because what we see is that, you know, it sounds like they're mostly internal to the organization, right? Their employees. Is there anyone external that's not an employee that you're looking to provide training for?\nPHILADELPHIA\n16:06 \nNot at this point. I mean, there might be somewhere down the road, but no, let's focus on pca for now.\nNICK\n16:11 \nAwesome. Perfect. So within PC a, is there anything you know, unique about those like, and again, things that you've already described such as like some of them are more field workers, some of them are maybe more on the corporate internal side.\nBranches & Groups\nNICK\n16:25 \nLike is there anything that we should know that differentiates some of those and perhaps any personalization or to that job role that you'd wanna see?\nPHILADELPHIA\n16:34 \nWould say the differentiation would be by department. So, you know, within departments, there are probably five or six different job titles that would probably be a differentiator for calling training to one place or the other. So it'll be at the department level mostly.\nNICK\n16:51 \nAwesome. That's perfect. And what we would do is we're going to mirror your hierarchy like through that integration with palocity. So as folks move through those departments and those different job titles, what was reflected in the LMS is Automatic. So a lot of onboarding is gonna be… dedicated to kind of building out those pathways.\nPayment Gateway\nNICK\n17:12 \nSo that's great. That's simple that's straightforward. It's nothing like crazy. We have a lot of just so you know, like a lot of our customers and partners will use the platform to train external audiences. So if you ever get to that point, we can handle that as well.\nCourse Enrollment\nNICK\n17:28 \nBut it's not within the scope for today's, conversation. So that's okay. And understanding no LMS today, everything's paper and plan, but we're using Zoom. It sounds like for face to face, are you doing face to face like live training as well? Like not virtual? Yep. Okay. So just so it sounds like E learning virtual and face to face.\nMobile App\nNICK\n17:50 \nThose are the really the formats that you need to be able to support from. Awesome. Is there any mobile like does mobile come into the equation? Users out in the field? Perhaps wanting to be able to use like a phone or an iPad or something like that? Is that important or is it mostly done on the computer?\nMobile App ends\nPHILADELPHIA\n18:08 \nNo, I would say probably not Nick, you know, be one is nice to have, but I don't think we need to have it at this point in time. I don't want anybody taking training from their iPhone while they're driving to a point.\nNICK\n18:20 \nYeah, that's…\nPHILADELPHIA\n18:22 \nAlso head of the safety and security committee. So, you know, that's probably not something good I want to recommend.\nNICK\n18:28 \nSounds like a liability, no doubt. Awesome. Cool. Well, hey, I just so you know, like we and this isn't you know, every LMS is going to handle this differently, but we definitely can support you from, you know, having that more on demand learning virtual and ILT, so that's great.\nCoach & Share\nNICK\n18:47 \nAnd in terms of, you know, when we think of the LMS, it's often a top down approach, right? Folks come in, they need to take that annual training. Perhaps there's some refreshers that they wanna do. But what we find is that we're looking to create more of a culture of learning amongst our are learners having something that's a little more social a little more in like informal where they can come ask questions, perhaps share some content. Some things that they see record their screen, tap in to subject matter experts across the organization. We see that it's more of a social learning aspect of your LMS. More peer to peer is something like that within sort of your vision for your training? Or are you looking for something that's a little bit more? Just top down folks come in and take training and they get out just kinda.\nCoach & Share ends\nPHILADELPHIA\n19:39 \nThat could be something down the road. I mean, that we have folks now who have no experience with an LMS at all. So I don't want them to get too confused on what we're trying to do. I think just top down at this point in time and knowing that there's an option leader on if we want to go to that route is nice, but it's definitely not something I need right now.\nNICK\n19:58 \nNot part of that phase one as.\nPHILADELPHIA\n20:00 \nNo, sir.\nNICK\n20:01 \nCool. Then. No, that's good. It's always just helpful to kinda get a sense of where you're at today because we always like to meet you where you're at, give you some ideas for the future, right? You don't want to grow your learning vendor. If you can't avoid it. Cool. Well, last, you know, kind of like more of the required questions. I always got to ask like from a timeline perspective, like are you trying to, do you have like a date in mind where you're trying to have users live in the platform. And is there anything that's sorta driving this forward?\nPHILADELPHIA\n20:36 \nNo, not at this time. Again, it's a, we gotta do something about this time. Go figure it out thing. Tom is trying to figure it out at this point.\nNICK\n20:47 \nOkay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Philadelphia Corporation's PCA has internal employees in various job roles with five to six different job titles within each department.\n• The scope of the training covers virtual and face-to-face sessions, but does not require mobile app for now.\n• The organization is looking for a top down approach and can explore peer to peer/social learning in the future as per requirements.\n• There is no timeline or date set yet for users to be live in the platform. END"}
{"prompt":"PHILADELPHIA\n20:48 \nI mean, I'm not going to be able to sit here a year from now and say, yeah, we're still looking, boss. I'm going to have some recommendations, you know, let's say six months down the road. I should be able to say, okay, this is what I think we ought to be doing here.\nNICK\n21:00 \nOkay. So kind of making a decision within the six month time frame is, or what you're in?\nOnboarding\nPHILADELPHIA\n21:04 \nAnd…\nNICK\n21:06 \nHopefully, hopefully getting this thing launched within 2023 would be the goal.\nPHILADELPHIA\n21:11 \nI think that would be appropriate, yeah.\nNICK\n21:13 \nOkay.\nPHILADELPHIA\n21:14 \nPreferably before my next evaluation.\nNICK\n21:17 \nOkay. No, that's good. We can make it look good that's for sure.\nPHILADELPHIA\n21:22 \nI don't…\nNICK\n21:23 \nAnd then, no, that just helps. And sometimes it's like just understanding, is there anything like urgent that's like pressing that needs to be addressed?\nOnboarding ends\nNICK\n21:32 \nSeems like there's not, seems like it's more like this is a modernization of your training, which is great. That's super exciting. I always like to get pricing out there like understanding budget early on because I wanna make sure we're a good fit. The last thing I wanna do is get like six months down the road and you're like we're not aligned from a budget perspective before I even introduce our pricing. I think that like do you have a defined budget for this project or are you sorta seeing what's in the marketplace and building it based on?\nPHILADELPHIA\n22:03 \nYep, we are just looking at it and, you know, it will be part of the matrix of what I present at some point in time. But right now, no one said don't spend more than they have no clue what it costs.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n22:18 \nThat's fair. And what you'll see to there's a lot of variants if you will. Within the LMS marketplace, you're gonna have some pretty straight simple type LMS that are very cost effective or affordable low cost providers, right? We're definitely not a low cost provider. We are certainly going to be more of a robust LMS. But having said that we're not the most expensive in the marketplace either. So it really depends on what you're trying, what product you're trying to bring in solution you're trying to bring to your learners. Having said that as well that's the LMS, the content side of things content arguing costs just as much if not more than your LMS. Typically, when you're in the marketplace, I don't know if you've kind of evaluated that not every LMS vendor is gonna have an integrated content library. Some of them might have suggest a third party where they bring it in. Ours is fully integrated. So it makes your life and your learners life a lot easier.\nPricing\nNICK\n23:17 \nSo to give you some pricing which I'm happy to do. I'd love to explain sort of our pricing model and then get a sense of the scope of your project. So we use a monthly active user model. So what that means is that a user is active if they come in, consume a piece of content and I can share this in a follow up email just so I see, right? And just, you know, I'm not gonna test.\nPHILADELPHIA\n23:40 \nNot taking here.\nNICK\n23:41 \nJust because this one sometimes helps to have it writing because you're gonna see different pricing models. So for us, with the monthly active user model, the easiest way to describe it's like cell phone on your data plan. Every month, you got a certain amount of data, you can use it. If you go over there's, a small overage fee, but at the end of the month, it just resets itself and you get a fresh amount of data. So for us, we want to understand the best tier for you to be in. So for example, our entry level tier was gonna get you up to 300 active users per month. So every month you got 300 users that can come into the platform, take content. And at the amount of resets, it can be the same users, new users. It does not matter. It just resets.\nPHILADELPHIA\n24:27 \nOkay. Doesn't matter on who it is. The number is 300.\nNICK\n24:31 \nAnd we're just using that as an example as a starting point and I should note it is an annual subscription. So the pricing I give you is based off a three year term and we do have a one time onboarding fee in the first year. So having said all that would love to understand sort of the scope. I mean, do you have any idea roughly in on average per month what you'd be sorta seeing live in the platform?\nPHILADELPHIA\n24:58 \nI'd be shocked if we ever went over 300. Okay. So I think realistic, we, we've got about 425 people right now on staff of that 425. Realistically, they're not all going to be users of the training platform. They don't want use training.\nPricing ends\nPHILADELPHIA\n25:16 \nNow, basically, we've got a group of people who are in our meal distribution center that are pretty just hands on workers. So, I'm thinking that if we got a tier of 300, I would love to go over.\nNICK\n25:28 \nFor sure.\nPHILADELPHIA\n25:30 \nRealistically based on usage from our current training processes, I don't think that we hit more than that.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n25:37 \nAwesome. So, so it sounds like that entry level would be a great place to start. It would provide. Awesome. So to give you an idea from a pricing perspective you'd be looking at and I'll break it down. You got the LMS and I'll break down because the content is an additional product. The LMS, you're looking at around 20,000 dollars per year just for the LMS. And the content really depends on the different. We have three different buckets. If you will, of course, you're going to have access to the entire library. We have close to 80,000 courses. You will have a white glove service, someone to help you pick those courses. So they'll be like my gosh there's we actually wanna make sure, you know, yeah, it's a partnership but you're looking at anywhere, you know, we have 50 courses, 150 courses or access to the entire library. So again, regardless of which bucket you're in, you have access to the library, it's just how many of those can you actually enroll users into?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Philadelphia is aiming to onboard new staff within the next 6 months and launch the project in 2023.\n• Nick suggests understanding budget early on as to ensure a good fit and that there are no urgent pressing matters that need addressing.\n• Nick outlines pricing model and provides an entry-level tier of 300 active users per month with an annual subscription.\n• Nick breaks down costs for LMS at $20,000 per year and content varying between 50, 150, or access to the entire library with white glove service. END"}
{"prompt":"NICK\n26:37 \nSo at 50, you're looking at around 20,000 at the 150, you're looking at around 33,000. And at the unlimited you're looking at around 43,000. So it really just depends on where you're at and that's so that's the LMS plus the content. Based on our initial conversations, I don't foresee there being any of their additional costs at this point, but I always like to put a little caveat there's other things that we uncover as we continue, there might be additional things but, you know, based on what we know, integrations and things of that nature that's pretty much it, there's no hidden fees.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n27:14 \nNow, the onboarding given the fact that you're sort of like a single use case, it's very straightforward. We have an eight week onboarding. It's about it's. 5,500 and you'll have a solutions deployment manager with you for the duration of those eight weeks to help train you. We use a train the trainer approach and show you where to click. But you're going to do all the configuration. We wanna make sure we teach you to fish and not give you a fish because then you…\nPHILADELPHIA\n27:40 \nYou…\nNICK\n27:41 \nKnow what to do.\nPHILADELPHIA\n27:42 \nSo.\nNICK\n27:45 \nI'll pause there. I just would love to know.\nOnboarding ends\nNICK\n27:47 \nI mean kinda, is that in line with sort of what you've been seeing, what you're looking at, is there any questions around any of that?\nPHILADELPHIA\n27:54 \nI haven't seen a whole lot but it is definitely in line with what we're looking at absolutely.\nNICK\n28:00 \nAwesome.\nPHILADELPHIA\n28:01 \nI don't know how the numbers compare to anybody, but.\nNICK\n28:04 \nThat's what you're doing now.\nPHILADELPHIA\n28:06 \nYeah. You know, nothing you said here today has scared me away.\nNICK\n28:10 \nYeah. You haven't left the call yet. So that's at no that's all good. Again, pricing is out there. I like to put it to the side. Now, let's focus on your needs and solving those challenges. So, the last question I will ask you mentioned your boss, like who else is interested in this project? Like who else would be involved in this type of decision making?\nPHILADELPHIA\n28:30 \nAt some point in time, my boss is going to be involved in it.\nNICK\n28:34 \nAnd just out of curiosity, your boss, what's their role? What are they look? They're interested?\nPHILADELPHIA\n28:39 \nShe is the new executive administrator of human resources. She has been on board for three weeks now. So I'm still in the process of training her.\nNICK\n28:55 \nThat answers a lot of questions of conversation. Now, it's like, well, we got a new boss and the boss has some priorities and things that they want to get done. So, so no worries there. Anyone else that you can think of that might be, have any interest? Just always like to know any other stakeholders that might be involved.\nPHILADELPHIA\n29:14 \nI can't think of any off hand Nick. I'm sure somebody else will wanted to chimein at some point in time prior to my new boss coming on board, I've been working pretty closely with our president and CEO. So I'm sure… he'll want to hear about it at some point in time as well.\nNext Steps\nNICK\n29:31 \nFor sure. Yeah, that's no problem. Usually down the road. We see them kinda come in the ninth in the eleventh hour just to sorta give the.\nPHILADELPHIA\n29:40 \nYeah. I'm sure that at some point in time, once I get down to a recommendation or two, somebody else is gonna want to sit through a presentation. Okay? I see what you're saying now. Yeah.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n29:50 \nYeah, we're happy to, we see multiple demos happening so that my last question would be, as, for next steps for you to like, we've kinda talked about some pricing. We've given you some ideas and we've talked a little bit about your timeline, understanding that you're about, you know, kind O, six months, like where are you at right now with sort of next steps for your evaluation?\nOnboarding ends\nPHILADELPHIA\n30:12 \nI would like to get as much in writing as I can from you. I would like to see some sort of if I can see your process in action anywhere. If you can give me a, you know, something to look at, that would be good, you know, see how this works. It sounds good. But let's look under the hood a little bit and see what that whole process is like.\nNICK\n30:34 \nSo what we can do kinda two two options given your timeline is nothing like this like, hey, we got to have this picked in the next month. I've got some demo recordings that I can share with you that give you a little sense of and I think they're great to have anyways because they're a great refresher. So I can send you all the info that we talked about pricing and some recordings of the demos. And from there, I work with a solutions consultant that once it makes sense for you, we can build out a custom demo and really walk you through that, have it be more interactive or I can offer that to you. Now, it's really up to you. I'm easy, what would work best for you? And kinda how you?\nWrap-Up\nPHILADELPHIA\n31:09 \nI would say option a, at this point?\nNICK\n31:12 \nAwesome. Okay. So option a, and what, the only thing I would ask for you, Tom, is that when I send you over these, I would love to schedule a follow up where you and I can kinda circle back. I can answer any questions on the resources and you're gonna see a lot over the next little bit like a lot of, you know, other LMS things like that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nick offered three plans (50, 150, and unlimited). \n• The onboarding process comprises of a 8-week training period using a train the trainer approach. \n• Nick inquired about any other stakeholders who might be involved in the decision making process and it was determined that the new executive administrator of human resources will eventually get involved.\n• The President and CEO could be involved eventually. \n \n END"}
{"prompt":"NICK\n31:29 \nHow much time would you think you would need to sort of digest the information that I send you and circle back and kinda talk about what next steps might look like from there?\nPHILADELPHIA\n31:42 \nI'm gazing at my calendar now or a calendar right now? No problem.\nPHILADELPHIA\n31:53 \nAnd I have a vacation stuck in the middle early in the first week of March. I'm thinking probably mid March. I should be able to Wade through it and get back in touch the week of the thirteenth.\nNICK\n32:05 \nWeek of the thirteenth? Perfect. Yeah, I'm hey, I'm away on vacation the week of the sixth too. So, so we won't be talking to each other then, which is great because it sounds like you're off so well, we'd be okay if we threw something tentatively in the calendar for the week of the thirteenth just to have a reconnect in there.\nPHILADELPHIA\n32:21 \nThat's probably the best way to do it Thursday or Fridays are best because if we catch a new hire cycle that I'm training in it's usually on a Tuesday or Wednesday, so.\nNICK\n32:34 \nNo problem. So, Thursday, I'm pretty flexible right now. I got what time did we meet today? We met at 10 30. Would that time work for you on?\nWrap-Up\nPHILADELPHIA\n32:43 \nYeah.\nNICK\n32:44 \nAwesome. That's a Tom and Nick reconnect in the calendar. I'm gonna send you some follow up information from today beyond the pricing, our pricing model, some demos. Is there any other resources that you think would be helpful at this point in time?\nPHILADELPHIA\n33:02 \nI don't know what, I don't know.\nWrap-Up ends\nNICK\n33:06 \nI don't wanna overwhelm you either. So I'll leave some meat on the bone but I'll think of some things if we have any sort of case studies that might be helpful. I can share those as well. So.\nPHILADELPHIA\n33:17 \nAnd again, if you've got here's, one, you know, I did mention early.\nAbout Docebo\nPHILADELPHIA\n33:20 \nWe are not for profit organization. We're a small organization. We're not huge. So, you know, I know that a lot of LMS is when you go out and take a look there for, you know, multinational agencies and all this stuff. We ain't that we're very small. We're very local, so that's the application I need.\nPricing\nNICK\n33:39 \nYep, that's works on. Just note that we can certainly look at non for profit pricing. So, the pricing I gave you consider that list pricing, but we got some flexibility built into there that we can talk about. I don't want to talk about it until you really, if you're like Nick, you're the preferred vendor?\nWrap-Up\nNICK\n33:54 \nLike what are we, what, what's the best he can do for a nonprofit, we can kind of chat from there.\nPHILADELPHIA\n34:00 \nThat makes sense.\nNICK\n34:01 \nElastic there though. I'll try and I'll make a note of that when I send it over to you. Awesome. I'll send you the reconnect. I look forward to it no less. I come off, I'll let you see.\nSmall Talk\nMILTON\n34:11 \nI…\nNICK\n34:12 \nAsk you a.\nMILTON\n34:14 \nWell, I've been laughing a lot so I…\nPHILADELPHIA\n34:18 \nWe're having a fun chat. Yes, we are Milton, thank you for your help getting Nick and I hooked up here and, you know, we'll see where we go from here.\nMILTON\n34:25 \nSounds good now. So, nice to meet you.\nWrap-Up\nPHILADELPHIA\n34:27 \nYou as well.\nMILTON\n34:28 \nRight.\nPHILADELPHIA\n34:29 \nAll right, gentlemen. Take care.

And… we can, like you said, we do have a recording of this.\nSmall Talk ends\nBENJAMIN\n1:28 \nSo anything that she misses, I'll send that over after this call just so she has access to everything. Really. The purpose of today's, call is to walk you through the platform. I know Jenna and I had a really good conversation around this being your first LMS, this being an initiative that we're really trying to launch. I know that there's some executive team that's really bought into the idea of learning and training, and we wanna talk to you today around what Docebo can do as a learning system and how we can also serve some of the content needs that you all might have as well.\nLayout & Content\nBENJAMIN\n1:55 \nSo we'll hit on, you know, the learner user profile, seeing what some of those experiences would look like. We'll pivot administratively and talk a little bit more about how you can actually action on some of this as well. So that's really the purpose of today's, call. But I wanted to introduce you to Matt because he is the man of the hour.\nLayout & Content ends\nBENJAMIN\n2:14 \nHe will be really leading most of the conversation during the demonstration. So I wanted him to have a chance to introduce himself. But also Matt kinda just turn it to you to kick things off in the platform as well.\nMATT\n2:25 \nSure. So I, Rana and gen, when you listen to this, my name is Matt.\nOnboarding\nMATT\n2:30 \nI'm a solution consultant here. So essentially like my role here's, to be your guide to the product. I answer the, does it do this? How does it do that kind of questions? And yeah, just essentially just here to be a resource for you.\nRANA\n2:42 \nAwesome. I'm really looking forward to it.\nOnboarding ends\nMATT\n2:47 \nWell, so well without further ado, then Rana, like we're not going to run you through like a 50 slide powerpoint or anything like that. We're just gonna hop right into the platform. Okay? Don't feel you need to be shy throughout this, ask questions, give us direction, let us know your thoughts, questions and concerns. Because if I talk for an hour and that's all that you listen to for the next little while, it's not a good call for anybody, so.\nRANA\n3:13 \nJennet and I myself are not shy at all.\nRANA\n3:15 \nIf we have.\nRANA\n3:16 \nAny questions or anything, we'll jump right in.\nMATT\n3:18 \nPerfect. All right. So yeah, feel free. Like don't feel you out to be on mute. Like there's no such thing as an interruption.\nRANA\n3:25 \nPerfect. Thank you.\nMATT\n3:27 \nAll right. We're gonna do a role based demo today. So we're gonna start by introducing you to the system from this perspective of your learners, right? This person's job is or their interaction with the platform is only to come here, find training, take training, that kind of thing. So just to give you an idea of like what does the end product of the, of it look like? But in a separate window, I've got the admin experience open over here. So this one would be more like along the lines of what does a day in the life of Rana and Jen look like? So it's a, it's you know, like how did we accomplish everything? And then it didn't really come up in the, in the last conversation, but I did wanna point out that we've and we probably won't spend a ton of time here.\nUser Permission\nMATT\n4:10 \nI just wanted to make you aware that there's a sub admin profile as well that we can do. So managers anyone who has a stake in the system or in the learning… of your employees that doesn't need full admin access to the system but still might have to use for data or content assignments or things like that.\nUser Permission ends\nMATT\n4:30 \nSo we'll make you aware that it's here, probably won't spend a ton of time on it though. Do those like just in terms of like the roles that you've seen the, does that kind of surmise like what you envisioned for? Like who would be interacting with the system or did we miss the mark? Is that Jen coming in right there?\nSmall Talk\nRANA\n4:49 \nHi, there, how?\nBENJAMIN\n4:50 \nAre you, how are you?\nRANA\n4:52 \nGood, good.\nBENJAMIN\n4:54 \nYou didn't miss hardly anything at all we enter.\nMATT\n4:56 \nYou missed the.\nBENJAMIN\n4:57 \nIntroduction to Matt and that's for, yeah, we're just hopping in now.\nMATT\n5:04 \nYeah, we're literally just about to sign into the in, into the platform and just we're just letting like Rana, no, there's no such thing as an interruption.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed the learner user experience and administrative action within the platform. \n• Matt mentioned that Jen has access to a sub admin profile, with certain levels of authority over data and content assignments. \n• They discussed roles for those interacting with the system. \n END"}

Now, just in terms of some orientation, just giving you an idea of what it is that you're looking at as we hop into the system. But you might notice that Ben and I spent some time on your website. But like we've borrowed a few things, okay, in terms of in terms of what you're looking at, we built this demo platform out to be very like functional and to showcase a lot of things in reality, it'll probably be a lot more simple than this. And Jen, I know that you mentioned like ease of use especially for less tech savvy staff was going to be like paramount. So when we signed in, I've got a landing page here that has a lot of like flash and a lot of function on it. You might actually wanna do something like this. Super simple. It is just everything is here, it's one click away. People can just click on something and away they go. That kind of thing. We're gonna put that type of functionality in your hands where you get the ability to design and curate these like this experience the way that you want it to be?\nRANA\n6:27 \nIs it the same landing page… for every, I guess role that we create? Or every like everyone would have basically the same landing page?\nPayment Gateway\nMATT\n6:41 \nYou can actually have it be as differentiated as you would like.

So think of it this way based off the data points that we know, well, people that were getting out of adp, you can trigger associations to different kinds of to different kinds of content. But also the landing page, so that this might be for someone who's like out like, you know, on the floor at a store. And this one could be for an employee who's at the head office.\nLayout & Content\nBENJAMIN\n7:25 \nYeah. Jenna, that was a great question and something I wanted to call out too is these are merely examples of what these page experiences can look like, where me and Matt and I are proud of our creativity, but don't feel restricted by our creativity. These, everything you're seeing the drag and drop widget, so you can really lay out these pages however it is you want, and you can personalize them to certain audiences as much as you feel they need based on what they need to see.\nLayout & Content ends\nRANA\n7:48 \nPerfect.\nMATT\n7:52 \nFrom that uiux perspective, how are you feeling this far? Like, does it look and feel like an F, hi, a product? Like does it, is it meeting your expectations of what an I should do?\nRANA\n8:02 \nYeah, so far? So good.\nMATT\n8:03 \nOkay. All right. Well, if you're okay with like the look, the feel, the next thing I thought I would do is like we're in an LMS, I figured I would show you what the learning actually looks like. Does that seem like a good place to go next?\nLearning Plans\nRANA\n8:15 \nYeah.\nRANA\n8:15 \nPerfectly.\nMATT\n8:17 \nRight. So, hidden behind this button here, I've got a access to what we call a learning plan. Think of this is like if you're gonna take a bunch of courses and string them together to create a greater curricular goal, you can do this with a learning plan. Learning plans are completely optional. Courses. Can 100 percent be stand alone, but say, for example, like you wanted to like with the Professional development scenario that you were mentioning, like someone wants to be on the track to become a manager. Well, one of the things we find in those cases, learning plans are excellent for that because you can do things like putting like start with a course like, you know, like here's a course on de, and I here's a course on, you know, I think, Jen, you use the example of like, you know, like having tough conversations or time management or those types of things they're all great courses on their own. But when you put them together, it equals a management track learning plan and you can track progress across all of it in addition to the individual courses. So.\nRANA\n9:12 \nOkay.\nMATT\n9:13 \nCool… inside that learning plan though that's where the courses themselves come in. So let's jump into a course to show you what that looks like. This one is designed to be E learning. So a synchrony, people will be taking this on their own. Now, we probably want to spend a ton of time in here because let's face it. This is the kind of learning that you probably just expect an LMS to do. Like if I click on this and show you a video playing that's not going to be impressive to anyone because that's just what you expect the lands to be able to do. But one of the things that makes us unique in the space or one of the things that we help you with in terms of in terms of this type of functionality, is we're taking that those types of resources and allowing you to structure them in whatever order you want and then track the progress across them and you can do things like prerequisites where some resources only unlock after other resources do or other resources are complete.\n\n###\n\n","completion":"  • Rana inquired if the same landing page could be used for each role created; Matt confirmed that this was possible, allowing users to personalize according to their needs.\n• Jen mentioned that ease of use, especially for less tech-savvy staff, is paramount. \n END"}
{"prompt":"MATT\n10:11 \nNow, I know you had a couple of like preferences for like premade content as well as like self created content. We're gonna talk about the difference between those a little bit more on the administrative side. But just know like once you essentially like what you're looking at right now is the container for all those different types of resources that you put together.\nIntegrations ends\nMATT\n10:31 \nAnd they can be things that are professionally created that you get off the shelf from somebody like a, one of these files right here… from a like, are you familiar with some of the like interactive file types like score to the terms like score X API, things like that? Have you ever encountered those before or is that new?\nRANA\n10:50 \nNo, it's new guys.\nMATT\n10:51 \nOkay. Don't think of them as they're just like there's special file types that get made with some software that are like interactive courses. You've probably seen some of these interacted with them at jobs at some point in time, just not knowing that they were a special type of file.\nRANA\n11:05 \nGotcha. Okay. Yeah, I used to, in my former company, we used Cornerstone. We were, I was higher education. So I'm familiar with using analmis, I've just never implemented analamis.\nMATT\n11:22 \nYeah. Most people have interacted with them, right? And so one of the things that you're gonna find is that like pretty much everything that would be in Cornerstone would be one of these types of files. Like it's actually called the scorm file. It's just an interactive resource. So, if you're a, think of it this way, if you're purchasing any type of content or you're getting it provided by like a Professional designer, it will probably come as a scorm file.\nRANA\n11:48 \nGot… cool.\nMATT\n11:53 \nIn terms of knowledge checks, what's your current assessment strategy look like? How do you tell you you've done a training? How do you tell that people got something?\nSmall Talk\nRANA\n12:08 \nWe don't nine times out of 10, we know because that they got nothing out of it because it went in one ear and right out the other, they just continue to do the same thing over. So we just crossed, hope for the best, just cross our fingers, hope they listened to us and usually they don't so they're in our office a week later and we're reprimanding them for not listening. I wanted something that was interactive and engaging so that they really paid attention to it.\nSmall Talk ends\nMATT\n12:42 \nGotcha. So by the way, don't worry you're in the same boat as 90 percent of L and D departments. That problem is not unique to you.\nRANA\n12:53 \nYou better hear.\nMATT\n12:56 \nYeah, don't worry. That is not a reflection on you.\nRANA\n12:59 \nWhat?\nMATT\n13:00 \nI figured I would do though. So because we encountered this scenario a lot, what I wanted to do is just show you we have three types of assessment built into the platform that might be of use to you and you can tell me what your thoughts are on them. The first one being like a test builder. So you get the ability to construct like classic sat, you know, like Jen, if you were in higher education, the classic sat style questions right here are three or four answers. Pick one of them here are three or four answers. You can select as many as you want.\nRANA\n13:29 \nOkay.\nMATT\n13:29 \nThose types of questions you get to build these construct question banks, do whatever you want and assign them to the courses as you see fit. So that's the primary assessment method, but like, is that something you would use? Or do you want me to?\nRANA\n13:44 \nYeah, yeah, absolutely. That's awesome. So like we can customize, we can use one of the, you know, pre made trainings, and then at the end, customize the quiz as to what we wanna make sure we get out of them.\nMATT\n13:58 \nYes, exactly. So, like if someone supplied you with like a scoring file or something like that, you could build your own assessment after it of like, hey, you know, by, with contextual things like, yeah, this was something on, you know, an off the shelf thing on how to lift, but you could actually say, okay, within our own warehouses. You know, what is the, you know, where do you find the equipment to do this? That kind of?\nIntegrations\nBENJAMIN\n14:20 \nCool. To that point, I will say like some of the premade content that you might be, you know, purchasing directly from us, might have quizzes or things like that built into those pieces of content as well. I will just depend from provider to provider and we'll talk about that more later in this call. But I do think it's good to note that like within these E learning courses, you can stack content that might be some of your own content with Docebo content that would be more general. And then you could have your own quizzes after as well. You can, you know, create these courses. However it is that you would want to. Yeah, cool.\nIntegrations ends\nMATT\n14:53 \nThat's actually really good point. Just like Ben was saying. Just because you take something off the shelf doesn't mean you can't surround it with your own stuff.\nRANA\n15:01 \nCool. Okay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rana said they know their learners don't get anything out of their training because they continue to do the same thing. \n END"}
{"prompt":"MATT\n50:45 \nSo what we're like you could add their own, but the idea is that this like plugging in the article and then just having to come in and clean up some of the materials should allow you to produce a resource. And like 15 or 20 minutes. It shouldn't take you very long to be able too. So just figured I would make you aware of what that is. Once you've got it. The Shape is very easy to add to the platform. It's just as simple as grabbing listing that we call an API file and uploading it into the system. Okay? So from a creation perspective that's what we have to offer. But again, if you've got a marketing team producing videos for you, chances are you're just gonna upload the videos? This is also where you author the tests so you can go ahead and create the test here… save changes. And then here's your question types… and that's really it from constructing the course perspective, it's usually goes together very quickly and easily. Like you add the materials, you put three, you'll put a video in, make a test, add a video, make a test, then maybe have like a cumulative test at the end. That kind of.\nSmall Talk\nRANA\n51:58 \nSee seems.\nMATT\n52:00 \nYeah, we've thrown a lot at you over the last like, you know, like 55 minutes or how's everybody feeling at this point?\nRANA\n52:10 \nI like it. I feel.\nRANA\n52:11 \nI feel good. It seems like we can get people engaged using it and, you know, it's easy enough to use from the employees side. So that's good. And then it makes rain and my life a little easier as well. So.\nSmall Talk ends\nRANA\n52:27 \nAnd the reporting aspect is really good and we can customize and create and, you know, alter it the way we wanna see it. And then however the president wants to see it as well with it seems like minimal effort.\nMATT\n52:44 \nPerfect. Did we miss anything that was like absolutely critical or important or that was like I must have on your list?\nWrap-Up\nRANA\n52:52 \nI…\nRANA\n52:52 \nI don't think so. No, okay.\nBENJAMIN\n52:56 \nWell, I know you weren't at and Matt, I know you weren't asking me how I felt, but I feel really good about things as well. I appreciate all questions and things throughout the course of the call too… this neck like for the rest of your evaluation, we sort of want to tailor it to, however, whatever is important to you all, I heard a couple of things throughout this call in terms of maybe taking a look at some more content.\nWrap-Up ends\nBENJAMIN\n53:20 \nBut I also know having a conversation around pricing and what, you know, the investment in this is going to be is really important as well as like the next two logical steps, what makes the most sense for you?\nRANA\n53:33 \nI, you had mentioned being able to give us access to like a demo that we could play around in. I think that would be a good next step for us to play with it a little bit and see how user friendly it is on our end. Maybe have one of the employees tested to see how user friendly it is on their end. I mean, that would be my fault. But if you think something different.\nOnboarding\nRANA\n53:54 \nNo, that and then pricing, I know that as far as content we can, you know, get into that, you know, I guess once we figure out the pricing, then we just add whatever content from there that's not an issue, but I guess just kind of implementation timeline and things like that would be me.\nBENJAMIN\n54:20 \nDo this, let's do this. If this works for you, let's schedule some time to walkthrough pricing. We can talk through all of the various products and models that we talked about today and what the cost associated with them would be. We can talk around the onboarding experience and what support you're going to get from our team, people support and tech support that you'll get from doc both throughout that experience.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rana expressed satisfaction with the platform, highlighting its user-friendly interface and customizable reporting functions.

{"prompt":"BENJAMIN\n54:42 \nBut I also want to give you access to be able to get in and play around during that time as well. So, let's schedule that pricing call like a week out and then I'll give you access to the platform to tinker around with things.

But during that.\nMATT\n55:08 \nWell…\nBENJAMIN\n55:08 \nWe can let's schedule 45 minutes so that we have enough time to talk about pricing and all of that.

Monday. I'm good. That week, whatever works for you guys. I'm cool.\nBENJAMIN\n55:59 \nCould you do 11 a, M or one PM on Monday?\nRANA\n56:04 \nWhat's better for you? Anything… recap at one on Monday? So if you could do 11?\nRANA\n56:15 \nYeah, I'll do it fine if I have something else with around. Okay? Yeah, a lot is fine.\nRANA\n56:21 \nYeah. So let's do 11 on Monday?\nBENJAMIN\n56:24 \nOkay, perfect. So I will send that calendar invite over right now. What I'll do after this call is I'll send you over an email and it'll have a link to the URL experience.\nNext Steps ends\nBENJAMIN\n56:36 \nIt'll have the log in credentials. It will have a video that will walk you through sort of like what I would look for at your trial. I encourage you to look at the video before. I know, it sounds annoying like I have to listen to a three minute video or whatever.\nNext Steps\nBENJAMIN\n56:49 \nBut I just promise you our biggest nightmare when you're in a trial is that you spend 45 minutes trying to figure something out that we could answer in a minute and a half. And so, if there's any questions that you have or anything that comes up, don't hesitate to reach out, we wanna give you that guidance throughout.\nNext Steps ends\nBENJAMIN\n57:04 \nWe don't you know, we don't expect you to be Docebo experts just because you sat with us for an hour, we'll help you get that.\nRANA\n57:12 \nPerfect. Thank you.\nBENJAMIN\n57:14 \nAll right. Matt, was there anything else that you, I know whenever we give them a trial, I don't know if there was anything that you wanted to say as guidance either?\nUser Permission\nMATT\n57:21 \nThere, you know, what? Just one last thing that we can show very quickly if we're or if one of the things, so from the admin perspective, the credentials that you get from Ben will have like three profiles on them. The ones you saw today, the learner, the admin, and the Power user, the admin has access in the top right hand corner to this help center and it has knowledge base, Docebo university and Docebo communities.\nUser Permission ends\nMATT\n57:42 \nThese are all self serve resources where if you ever do get stuck and you want to do something like I can click on the knowledge base and go, you know, like let's look at, you know, like, you know, course management or something like that and just type in a term. It's open to the internet. You don't need to log in to get here. You can just go find and see some additional things. So just figured I throw that out there as well. There are self serve resources built in.\nRANA\n58:08 \nPerfect. Cool.\nBENJAMIN\n58:10 \nAmazing. All right. So, I'll send you over that invite. Now, you'll get an email from me here within the next 30 minutes that I'll have everything that you need. I'll also include some content resources for you just because I know we haven't gone all the way down the route talking about content. So it'll give you a little bit more insight into things and we can talk about that more wherever we need.\nWrap-Up\nRANA\n58:28 \nPerfect. Thank you guys.

Yours… I understand that too.\nJONATHAN\n0:14 \nYeah. Yeah. It's also. I don't know. I'm in Toronto. So we've also been hit with some cold weather and some snow.\nDARA\n0:22 \nYeah, I was gonna ask like, yeah, that sounds, I'm sure. It's very frigid up there.\nJONATHAN\n0:29 \nYeah. I mean, it's actually been pretty warm winter for our standards. It's all relative, right? I also have two young kids and I find the cold weather is just kind of like the straw that breaks the camel back, you know, you're like now I gotta put them in jackets and whatnot, you know?\nDARA\n0:47 \nYeah, for sure.\nJONATHAN\n0:49 \nSounds like.\nDARA\n0:49 \nYou could.\nJONATHAN\n0:50 \nCheck them on your shoulder and whatever happens.\nDARA\n0:53 \nYeah, that's nice. Yeah, we're we don't I don't even know. I think we have some ice in late 2022 like over the holidays, but they're talking about possible snow tomorrow, we'll see. But if it does hit it's in Virginia. So it's like a wrap. Once that happens, they don't know, they don't…\nJONATHAN\n1:11 \nSo, you're not, I thought for some reason, I thought you were in DC?\nDARA\n1:16 \nI am, but technically, I'm on the Virginia side like Virginia, DC, Maryland. So like there's like a big surrounding area of both Virginia and Maryland that basically are still kind of super close to DC. So I live like right outside like my metro rides still 15 minutes.\nJONATHAN\n1:35 \nThat's pretty good. That's pretty good. Yeah.\nDARA\n1:37 \nSo, it's not too bad, but.\nJONATHAN\n1:43 \nIt doesn't so you guys don't get too much now, the…\nDARA\n1:47 \nNo, I mean… we've had snow in the past, but in Virginia, I don't know if they know how to handle it. I'm from the midwest. So… like Canada is probably closer to my threshold of understanding, like to winter weather. Hey, Emily.\nEMILY\n2:07 \nHi. How's it going?\nDARA\n2:09 \nJust discussing wheather.\nJONATHAN\n2:10 \nYeah, I'm in Toronto. I've I have two young kids and I was complaining how weather is like the straw that breaks my back with the kids because then you got to put them in snowsuits, then one of them ultimately goes to the bathroom, then you guys take them out. Take them in and it's just like Mike and I'd be summer and spring.\nEMILY\n2:29 \nYeah, 100 percent that's like, I guess that's something I have a two year old. So I haven't really had to cross. We've done snow suits, but only in divers. So, I haven't had to deal with like actual getting in and out of suits, bathroom, breaks in and outside to just throw her in the snow when there is like half an inch on the ground and just let her enjoy.\nSmall Talk ends\nJONATHAN\n2:51 \nOkay. Well, I'm with you. I got 18 months and a one month old, but sometimes you just got, I got to change them, you know?\nEMILY\n2:59 \nI mean, that's…\nJONATHAN\n3:01 \nMy responsibility.\nEMILY\n3:02 \nYeah, I.\nJONATHAN\n3:03 \nCan't turn them in. Hi. Well, hey, thanks guys. Thanks so much for jumping on this call. It's always fun. It's always interesting going through like the RFP process when you haven't actually spoken to clients and whatnot. So, I saw some of those follow up questions and I thought it might be worth maybe digging in just a little bit deeper because sometimes things can get lost like over text or we can be endlessly like chatting like back and forth. But before maybe we jump into the particulars of the questions which we definitely want to address, how are things going? Like how are things going with the evaluation at large? Is there anything that would be helpful for us to know over at Docebo?\nEMILY\n3:46 \nYeah, it's going. We've got a lot of things having outside of this process. And so it's you know, it's a busy season I think for us all generally, but… the review process has been good. It's been interesting to get our eyes on the specific proposals and have a sense of, you know, what functionality we can find to support our needs. And, you know, we go through this process every few years and obviously, in this particular space, what's available to us changes pretty drastically in that span of time just because tech goes really fast faster than a lot of things that we're doing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They asked how the evaluation process is going; they are looking at proposals and seeing what tech changes have taken place since their last review. END"}
{"prompt":"EMILY\n4:34 \nSo, it's been interesting just to learn and see what functionality is available. But of course, a lot of what is most pressing to us is, as we go through a procurement process is making sure that we can at a minimum maintain the existing level of service and kind of a both for our staff who are managing the platform and managing our participants in the platform, but also the user functionality and user experience that if we were to change from where we are currently, what that looks like for our users, kind of hence the question around especially our support just because we internally don't have the staff bandwidth to really troubleshoot tech issues or, you know, respond to the number of inquiries just because of the volume of participants that we have and the number of expectations on our staff currently in portfolios.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJONATHAN\n5:29 \nOkay. Awesome. Okay. Good to know. So, and that's kind of where the support questions are coming from then. Yeah, like, and in terms of in terms of the questions that you asked, maybe we'll touch on the support last because maybe that will be sort of where the majority of the conversation will be in terms of badging and certification.\nMobile App\nJONATHAN\n5:48 \nI, that's not a problem at all. Like that comes into the platform. If we ever do provide a demo that's something that we will definitely illustrate in detail for you with the mobile app. Yes, mobile app is fully included and our system is tablet responsive. There is, of course, if you were looking for something additional, there is an option to purchase like what we call a mobile app pusher by no means, is it necessary you'll have full mobile app compatibility without it.\nMobile App ends\nJONATHAN\n6:16 \nBut if that's something that you wanted to maybe have it branded in as an IREX brand. And it also, I think brings a little bit more detail or flexibility with Notifications. I don't know, you know, that's something that maybe we can table for now considering, you know, but that's something maybe I leave that to your discretion… video integration 100 percent. But what did you mean by like you're talking about like Webinar or you talking MP four YouTube vimeo?\nEMILY\n6:45 \nSo there's a couple of things that we would, I guess, you know, as far as video goes, one would be the ability to do live streaming webinars. Typically, we like right now, one of the things that we're doing is using Zoom predominantly and we'll take the recordings of Zoom and place them in our platform for our participants and so that we can add caption, you know. So we upload the recordings of a lot of videos into our platforms, but interested certainly to know if there's like a native streaming or if you do integrate Zoom site or something else and to do those because we do a lot of live webinars but certainly want to record them and house videos that have captions that we can associate with transcripts and that sort of thing.\nCourse Enrollment\nJONATHAN\n7:29 \nYeah, we, that's exactly it. The latter, we have a native integration with Zoom. So this can really be your home to blend formal an informal learning. You can manage that Zoom event in Docebo. And then you can have it recording there afterwards as well.\nEMILY\n7:46 \nOkay. Okay.\nJONATHAN\n7:47 \nOkay. So the last two would be for the customize your urls. Would you be looking for multiple or yes?\nPayment Gateway\nEMILY\n8:00 \nYes. So within IREX, we manage. So there are a number of different programs that would be using the platform for their respective, and all the programs are labeled under different titles and brands. So as an example, we work specifically on a program for full right teachers. And so we wouldn't want our site for our teachers to be branded with IREX.\nMobile App\nEMILY\n8:25 \nWe want it to be branded with full Bright logos, full Bright naming, even in the URL, obviously something that doesn't our funder is very sensitive to seeing like IREX dot, blah blah blah, they wanna see full Bright dot or just no mention of IREX. And then there are other teams who have maybe their own titling and branding and such that they might want to have customized in the same way.\nPayment Gateway\nEMILY\n8:48 \nBut within IREX, there would be a number of different kinds of look and feel to the user experience for our participants.\nJONATHAN\n8:58 \nNot a problem that we would want to add on something that I didn't include in the package yet. We'd want to include what we call extended enterprise. It's kind of a funny name, but, you know, there is a ton of personalization that you can do native to the platform just to our groups and Branches. But for certain use cases, you need that well, for lack of a better explanation, we'll call it the white glove experience where it's a completely different URL. So through extended enterprise, you can do that, right? So, you know, if you needed, I think we sell them in packets of five. So you would get five urls, maybe to start. Maybe you need 15 to start. I mean that's something that we can qualify. But if you needed to add on more to later date, that's not a problem as well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily is seeking the ability to maintain a level of service currently provided, while also considering user experience, staff bandwidth and a high volume of participants and expectations.

{"prompt":"EMILY\n9:42 \nOkay. Got it. And that's the white glove piece would just be additional like an annual fee to maintain those five or 15 unique URL. Okay?\nJONATHAN\n9:54 \nYeah. Yeah. Because it's not something that all use cases require. So… I mean… the pricing in comparison to the cost of the LMS is pretty nominal. And there's always stuff that we can do there, right?\nEMILY\n10:16 \nYeah.\nJONATHAN\n10:16 \nYeah. That's…\nEMILY\n10:17 \nTrue of our current experience, we're used to kind of having to pay additional additionally for those types of asks. But just as trying to be fully informed about what the annual cost would actually look like over the course of the next three years or such a, and what we would anticipate paying for, just making sure that we're clarifying, you know, what comes with the package for the per user cost versus what would be, you know, additional layers of added one off costs or annual recurring fees, just that to customize to our specific needs.\nOnboarding\nJONATHAN\n10:57 \nRight, right. The last question being around support, right? So, I think the thing we, I need to understand first and foremost, you kinda touched upon this when we first start talking. Would this support be for the administrators, like the people running the LMS, or this be for end users like, you know, the learners themselves?\nEMILY\n11:23 \nPredominantly for the end users. So, yeah, I think, you know, usually our administrators need the nine to five, nine to six support or we would be scheduling kind of support calls or planning calls to get things set up or make sure that we're you know, that we're we have the functionality that we need to launch a program or launch a course, but that the around the clock pieces is really needed for the end user because we have, you know, how many thousands of folks in so many different time zones that we just can't okay.\nMobile App\nEMILY\n12:04 \nWe would love to not have to be able to, you know, staff some sort of like 24 seven help desk, but be able to offer that to our folks so that they're not flooding our program inboxes with questions around like what browser do I need to use to access this platform? I can't like, you know, log in and we're you know, troubleshooting issues around Chrome or safari or?\nMobile App ends\nJONATHAN\n12:25 \nRight, right. So, yeah, because for the administrators, like we can offer that it comes at an extra cost, but I gotta be honest, we have a ticketing system that is great. You know, there's certain sla, they usually respond like within 16 business hours maximum. If it's urgent, it's often less. So I've worked with some enterprise clients who we've kind of shelved it and they've tried our ticketing system. And then if they felt like it wasn't sufficient, like they could always purchase the 24 seven support for administrators at a later date. It's never happened like the ticketing system works great. In some ways. It's better than a phone call. I don't know about you. Any time I call anyone these days, it feels like it's like 45 minutes minimum and it's not the best experience. Okay. Now, for the end user support that's not something that doc will offers reason being it's just not something that a lot of our clients needed.\nAbout Docebo\nJONATHAN\n13:21 \nI think at one point we consider doing it, but the cost of it just didn't make sense. From business perspective. What we do offer though, that doesn't mean that we can offer it is, this is when we would engage with our services team. So they have a network appliance that we work with that we can bring in because we do offer this through our network team of 24 seven support.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJONATHAN\n13:43 \nBut in terms of cost, this is where it's not fine. I would need to bring services in. They would need to kind of just qualify the opportunity they could. And then they could provide you with the cost at that time. So the short answer is yes, the not fun answers because I don't know about you. I like having all my costs right away is we just need to qualify that like with someone on our services team.\nEMILY\n14:04 \nOkay. Got it. That makes sense. Yeah. And I mean, it's good to hear, you know, the clarification around your client experience and how, you know, they've tried out the ticketing system and apparently don't seem to trend in the direction of meeting the 24 seven, you know, additional like service add on, but.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily and Jonathan discussed the additional annual fee for maintaining unique URLs.\n• They also talked about pricing in comparison to cost of the LMS and additional one-off or annual recurring fees.\n• The support discussed was mainly for end users, with a ticketing system offered which is often better than a phone call.

{"prompt":"JONATHAN\n14:28 \nYeah. And I'm running through this really quickly. You also have a dedicated account manager at Docebo and you can set up calls with them at a cadence that you like. And, you know, we recommend being proactive, right? Maybe having a biweekly or monthly meeting at minimum so you can get ahead of these items.\nOnboarding ends\nJONATHAN\n14:49 \nBut from an administrative point of view, I mean, you have a ton of resources. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to go online. We have a really incredible knowledge base. We have a ward winning university as well. What I love about the university is essentially there's a video there for any question that you might have.\nAbout Docebo\nJONATHAN\n15:09 \nSo, yeah, there's a ton of support but… and again, yeah. So we would just need to engage services and go through them. We have some great partners who might go to name them right now who are just fantastic at that support. So you'd be better off having them manage that the end user support then that Docebo? Yeah.\nEMILY\n15:31 \nMakes sense. Yeah. And you said, I know that this wasn't in the questions I don't think that we sent, but in the proposal, I think it, you referenced the size of the company. I think there was like something like 800 plus staff and you have offices in many different time zones. It appears like very global.\nJONATHAN\n15:52 \nYeah. We were founded in Italy. So we, we're a very much a global company… offices throughout the United States, Canada, London, Australia, obviously, Italy as well. You know, we're also a publicly traded company. So if you ever go to Docebo, dot com and scroll all the way down to the bottom, I believe there's like an investor relations. So if you were, I mean in this economy, I'd be silly. Not if you were kind of curious just about our company and like it's health by all means like feel free to look at, we're pretty much an open book because we're publicly traded. Yeah.\nEMILY\n16:33 \nThat's great. Yeah.\nAbout Docebo ends\nEMILY\n16:35 \nWell, I appreciate the answers to those questions. I'm trying to think if there's anything in those lines that bears flushing out anymore?\nJONATHAN\n16:48 \nYeah. I mean… how many, you know, how many vendors are you guys are you looking at? Is this an exercise in, hey, we're up for renewal with our current provider? We kinda wanna see what else is out there which is totally fine. You know, companies would be silly not to do that. You know, I'm sorry, so forth, right? But, or is this more like, you know, we are kind of looking to potentially make a change because of reasons XYZ with our current provider.\nEMILY\n17:19 \nIt's a little, I mean, it's a little bit of both. So, you know, we've got just a few folks kind of in the running for this request for proposals, but of course, like we're not eager to make such a, you know, significant change without it being kind of a, there's no sure thing in life but without significant amounts of confidence that a change would result in either same provision of service or something better.\nAbout Docebo\nEMILY\n17:52 \nEspecially, you know, even just thinking about the size and health of the, you know, is important to us because we've and not necessarily in this space, but in shifting to other, you know, whether it's a travel company or somebody, you know, that promises during the sales pitch that they can provide and sustain what it is that the size of our organization and complexity of organization requires with the different projects that we need to manage. And then I can't deliver on those promises. And so that's one of the things you know, we're looking for even just the size and breadth of your operations is encouraging just because we… it speaks to capacity that we mentioned in the request for proposals. We're looking for not just price competitiveness but also the capacity to actually manage our needs.\nOnboarding\nEMILY\n18:45 \nSo we are a little bit behind the process. We everybody kind of an email today just because today was meant to be the day that we're making the final decision and notifying folks. But we probably are going to need a little bit more time on this just as we get these answers to our questions and really give the proposals a, you know, a due amount of consideration because they are, you know, really robust and so, excuse me, I've got a frog in my throat this morning.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily is considering other vendors for their request for proposal and is looking for price competitiveness as well as capacity to manage their needs.\n• They are behind on their decision making process.

{"prompt":"EMILY\n19:14 \nI'm guessing ready for the weekend. So yeah, that's it's just a few groups in the running and we're not like we would want to be thoughtful about making any shifts at this moment. But also, you know, we are, we're predominantly government funded and so this is a required part of our process, you know, to procure and compete contracts of this scale just because we have to be responsible with the tax payer dollars. So.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJONATHAN\n19:46 \n100 percent to your first point and I can even think you fair, you know, we have a, we have a case study here on our website. I can share it in the Zoom chat. Maybe I'll email it to you as well. So just to give you an idea like this is Zoom, we're on a Zoom call right now.\nAbout Docebo\nJONATHAN\n20:01 \nSo we have their customer academy, they partner with us. So we're engaging with over 600,000 learners, right? We're working with like a tick talk on their influencer academy with an Amazon with a walmart, just to sorta speak that the scope and size of your project is something that we're accustomed to.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJONATHAN\n20:24 \nBut to that other piece, you know, I don't envy you guys when you're going through all the different vendors, I speak to clients all the time. It's at times it's almost overwhelming. There's so many vendors. So understand the need to take time. But yeah, I mean, we would want to obviously run through a demonstration with you, make sure that you guys can see the platform if you wanted.\nOnboarding\nJONATHAN\n20:44 \nWe could also provide you with the trial. So you can, you know, look at some of the click paths and we would of course want to speak to our services team, let you know what is available to you with Docebo in terms of helping out with implementation. Our standard onboarding is fantastic.\nOnboarding ends\nJONATHAN\n21:00 \nWe've literally done it with thousands of clients, but sometimes certain use cases require more help. So we can provide that again at your discretion if you want it. We would also speak to a solution architect to make sure that all the tech works. So, you know, they make sure that everything that I've said to you actually is true, but we have all those I want to assure you we have all those checks and balances here. It would be a project obviously moving from your current provider to a new one. So just let us know right where we're you know, we're happy to sort of do the dance, go go through the motions with you and make sure that if you do in fact decide to make this change, that you feel good about it at the same time or at least as good as can be. Yeah.\nWrap-Up\nEMILY\n21:46 \nI appreciate that. I appreciate your time. We're gonna go back into our reading and reviewing mode and conversation around some of this and follow up with you and some of the other folks we have to talk with about this and kinda discuss our next steps and the direction we're going in.

{"prompt":"JOSHUA\n4:13 \nSo a couple of things that I wanted to talk about. So there's…\nSCOTT\n4:16 \nYeah.\nJOSHUA\n4:17 \nSo I have my last email to you there was we were lower but I can appreciate that. We're good, bring a better system. So… put into consideration the thing that's not in consideration in line, is this the implementation fee that just comes as just a additional lump of cost.\nPricing ends\nJOSHUA\n4:38 \nSo I need to think of it in terms of an annual. So I would effectively have to break that out over three years and then just add that in my comparison. And then my question for you on a functionality basis because as we mentioned, we do have a lot of them, but we also are intensive in training early through a kind of a programmatic function.\nPricing\nJOSHUA\n5:02 \nAnd later there are there's an annual training. There's a couple of pieces, but really a lot of the like a longer terms of organization. I'd say a third are pretty much shown within a year or two, a third state for a reasonable kind of typical duration. And then a third are what I call like a lot of 15 2025 30 your employees here. Once you're beyond that three to five years, really, you are, there isn't there's annual recertification, but there isn't a whole lot of training. So we at 300 users monthly, that is 300 people in courses and we have unlimited dormant users. So people that are registered, we keep their profiles but they are actively engaged in learning.\nSCOTT\n5:49 \nYeah. And you can control like you can limit access like it just like you don't have to go in and delete records to make room for new folks.\nJOSHUA\n5:57 \nSo, so that's what I just wanna make sure because that's part of my argument in terms of being able to support. This would also be ability to grow kind of with the company that this user agreement as it stands… we can really scale up to 600 employees because we're not actively training 600 at a time. So just so I'm just as I can be. So if you're a user in Docebo, you have all of your kind of accolades training, all of your profile from that profile, you can just sit on the side and not be counted in a 300 until you're actively inserted or registered into a course.\nCertifications\nJOSHUA\n6:36 \nYou then become one of the active users. When registered, when that course is completed, the certification comes across, you then go back to this dormant state where we keep records, but we don't actively engage with.\nSCOTT\n6:47 \nAnd that just resets each month. And this kind of like some nuances like what actually tracks it in our system is there's a couple of things like if they're marked as attended for an ILT, if they've actually like opened a course, and like that course has started. So there are some nuances like if you hired somebody and they, you know, got registered for a course and they quit the first week and they never went in like they're not active if I just.\nJOSHUA\n7:10 \nSo my next part was that we do have, we have a lot of people that sign up and in the first week decide the job is in for them and they leave.\nPricing\nJOSHUA\n7:20 \nI would hate for that to be considered. You know, they completely course that they leave the next day to be considered a monthly active user.\nSCOTT\n7:26 \nYeah. So in that scenario, they still would be just for that month, a monthly active. So if they're in once in a month, they can take as much content as they want.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n7:34 \nYou could run a three week program with them that's up to you. But basically, if they trigger, once they're like in that seat that's…\nJOSHUA\n7:43 \nAnd that's entering a clause or completing a clause?\nSCOTT\n7:46 \nThat is, yeah, just entering the class.\nJOSHUA\n7:49 \nSo if we have someone that on the week before it says up, coming in comes on Monday in a class puts at lunchtime and leaves, they are an active user.\nSCOTT\n7:59 \nIf they're in the LMS platform, then yes.\nJOSHUA\n8:01 \nOkay. These are make it, I'm just trying to understand the limits of what kind of what we get.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Joshua discussed implementing a system that has an additional lump cost and need to consider it as an annual cost, broken out over 3 years. \n• 300 monthly users are registered for courses, with unlimited dormant users. \n• Their training usually lasts three to five years; after that, there is annual recertification, but not extensive training.  END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n8:09 \nYeah, for sure. And there is some benefits to like for your tenured employees like let's just say you do like an annual recertification or you need them to upload their, I don't know.\nCertifications\nSCOTT\n8:19 \nI'll say like CF, a certificate, not a CA, I don't know how they do that. But if you go to like your user record or if you just like go up and pull a past certificate again, you're still not active, or if you browse content and leave you're not active.\nCertifications ends\nJOSHUA\n8:31 \nAnd what have you review content that you've already been certified?\nSCOTT\n8:35 \nIf you are going back in, I'd have to check on that one. I think if you're viewing content again, that is trigger.\nJOSHUA\n8:42 \nOkay. I'm just trying to understand because I'm… because it's an interesting comparison. Obviously, this is on a raw user count which is much higher, but this has the potential to service much more users if we are efficient with how we utilize the courses.\nPricing\nJOSHUA\n8:59 \nBut I'm just trying to wrap my head around it. I do think that this pricing is gonna be a bit of a hurdle. I know. I listen, you're easy to deal with. You came in pretty swiftly got into the ballpark, we weren't there, but we were, I didn't think that if the software works for our users and we never exceeded the 300 user about account, I don't think we do that was we were going to get something but this kind of had one 35 percent.\nSCOTT\n9:29 \nYeah. And this is what I'm showing you right now. Like I haven't applied the discount to. This is just like the out of the box. So it'd be, you know, take the one applied the other one like the 2029 percent. So it's more around like the 1,616 18.\nJOSHUA\n9:48 \nYeah.\nSCOTT\n9:49 \n18 or 19 Canadian, but I know you mentioned you were spending around like what 13 today is kinda like the delta you have to compare.\nJOSHUA\n9:58 \nYeah, that's pretty close to the where I'm comparing for more users but at the same time, I am more than happy to understand how your system works.\nPricing ends\nJOSHUA\n10:05 \nUnderstand that's a premium. I was happy to assign some premium to it. That's not a problem because obviously we have concerns and issues with lives. And also as we grow organization, I think we kinda use it with max in more for it, do for us where she has some other features that over time you may be interested in terms of other features and modules that get added.\nIntegrations\nJOSHUA\n10:28 \nOn top of this… what it sounds the, your course library are those. So your course library is a… monthly or annual package to access or it's a per piece of media rent or pay structure.\nSCOTT\n10:52 \nOurs is. So basically you have access no matter what program you like package you pick to the 90,000 courses we basically select. They've got three packages, one's 50 courses, one's 150. And one is just premium unlimited use as many as you want. And typically, what happens is like through onboarding, you sit down with our curation specialists. You get assigned like a partner on our side. They would say like, hey, like what topics do you want to fill these say 50 courses with you'll? Look at maybe a few different options of each. You have access to the whole library, but they'll give you suggestions. So you're not filtering through, you know, thousands of courses. But once you bring that in, you can swap them out yearly too. So if you know, priorities change or something happens on in terms of like again courses that are going well, or maybe these things that are under utilized, you want to switch up topics, you can do that annually.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n11:43 \nWhereas like the premium packages, just move them in and out as much. And as often as you as you'd like.\nJOSHUA\n11:49 \nAnd what are the, what are the cost of those packages? I don't think we've ever been more than 50 for a given year as we play around a base cost of that.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n11:59 \nSo there's a couple of things I should highlight for you. So this is really like the core that I think gets navy like everything that she has today plus a lot of like the administrative benefits that are causing her some headaches like operations and enrollments. There was one thing to consider and I think this is something that's like, I think you could probably build us more into like, you know, where do you go with their table as a partner?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott outlined the benefits of annual recertification and uploading certifications like CF.\n• Joshua expressed interest in understanding the pricing structure, comparing it to a current system they use.\n• Joshua said the pricing will be a hurdle.\n• Scott provides an overview of three pricing packages with unlimited access to 90,000 courses and the ability to swap out courses annually.\n• Joshua asked about the cost of each package and Scott outlined additional options available as a partner.

{"prompt":"SCOTT\n12:21 \nIt's something called discover coach and share is our informal learning module but it was kind of where you can where you can take advantage of subject matter experts. It's more of like the informal knowledge management. If you want to have a channel on, you know, RBC and have like notes of the week pop up there and invite folks to watch.\nCoach & Share ends\nSCOTT\n12:40 \nIt's. A good spot for that. So that's something you may want to consider down the road, but I know still being budget conscious.\nJOSHUA\n12:47 \nYeah. So what I like to do sometimes to the shagrin of my partners and sometimes they appreciate it. I like to look at all the options and I like in our contract to have these prices fixed. What I wanna do is I want to confirm that I have an option to add this on an annual basis, but I may not take it on year one. I may get used to get everything up and running. And in your to say we want to activate this. And I like definitely would want the pricing from the time that we signed up as opposed to next year pricing because pricing seems to only go in one direction.\nSCOTT\n13:16 \nI've done that before. So like a locked in kinda like rate card. Yeah, yeah, we can definitely.\nJOSHUA\n13:23 \nOkay. So the other thing that I wanted to do and I don't know if my got to it was I wanted to kinda play in the sandbox a little bit and have her and upload a course, go through the process of downloading a report. I know that we did that the demo but giving a little bit of kind of free time on the platform whether it's guided or whether it's just us logging in for an hour and playing around if we could set that up. That would be great. And then just to take a look at your cause I kinda wrap my head and spoke to some people on previous number. I know that there's I know it was a mistake. So I don't think it's a bad and switched, but I do know have some things to discuss and the gap is, has widened. So I appreciate kind of on the first instance you came in and said, listen, this is, it wasn't a back and forth. It was like cards on the table. It may the some fine tuning from here, but this is kinda where it is. Now we're looking… at.\nSCOTT\n14:20 \nIt is that same if we're okay with the us dollars, but, you know, I really apologize for that.\nJOSHUA\n14:26 \nNo, it's okay. I don't happen if I get it.\nPricing\nJOSHUA\n14:30 \nBut if you can just relook at that number and give me kinda the best and final Canadian, that would be appreciated. And then one other question I have is how firm is Docebo? And I don't think this will be an issue for us particularly in years one or two is on the 300? If it's three one, are you gonna lock out or is it like there's a small five percent, three percent of flex if you dance around that?\nSCOTT\n14:56 \nYeah. So ours is actually, it's an overage. So if you do go over, say you got 301, it's five dollars and 90 cents for that user in that month that just gets billed separately. So yeah, it's just basically we're never gonna like stop somebody from coming in. We don't want like a negative user experience of access? So.\nJOSHUA\n15:13 \nAnd that I assume would then eventually be applied with the same discounting, whatever the total price is off that number. I.\nSCOTT\n15:20 \nDo you have some flexibility there too? So yeah, I…\nJOSHUA\n15:23 \nI really don't think this initially. I think that in the next year or two years, we're pretty solid that will be under that number. But our business kind of fluctuates in numbers. We were pretty pandemic at like 640 active and we kind of drop down as we've used some technology and some of the business has changed through the pandemic because we're doing kind of a lot more fewer people. But now we're starting to see the ramp come back up. So we kind of drop down to our lowest which was 270. And then now we're back kind of up at the three 33 40 range and we're picking up six people a week or something not to say that they're all going to be active in learning. But I do see a potential that we would be growing beyond our size potentially the three year period.\nSCOTT\n16:09 \nThink too if it helps with your business case that like, you know, given our user model, like you can grow and this plan will probably good for you from 350 employees up to 455 100.\nJOSHUA\n16:19 \nAnd then once you get beyond that, you really should be moving up the next steps.\nSCOTT\n16:24 \nOne other thing I can mention too is like with like that overage. So you do get Notifications from a platform. You have an in platform tracker. You're not blind to like users. So if you need to like manage, hey, we're getting close. We've got a big compliance thing, you know, let's launch on March second instead of February 20 seventh. You can that too. Obviously, I don't think you really want to be over thinking and managing users. So it's nice to be on the appropriate plan, but you can scale up during the contract or.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Joshua asked to play in the sandbox with free time on the platform to test out features, download reports and wrap his head around Docebo.

{"prompt":"JOSHUA\n16:49 \nYeah, that, that's really the, I don't think that it's gonna be an issue.\nNext Steps\nJOSHUA\n16:52 \nI think that later potentially close to the end will be or maybe I'll just be in time for the next. Okay. So if you wanna find some time next week where we could just kinda play around as opposed to a demo, but actual interactive environment would be great. Or if you just want to send us a log into kind of a sandbox dummy version play around, happy to do that. Also, I will conference with new and just confirm she seemed very positive. But a couple of specific questions I should have got an answer for this call. If you can take a look at the proposal based on what you sent and see just what your best is. And then I should be like I'm pretty quick with these things. Like if it's I don't need to keep things raw busy. So… presumably, if it's not next week, the week after we'll be decided.\nNext Steps ends\nSCOTT\n17:41 \nAnd I appreciate that too. And you've been transparent with me again. I know we are a little bit more of the premium solution. I think there's a good fit here. Obviously, I'll do my best. But again, if it's just not the logical fit, like you can just tell me to like Scott, it's not the right time. Maybe we'll reevaluate soon, but I will do my absolute best. And again, I apologize, I'll…\nPricing\nJOSHUA\n18:00 \nIt happens. And then just a general question was like the question, is there like does you have a run of promotion at a certain time of year? Like is there over summer? Do they do have promotion where it's like on an annual basis, the tens to be further discounting in certain months or certain quarters for reasons for the comp?\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n18:17 \nIt's usually just based on like a use case by use case. I'd say our leadership is more flexible for asks closer to like quarters. We're a publicly traded company. So obviously they're trying to try.\nJOSHUA\n18:30 \nI do need to confirm when if we decide it's a go, I then need to confirm how and at what date? Do I cancel the limit end… in a way where we're not kinda paying two goals at once.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n18:46 \nSo I just wanna ask you, yeah, what date or do you know what the contract?\nJOSHUA\n18:50 \nAre off of a contract with we're just on an annual basis? Okay? But we haven't been billed yet. Exactly what terms, but say it's gonna be in less than six, less than 12 months, but I haven't been billed. I can always just pick up on call and pay rated monthly for what we've used or maybe complete out the month and then so off. So I'm not overly worried about that. And then the one other thing that we spoke to, I think in our first meeting, I just want to remind you of one of the things that I need from a software partner that for a transition is a period where we can have live and have kind of a sandbox version of Docebo where we have a month to use it to upload all of our things. So that on the day that we start paying, it becomes valuable to.\nSCOTT\n19:42 \nYeah. So a couple of creative options there. I think one thing that would work well and why I was asking you kind of about the Litmos time line, I mean, I think we're in a good position here if like signing within March is possible for me to make the case. Usually if I'm asking for big discounts, they're gonna ask me Scott, like when can they sign by? So I think that option, like maybe I don't know if you want to double check with Litmos yet. I can get you like the theoretical where we're at. But before I mean I got to get like three chains of approval if we're going to the side of discount.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n20:12 \nSo just before I do that, I want to confirm with you like, hey, we're the right partner. Yes, we want to go down that path with the.\nJOSHUA\n20:20 \nSo, I think the, there's two ways that I think we can do number one, let's get the stuff done next week just so we can have the interactive I can speak with, maybe get those confirmed. And then I can, I am willing, I'm happy to let you to tell me. Let's this is the highest discount I've got there's. No guarantee I can get this but this is where what I'm asking for. And before you even make the ask, I can confirm with you if that number works. Now. That makes the most sense. So I don't want number one, I don't want you to go go to bat and then you get what you asked for and I still say no, that's not fair to you at the same time, I want to know the best price to make sure because now I'm looking at a wider clevage between the two. And I do think that it's… the right fit based on my brief discussion with my, I should have a more folsom and we want to just go the process of uploading, taking one of our courses, putting it out. And then somehow maybe in the back end, you can fill out a whole bunch of use it take so guys so we can pull a report. And just those are the two functions that are critical and they are the reason why we are considering. So I just wanna see those two things.\nSCOTT\n21:27 \nYeah, for sure. We talked about that as next steps but she just wanted to be comfortable with you on pricing first and get that out of the way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Joshua discussed potential solutions to running a demo in an interactive environment, as well as liaising with New to confirm the proposal and any specific questions.\n• Joshua asked about the possibility of promotions at certain times of year, particularly discounts for quarters.\n• Scott clarified that discounts are usually considered on a use case by use case basis, and that if Joshua is able to sign within March there will be more flexibility when it comes to offering discounts.\n• They discussed the need for extra features such as allowing users to upload courses, pulling reports from the back end, and having a sandbox version available for a month before payment is due. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n21:34 \nYeah, we'll do a trial time. I can send over some access. I recommend probably a guide of 30 minutes with me and Ivy. Let's just go through. Let's do a couple of things together. It's easy to use, but it's a new platform. So just… do last thing I was gonna mention was just on that idea of like how do we overlap this in the best way where you're not double paying?\nOnboarding\nSCOTT\n21:55 \nSo we have some creative ways to do it. I'd say there may be a little bit of a theoretical gap but let's just say we decided we were gonna sign in March thirtieth or before hopefully, but we could actually push the start date out anywhere up to three months in the future where we can get you access to what for your main platform. But the only thing I'd say is your technical onboarding support like your STM assignment starts from the start date pick. So I can help out. We can give you early access. You can get a lot of the things prepared access to.\nJOSHUA\n22:30 \nBut the support is obviously it needs to come over. Okay? I get it.\nOnboarding ends\nSCOTT\n22:34 \nThat's exactly.\nJOSHUA\n22:35 \nNo problem. So I think that's enough because I think with some basic instructions and our team is pretty good, we have a pretty sophisticated. So because of our business, we have a pretty large it team and we have unlike most companies, we have both hard and soft.\nOnboarding\nJOSHUA\n22:49 \nSo we have a technical support hardware team. We also have a full coding programmer team. So we have the technical prowess for someone to dive in for a couple of days and be proficient in these modules or the software. So I think we can, I think that would work at work because we may just have some support or we can ask a couple of questions, and then really it's getting everything that we have on a like for like basis.\nOnboarding ends\nJOSHUA\n23:15 \nAnd then when the service starts, it's all about. Okay. We're not paying a premium. What more can we do with this platform to justify this investment?\nSCOTT\n23:21 \nYeah. Well, honestly, it's like the best scenario too because if you get some of the baseline things done when you kick off with their STM like you're already almost like at the point where you're ready to go our platform technically from day one, like you could upload a course and get someone in.\nOnboarding\nSCOTT\n23:36 \nBut we are big on like engagement experience. We like to do like soft launch and testing and make sure that the first time someone comes in is going to be the optimal experience. So that's where I say it's good to have a maybe an idea there be a little bit across over but I don't think much with some other options.\nJOSHUA\n23:52 \nPerfect. And then did you get an, did we get an answer? One of my basic concerns with what is that you don't get a dedicated account service person, they hit 10,000 that they're baseline for having a dedicated customer success person. And that does have that kind of when there's an issue that is not that is time sensitive, there is a phone number to call someone to speak to that can help out the phone.\nSCOTT\n24:15 \nYeah, that's one thing I'm gonna look to get at just like assigned with him like the onboarding. So it's something we've got, we actually didn't use to have this, but we now do have different levels of like onboarding support. And again, given the pricing difference, it's actually really small between the two options. It's not a dedicated person for call support but there is call support.\nOnboarding ends\nJOSHUA\n24:36 \nWe don't need necessarily a dedicated one. It's more that in the general scheme of things we're fine. There's an email. We have an issue, bug it in. But when we get, because our clients are all the big banks and the big credit graders. When they ask for something, we kinda need it right away. It's like we need this today and that's when the issue happens. So it's not that we'll kind of abuse a hotline, but we do need to have the ability to speak to someone if at all pass.\nSCOTT\n25:05 \nYeah. So that's actually an option within the last year that's become available.\nOnboarding\nSCOTT\n25:08 \nA lot more people are looking for that. I think maybe we used to be on a similar path. We've got live chat in the system like quick questions that's usually like less than five minutes for quick stuff, but totally get, you know, phone support, but you do have a you'll have an account manager assigned to you as well like they're kinda like me. You can reach them any time. And the STM solution deport manager, they're with you during that onboarding, same person every time they're available for quick calls, one off meetings like they're there to help make sure the launch goes perfect.\nJOSHUA\n25:37 \nExcellent. All right. So if you wanna, we'll find some time next week to do that.\nOnboarding ends\nJOSHUA\n25:41 \nIf you want to just take a final look at pricing, I will have the conversation internally need to have and we'll know where we're going in the next week or two.\nSCOTT\n25:50 \nYeah, that's perfect. Last thing I was gonna mention just because I didn't mention it yet again just all in transparency is I know you mentioned about content.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott proposed to sign up before March 30th, with the possibility of pushing out the start date up to three months in advance.\n• Joshua mentioned their business had an IT team with both hard and software skills for proficiency in the modules/software. \n• Further conversation on pricing will take place within the next week or two. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n25:59 \nSo I don't know that we're adding this right away, but in the future, I do have some pricing tiers I can share with you. The one thing I did wanna warn you about is just in terms of the grand scheme of things, it does add a fair bit to the overall project.\nIntegrations\nSCOTT\n26:11 \nWhen you're looking at adding content, it's very common across the industry, you know, depending on, you know, how much content you get from us. But whether you were looking at us or LinkedIn, learning, I know for some folks that you haven't bought content before. It could be like, you know, well, I didn't expect it to cost as much as our platform, but it does so again, you can add.\nPricing\nJOSHUA\n26:34 \nBut I think what was the base here was the 5,000 dollar one that was up there.\nSCOTT\n26:40 \nThat might have been the, that was like a 50 course. So this would be 50 courses from our 70,000 swapped out every year, but there are additional.\nJOSHUA\n26:51 \nWas he a module on one before?\nCoach & Share\nSCOTT\n26:54 \nThis one over coach and share. This one is more for questions and answers like the little widgets that you can add to any piece of content uploading like an expert like quickly sharing a video or a document. So it's more of that like informal learning.\nJOSHUA\n27:13 \nAll right. Okay.\nIntegrations\nJOSHUA\n27:14 \nSo that is definitely, thank you for noting that we don't use it. Currently. We find that our content, we effectively have to create our content because they're just, it's not get more generalized sales training or things like that. But, okay, you gotta pay those 75,000 people to make all that content.\nSCOTT\n27:33 \nWell, if it's you know, again down the road, you don't have to use our content. Either there's a ton of value to it, but some folks do Paris with LinkedIn learning like we got an integration there. Again, their pricing is pretty much on par with ours. It's the same thing.\nJOSHUA\n27:45 \nYeah.\nSCOTT\n27:46 \nSometimes there's folks that just buy like an odd couple of courses from an external provider. You can import them into their Shape two.\nJOSHUA\n27:52 \nPerfect. Easy enough. All right.\nSCOTT\n27:55 \nTo work for you… I will reach out. I'll send over access to you and I today just generally browse over the weekend if you want.\nWrap-Up\nSCOTT\n28:03 \nAnd then if we wanna meet mid week, if she wants to like come with the piece of content, we'll do a couple of things together.\nJOSHUA\n28:08 \nExcellent. All right. Thank you.\nSCOTT\n28:10 \nThanks Joshua.\nJOSHUA\n28:11 \nI…\nSCOTT\n28:12 \nSee you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott discussed adding content and potential pricing tiers to the overall project.\n• Scott offered a meeting mid-week so they can go over the content pieces together.

{"prompt":"RICKY\n6:00 \nDear. So, okay. That is completely on me. I'm messaging him, see if he can hop on. I'm just looking at his calendar and he might be able to, but if not, don't want this to be a complete waste of time. So what I'll do is like I'll open it myself and we can kinda go through it. But I do want him at a certain point in time to kind of do a proper demo and take you through it. So just give me.\nSmall Talk\nPORTEBEN\n6:24 \nNo stress. These things happen. Yeah. Last night with the training, I've sent the link, but I don't know some reason the link corrupted with the presenter from an external company. We're all just waiting. I'd like it's going to be carry time where I'm like, all right, someone's gonna have to sing a song to keep everybody entertained, but you.\nRICKY\n6:51 \nSing a song, go for, right?\nPORTEBEN\n6:53 \nYou don't want to hear my voice. I can.\nRICKY\n6:55 \nI sing.\nPORTEBEN\n6:56 \nShare voice only.\nRICKY\n6:59 \nAbsolutely my fault right here. So what I do is when I set up meetings, I always use, I put his name in the calendar so that he's always on it.\nSmall Talk ends\nRICKY\n7:08 \nAnd I don't know how this because I remember having him on it too. We actually went over at… this particular demo. So until he responds, I'm just doing my own little care, okay here and I will just open it up thankfully Bri, that you're familiar with it. So it's give me a good time to just kinda talk through it. And then I'll certainly bring them on whether it's on a, this is a long process. So we're going to have a lot of opportunity to properly go through some different things whether it's deep dives on the admin side or Power users or things like that. But I definitely want to get this… definitely wanna show you too. So just give me one second as I hop in here.\nMobile App\nRICKY\n7:55 \nWhoops. I'll just share my screen.\nRICKY\n8:05 \nRight there. All right. Can you see my screen? Yep. Yep, awesome. So there's a little bit of work that we're gonna do here. We can put in a photo here. So actually what I did Bri was I looked back at some of your older demos that you actually did a couple of years ago and I tried to kind of emulate that.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n8:27 \nWe have updated our trial instance a little bit. So it's not completely the same but I really liked how you guys have designed it few years ago. So I was like I was talking to so like, yeah, look at this. Let's try to make it kinda similar. Because one, I do know when it was built back then it was actually kinda built to your special specifications anyways.\nLayout & Content ends\nRICKY\n8:46 \nSo I thought that was kind of like a good way to start and starting kind of with this main page. So this is the log in page. And the reason why we have it looking like this and we can, we'll fix this up a little more to the purpose of this is that if you're doing eCommerce, you can actually have folks see like your course catalog before they've actually logged in.\nLearning Plans\nRICKY\n9:09 \nSo I mean the option is completely up to you how you want that to look and feel in terms of the UI or us. The point of this is just to show that you actually can show of course catalog. These course cards would be your learning plans or your courses right now.\nPayment Gateway\nRICKY\n9:23 \nIt says E learning. But if this was one for purchase, it would actually show the price. And then if someone were to click into it, how to go through the process of purchasing that course. So I know eCommerce is something that's important to you all. Just want to give you that idea what you can do here as well. We have a subscription catalogs. If subscriptions was something that you were looking for in the future, you can absolutely do it either via purchasing individual courses or actually buying subscriptions as well. So.\nRACHEL\n9:55 \nBeen just to clarify for most of our stuff is not eCommerce. And the way that you would think of here's a program pay 50 bucks to our program. It is more linked eCommerce linking to like our, a purchasing site for our actual diets. So it's you have education, but it links off to… an online purchase for the diets separate. So.\nRICKY\n10:22 \nPerfect. Yeah, you can link people out too.\nTIM\n10:25 \nHey, everyone. Sorry, I had to jump off for there real quick but this is Tim.\nPayment Gateway ends\nTIM\n10:30 \nI could see it again virtually. So Rachel, you were saying, so can you explain that a little bit deeper just in terms of, so they would have access? Because I know the last time that we spoke it's I know it's a little bit different… in the different areas right? Where you have to, you know, within the states, you kinda want them to friends to invite friends in. But in other areas in Europe and such, they have to be invited, right? They have to be given that. So when you say eCommerce, I just wanna understand that a little bit deeper.\nRACHEL\n11:11 \nYeah. So we have being a pet food company, we are very science based cat and dog first, which means a lot, we have a lot of diets and there's just a lot of education that needs to happen through the different channels to make sure people best use our diets and understand nutrition and what is best for pets. And that is really the purpose of having an LMS system is how do we educate people on pet nutrition, know wherever they happen to be doing and what their work apps to be? And that is all for free. So we want to make sure you know, everyone knows what is best to do for their cat or dog at home.\nTIM\n12:00 \nMake, I have a French bull dog. So that relates heavily to me because they.\nRICKY\n12:04 \nYeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ricky and Porteben discussed the upcoming meeting, which included training and a proper demo. \n• Ricky discussed the layout and content of their mobile app, as well as learning plans, subscription catalogs and linking out to payment gateways. \n• Rachel clarified that their product was not eCommerce in terms of purchasing directly through the system, but linked out to an online purchase site. \n END"}
{"prompt":"RACHEL\n12:05 \nYeah. So, so give in that example, you know, you've got a French bull dog and you're wondering where to get information, can we have direct consumer maybe at some point? But if we are educating people on retail store. So if you go down to your mom and pop… you know, pet store and you talk to and the people there that they have been educated and they're giving you real nutrition information and not marketing gotcha. So, so that is the hope, right? And that really is wrapped up in the vet space, right? When we start looking at what we can do for, you know, the skin, right? Yeah.\nTIM\n12:49 \nYeah, that makes sense.\nBRI\n12:51 \nMuch of our eCommerce conversations with like Lee and in general in the past have been for our vetonary professionals in the us, this could change, but they kinda have like a learn and earn. And so the more they learn, they get points and they get to exchange those points for a discount on their personal pet food. And so that's kind of where that eCommerce connection was also coming from. Is that taking the points that they earn on the learning site? You know, my dream state would be that if we take away, if everybody just gets the flat out discount, maybe they can take it for a Royal can and shirt or something like that in the future or whatever. But just being able to earn points in exchange that as well?\nPORTEBEN\n13:40 \nYeah, I agree. I second what Bri said, we're looking at a global level of really implementing incentivization. So as Marie said, yeah, you earn points, you redeem points just like frequent flyer points or whatever. So that way, yeah, especially for the nurses, we know that they tend to go through the programs and courses a lot more if you incentivize them with a free bag of food or a water bottle or whatever it may be. So that's kind of the premise of using… the eCommerce initially.\nPayment Gateway\nTIM\n14:20 \nOkay. So when we say eCommerce, we're really talking… it's not really on our site. You're really on the back end. So it's…\nRACHEL\n14:29 \nReally?\nTIM\n14:30 \nYou're going to give access to people? So we don't have to worry about the having a spot for subscriptions and things like that. That's an option as you can see, we put that in there if that's something you want to do later on down the road. But, okay. So we don't even really have to worry about the eCommerce on our side. So correct that more. Okay?\nPORTEBEN\n14:49 \nSo it's good to know because in future, we may decide to change things, but yeah, at this stage, we certainly don't require a specific call out for subscriptions.\nPayment Gateway ends\nRACHEL\n15:01 \nYeah, it's more of gamification and can we have some sort of API connection to our purchasing site, right? So, or whatever we happen to land on?\nRICKY\n15:12 \nThat was going to be my next question. I'm really happy you brought that up. How do you get the points or how do you want that?\nPayment Gateway\nRICKY\n15:17 \nAnd we'll get into that too. I'll show you that too. But as you mentioned in the future, Ben, this is also about future proofing. So exactly just knowing that this is available, this like this doesn't even have to be here. You can have a course catalog in the system if that's where you wanted to do some E commerce. So the options are there and something that we do pretty well. So I definitely want to point that out. Sure. So.\nPORTEBEN\n15:40 \nQuick question. Sorry, Ricky to cut you off, no.\nRICKY\n15:44 \nYour demo at ask questions?\nPORTEBEN\n15:46 \nYeah. So one problem that we're faced with net exam is that we pay X amount of dollars per user and they don't get an opportunity to trial a course before they, you know, they essentially decide to take out a license. So we find that there's a lot of licenses which are given to users that aren't actually used all they log in once and that's it. So, what I've suggested to net exam until we get a new LMS is to have a landing page with some trial courses. So kind of like a try before you buy, although we're the ones buying the license for them.\nPayment Gateway ends\nPORTEBEN\n16:24 \nIs that possible with you guys to have like say two or three courses that like on the lot similar to like what you've got here that they can click on? We don't need reporting from it. It's more just so that they, we can put some, you know, really enticing and engaging courses there. Then hopefully once they've done that, the learner guys, yeah, I'm actually really interested in this. I'm gonna get my sales rep to sign me up as…\nTIM\n16:48 \nExample.\nRICKY\n16:50 \n100 percent. And that's actually a great use case. So, I mean, at the end of the day, it just depends how you want to walk these down, right? Like I show them to be public facing. Now, there might be… this is something we'd have to discuss about a little later because it might affect how the pricing is, but that's the conversation for later. But just to answer like in terms of, can you do it? Yes. So let's the fact is we're not even signed in yet. So.\nPORTEBEN\n17:17 \nAnd…\nRICKY\n17:18 \nThis was a public website and someone just came to it and this was an E learning course not locked behind pricing. I can technically take this course now though that person would be associated with a monthly active user, if that makes sense. But our clients do that today. If you go to the Zoom website and you go to their learning center and you click some trainings that's actually Docebo. And that's just you going there and taking them. So if you just wanted to have one or two courses here, hey guys, check out a couple of what we can offer 100 percent. You can do that. And that's actually a great way to it's marketing. It's a great way to get people.\nPORTEBEN\n17:49 \nIt is.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Bri discussed the idea of incentivization for veterinary professionals, where they could earn points by learning that could be exchanged for discounts on pet food.\n• Tim clarified that purchase eCommerce would not be required at this point and Ricky discussed how users could trial courses through public websites. \n• Ben proposed creating a \"try before you buy\" landing page in order to entice learners into the program. END"}
{"prompt":"RACHEL\n24:10 \nIt, it does it again, if we're gonna have a global accounts in all these different sub sections of different types of materials. Because what works for one country doesn't work for another. Obviously, exactly. So how do we not have, you know, 15 versions of the same document, right? That is my hope. We have one, we can share it globally. You know, we just have it tagged. So it's obvious about where it should go.\nRICKY\n24:38 \nYeah, I'll hop into the admin side for you, but that's exactly what the central repository is for that like literally what you're just describing.\nPayment Gateway\nRICKY\n24:44 \nAnd the fact that we can do is to mention what we call extend an enterprise which essentially is just a different instance. So right up here, we'll see real can demo a different instance would have a different URL, but still being managed by that central repository. So you can still easily put those courses as long as there are universal courses.\nPayment Gateway ends\nRICKY\n25:01 \nYou know, you can put them into different learning plans for different folks. And then the even bigger advantage on top of that to take it to another level. If you have to do any, you know, version controlling if you have a new version of that course, for example, and you want to update it, it'll update every course that it lives in so that you don't have to go individually into those courses and update that particular course.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n25:28 \nAll right.\nTIM\n25:29 \nIt does, is this coming through with the pages, I think pages is a huge differentiator for Docebo. So I want you to understand that you can really create unique experiences, but you can have all that on the, all of your information sitting in the back end. So you can just push it out to where you feel it's necessary. But the pages help to create that unique experience for each user that comes in. So we can really give that a unique experience. Does that make sense?\nRACHEL\n25:59 \nIt does. And just to make sure I understand because you need to compare it to Cornerstone. This is something that Cornerstone cannot have unique pages.\nLayout & Content ends\nRICKY\n26:09 \nRight. Yeah. I mean, I'm not an expert on Cornerstone but I don't believe them or really anyone can do it as extensively as we can like this. And what I like about this too, it's like when I speak to some folks about LMS is like they have a certain look to them and I'll probably go to another page that will feel a little more LMS.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n26:27 \nBut what I love about what we can do is you can really just create unique landing pages and have that user experience, you know, really nailed down so that folks recognize what they come to. It's easy for them to find what they need to as well. So speaking of that, I will hop over to this one. So this is a little more of your traditional, I guess, yes… here, we have again our not started deadlines as you can see, we have some different widgets here. So, you know, if you wanted to have a banner, if you wanted to have a video, you can do that.\nLayout & Content ends\nRICKY\n27:01 \nIf you, this one, if you wanted to add links to link out to other systems, you can add widgets and have buttons for that as well. This is our course catalog that we put here that maybe this particular learner is in these different catalogs and they can just kinda choose and see the course that they want to enroll themselves into. And I did wanna point out here on the right side. So here we have our badges and our leader boards. This is probably the area when we're talking about points and how do you want to distribute points? And what they wanna use those points for would be in this area. So we also have leader boards if you wanna do some gamification, you know, you don't have to have this stuff here or even have it visible. They can just, you know, kind of receive points on the end. But it is a good way to show some gamification if you want to do that. They can receive badges for maybe different certifications that they have to do. If you guys have your own Royal canine programs that you can certify people on, then they can receive those badges, they could be associated with points as well. And I believe you can associate points with really a lot of different things in areas within the system. I think you can get points for just logging in. You can get points for just doing certain courses. And then with that and see a total points.\nRICKY\n28:14 \nSo this is my badges and points page. So you can see what badges you've completed your leader boards, if there's any contest… rewards. So I'm not on the right page here.\nTIM\n28:25 \nI think trophy is up at the top there. Awesome. Yeah.\nRICKY\n28:30 \nAnd that's what I was looking for. Yeah. So here, you can see individually what you've accomplished and stuff. But I think this is what you guys were talking about. So you're talking about the reward shop. So now you've gotten points, what do they want to do with those points here's? Where if you have those external programs that, you know, allow people to redeem points for specific things. Now you can start creating the page for, okay, I've gotten, I have 5,000 points. I want to get a discount on another course and that's all done natively within Docebo. Okay?\nPORTEBEN\n29:02 \nSo, this can be customized to each market, correct?\nRICKY\n29:07 \nYeah. Yep. Perfect.\nTIM\n29:10 \nSo if you want, if you want to have this. So this way your clinics, maybe within your clinics, you can drive, you know, some competition there or if you want and you can do like a leader board that's for the, you know, for the whole retail account, things like that, that's how you can really get this thing to hone in and hit home a little bit for them.\nRACHEL\n29:34 \nBut that would be lovely.\nRICKY\n29:38 \nYou can see like, I mean, you can really customize it to however type of reward you want to provide. So we're like kind of the vehicle in between. And if you have that other program that's actually going to provide them with that discount, this can link you out to that particular program. And so also give you, I mean, go ahead.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rachel expressed her hope of having one global document that is tagged and shareable, which Ricky noted can be managed by a central repository.\n• Porteben asked if the rewards could be customized to each market, which Ricky confirmed. \n• Tim suggested leveraging leaderboards per clinic or on a retail level, which Rachel said would be lovely.

{"prompt":"RACHEL\n29:55 \nYou know, if say we have Zoom integrated and I'm not sure what that your platform looks like for running webinars, but assuming that there's like chat and Q and a functions to that. Any of those are point based. I know that's in the weeds.\nRICKY\n30:17 \nWhen we do the Webinar or the ILT S as we call them like Instructor led training or virtual Instructor led training. We do have a native integration with Zoom, but essentially, what's happening is you're able to open Zoom within Docebo. And then it kinda takes you to Zoom, so.\nRACHEL\n30:33 \nStraight to Zoom.\nRICKY\n30:36 \nI think depending what the course is, I think you can associate points for them having taking that course, right?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRICKY\n30:42 \nBecause it still gets reported that they've taken the course. Does that make sense or a you thinking points for like interactivity and folks like?\nRACHEL\n30:49 \nJust because we…\nBRI\n30:50 \nThe activity? Yeah.\nPORTEBEN\n30:52 \nFor…\nRACHEL\n30:53 \nJust, I also…\nPORTEBEN\n30:55 \nWork.\nRACHEL\n30:56 \nWith like seven seven also has gamification, but like say Zoom is built into sort of the more the native system. And if someone ask a question, they'll get we'll sign amount of points to it here's, 20 points, right? For interacting with us, right? So.\nRICKY\n31:11 \nGot it. So, depending on who the Instructor is, because I'm pretty sure that managers can assign points and badges yep. So you can do that. So if you have an Instructor who, you know, is taking notes, they can, yeah, I'll give you like the, I like the.\nRACHEL\n31:26 \nBut on the back end, but on the back end that?\nTIM\n31:30 \nYeah.\nRICKY\n31:30 \nYeah.\nRICKY\n31:34 \nAny other questions will?\nTIM\n31:35 \nNo, we'll have to put that in.\nRICKY\n31:39 \nYeah, no, that's it's a great question.\nUser Permission\nRICKY\n31:41 \nBut yeah, I believe that the Instructor should be able to or whoever is the Power user or the admin will get into later. We'll be able to assign some points. Awesome. And just from a visualization standpoint, like I know that I clicked up here to go to reward shop.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n31:56 \nBut just to kinda show you the flexibility of the pages, if you wanted to have like a widget with a button with a nice picture, say click here to go to the reward shop. Just another great way you can, you know, Jazz up the page as well and just make it easy for the user.\nLearning Plans\nRICKY\n32:09 \nAwesome. So what I'll do here is I'll hop in here, getting started. So this is just an example of a learning plan. This is kind of top of the hierarchy. You have a learning plan within the learning plan. You have your courses within the courses, you have your E called learning material or learning object. This could be obviously a mix. So maybe this particular learning plan has an E learning course. It has an ILT course and it has a locked course. So essentially, all that means is that you have to take two courses before you can take this course. So it gives you a lot of a lot of functionality there. If you want to lock down some courses or have prerequisites put in place, folks will always start where they left off, which is nice. A nice little UI perspective and let them know how much more they have to complete. And then you obviously, you have a full back end, you know, flexibility over the learning plan.\nCertifications\nRICKY\n32:59 \nLike what does percentage mean? If you want two courses to complete the course? If you need all three, that's completely up to you. So you have all that flexibility as.\nRACHEL\n33:09 \nSo assuming they complete a course and there's a certificate attached to that course. Would they see it here where they see it on their personal page where…\nRICKY\n33:21 \nThey have both, they have two there's two ways you can do it. They'll have a transcript and they'll be able to see… everything that they've done essentially their full transcript, what they have to do, what they've completed, what they have overdue and you can have Notifications with that as well, the certificates that they've received, maybe the re, certifying that they need to do as well. They'll be able to see all of that in their own personal.\nTIM\n33:50 \nWe'll show you that in a minute.\nRICKY\n33:51 \nScript, yeah.\nTIM\n33:52 \nWe'll get there in just a minute, so that's where you can see.\nRICKY\n33:54 \nRight there. And my activity, I do it right now. Is it my activities? Yeah. Yeah. So managers have access to this as well as the individual learner. So, the statistics, what I've done, my certifications, basically what I've completed, what I need to renew. It just makes it a lot easier for them to see what they have to do. So, if they have like yearly training that they need to do or a certificate, or maybe you've updated a certificate and they need to redo it, they'll be able to see that there.\nTIM\n34:24 \nOf courses if I could.\nRACHEL\n34:26 \nOkay. But if they…\nTIM\n34:29 \nWe have.\nRACHEL\n34:30 \nCourses where we need actual, you know, something, they can print out certificate from the course.\nRICKY\n34:35 \nYeah. Yeah. They'll get the fall like you can.\nRACHEL\n34:37 \nYou can do all the things.\nRICKY\n34:40 \nLike you can fully create that certificate. We have social, they can share this on their LinkedIn in what people love doing that social linking out and stuff and you can.\nCertifications ends\nTIM\n34:51 \nCustomize this. Yeah, you wanted to fit what you like. It's not gonna see a one there obviously.\nRICKY\n34:59 \nIt could, doesn't have to, but it could, yeah. Does that answer your question?\nRACHEL\n35:07 \nIt does. It does cause tracking of certificates is a big deal for us in North America.\nRICKY\n35:14 \nYeah.\nCustom Reports\nRICKY\n35:16 \nAnd I mean you can have full reports. So like this certification here from a manager perspective, like they have reports that will say who needs to renew them or who's overdue and stuff like that. So from both front end back end and then our notification center is really great too.\nNotifications\nRICKY\n35:31 \nOur Notifications completely event based within the platform and there's over like I wanna say over 120 events which can include something as easy as, hey, you got three weeks to complete this training. You got to complete this training today. You got to complete this training yesterday, like you can set those all up as Notifications.\nCertifications\nRICKY\n35:48 \nSo yeah, very flexible and ensuring that folks are always up to date and what they need to be up to date with.\nRACHEL\n35:54 \nOkay. So, sorry, I, I'm always off into the weeds. I love this. So, so again, for veteran technicians and vets, they have to have in a certain amount of continue education hours per year, which is where the certificates come in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rachel asked about integrations with Zoom, points and badges associated with interactivity on their platform, user permissions and customizing layout and content. END"}
{"prompt":"RACHEL\n36:17 \nAnd if we have those, our live events. So Instructor led. So I know with the integration of Zoom, how are those tracked, right? Who's registering? Who actually shows up, right? Attendees? Because we needed to… know exactly who's you know, do they show up and turn it back off? Have they been there for 50 minutes, right?\nRICKY\n36:45 \nDefinitely a couple of ways you can do that. You can kind of almost gamified if you will as well. So I mean, of course, you'll have full reporting. So this is an ILT… they click into it. This is happens to be in person for example. So you can even put a map and show them where it is. Give them all that information and details, what the sessions look like. So if I click on session one, and right here, you'll see custom tool. So if you have it… if they, if you have your Zoom, like ready to go. And that's where you're using and it's integrated. This is where you'll see that Zoom link and it's gonna be to that specific Instructor, for example, so they can have their Zoom there.\nRACHEL\n37:27 \nOkay. So, so it is Zoom through us and not something that you have.\nRICKY\n37:32 \nYeah, it'll be your Zoom exactly. Yeah. So there's a couple of ways you can track attendance.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRICKY\n37:38 \nI mean, the reporting will show that obviously the person is here now, is it gonna because it goes into the Zoom? Is it gonna show, you know, how they, they've logged in and then they've left in 10 minutes that I don't believe so. But here you can have content. So what's great about this one is that you can put some pre content down. So for example, if you have some reading they wanna do before they go into the session so that they can be prepared, you can add it here, course surveys. Potentially, you have a post course survey and that's not optional that they have to take. And these are just little ways, you know, that they've been there that they've interacted that they've participated or one that they were there like the post survey can literally be like acknowledge that you are here type thing. So there's different ways you can go about doing that.\nRACHEL\n38:28 \nSo, so I guess my quick interpretation is… you do not get reporting back of attendees directly from Zoom.\nCourse Enrollment\nRACHEL\n38:38 \nWe'd have to have some sort of work around to track that built in.\nTIM\n38:45 \nThere's a couple of different ways you can do that. And the fact that you can have the Instructor… a test to that you can have it so that this way if they actually log in to the Zoom, that can be one.\nCertifications\nTIM\n38:59 \nObviously, that's probably not what you want. You can have where it takes attendance, where the end of course attestation doesn't unlock until the end of the course. And then this way, you know, that where they have to take a certain test. So there's a lot of different ways. Now, what you're asking I believe is statistics from the actual Zoom on how long they've been on there, correct?\nCourse Enrollment\nRACHEL\n39:27 \nYeah. It's not a requirement or at least they're not tracking it currently, but say, if we have an hour long course, you know, can we confirm that this person was there for 40 minutes of it? At least?\nTIM\n39:41 \nThat's coming down the pipe for Zoom. It's that's really a Zoom limitation that it is us.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nTIM\n39:47 \nSo, but I do know we are a partner with Zoom and obviously they're a large customer of ours. That is something that they're working on for this exact purpose. So in the meantime, there are different ways that you can do that. So this way you can wait for completions or you can have it. So this way there's a, you know, the couple of different ways that I explained in the fact that you can make it so that the Instructor designates that they've completed it, but they have to take a test at the end or serve at the end or you can have it that they log in.\nCourse Enrollment\nTIM\n40:21 \nTheir mark is completion. So there's different ways to do that as well. Does that, I mean, in the meantime, does that help you with what you're trying to go?\nRACHEL\n40:32 \nThe short answer is no.\nPORTEBEN\n40:36 \nWe can definitely get that reporting from Zoom because we've already looked at it. It's just that, yeah, at the moment, it sounds like we would have to essentially.\nBRI\n40:48 \nYeah. It might be something that we need to use like, I know, I don't know if you guys still work with guy cat or whatnot, but as far as like getting the system up and going, because right now, librix has a report that when Zoom reports back in that they were there or that they activated the link, they've built in like a timer in like libric. So there there is something that can be done. It's just not… out of the box. And then I do know that I got a notice. I think this summer, it might be coming the Zoom that you can put in the requirement for webinaring? Yep.\nRACHEL\n41:28 \nI'm trying to have minimal back end admin.\nPORTEBEN\n41:33 \nYeah, which is downloading…\nRACHEL\n41:35 \nLoading attendees from Zoom and then trying to match them up to who is registered on the LMS system. And then clicking through, right? That makes me sad.\nBRI\n41:46 \nYeah.\nRICKY\n41:48 \nNo, I got, I understand. I'm actually taking note here and I'm gonna see on the back end kind of where we are with that… if that is coming down soon because the thing I just want to know because like when you're putting in the custom tool here, it's not like the Zoom button. This is any custom tool really that you're putting. So it could be teams could be citrix or something like that. So, I'll see kind of where we are on that recording, but I think right now we don't pull that reporting.\nRACHEL\n42:15 \nOkay.\nRICKY\n42:18 \nOkay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ricky and Bri discussed ways to track attendance of live events, such as Zoom. \n END"}
{"prompt":"RACHEL\n42:19 \nAnd, and I guess also looking at this is also set up for somewhat in person, right?\nRICKY\n42:26 \nYeah. So this was, it originally used to be two, it used to be in person and, or virtual and we've actually since combined it. Like if it's not in person, you don't have to have any of these details here. This was just kind of built out to be both, but it could be strictly just the virtual event.\nRACHEL\n42:40 \nOkay. So it could be virtual, it could be hybrid, it could be in person, exactly.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRACHEL\n42:45 \nOkay. And I guess also circling back to the check in process that is just, is there an app linked to this? Is there… again looking at if this is in person, do they have to just be an admin or be in the Instructor? Pull up the website and check people in that way? Or what does that look like?\nRICKY\n43:10 \nSo, you're talking about like checking in from a learner perspective? Yeah, I think well because it's they're there because they have to register for it, right? Registering for it. And now you're asking like are they actually there?\nRACHEL\n43:23 \nAre they actually there? And then, how do we track that in person?\nRICKY\n43:28 \nThe best part about that would probably be creating something for them to actually show that they've been there. Okay? Is one because I know what you're saying, it's one thing to register now that they actually go to it, right?\nRACHEL\n43:39 \nYep.\nRICKY\n43:40 \nYou can put a check in place and it could be, yeah, I know we have it called survey, but it can literally just be checking like if you just want people to check in, like you can just create that.\nCourse Enrollment\nRICKY\n43:50 \nOkay… right? Cool. Any more questions while we're here on the ILT, do you guys do a lot of kind of virtual ILT sessions?\nRACHEL\n44:01 \nA lot? Yes.\nPORTEBEN\n44:03 \nYep. Lots of them.\nRICKY\n44:05 \nWhat's the, what's the frequency? Like I'm just curious like would you be spending more time on that? Do you think or on E learning courses or you looking at kind of like a balance?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRACHEL\n44:14 \nA balance between the two?\nPORTEBEN\n44:16 \nOkay. Yeah, definitely. I agree. At the moment, we're more centered around actual traditional E learnings, but we're moving towards, yeah, more of a hybrid where it's a combination of both. Yeah.\nRICKY\n44:34 \nGot it. Okay. No, that's super helpful. So… we can certainly spend more sessions and my colleagues name is Scott.\nCourse Enrollment\nRICKY\n44:44 \nSo I'll just keep throwing Scott out there. So you don't so, you know what I'm talking about, but when we can certainly do more sessions of diving into exactly how to kinda set these up or what you guys are looking for when you guys are doing live sessions, are the, these are these folks that are self registering?\nCourse Enrollment ends\nRACHEL\n45:02 \nFor North America? Yes?\nPORTEBEN\n45:05 \nAnd same with global.\nRICKY\n45:07 \nGot it. So if I go to let's see, do I have it here? I wanna make sure I'm in course catalog. So this is, I'm just kind of browsing around pages and just, we just have some pre rendered pages so that you guys can just have an idea. And I think this got changed. So is it here? Yeah, I think we, I think we change this up a little bit for you guys. So it's not the page I was looking for. So essentially, we have a widget that is a course catalog essentially like that, maybe we have it in the learner dashboard.\nCourse Enrollment\nRICKY\n45:50 \nAnd what it does is it shows you any upcoming courses or ILT, whether it's in a card form like this with all the information including the date and the information on the course itself. And then there's also the option to look at it from a calendar view. So you have the two options if you want to even just get rid of this and have that calendar as like a front page because that's important for your learners to come in and see what upcoming events there are. There's a widget that will show them in those two different views so that they can just self register to them.\nRACHEL\n46:25 \nThat's it, that would be helpful for us.\nRICKY\n46:29 \nAnd that's a course catalog calendar. This is the personal calendar. So if they go and self register to one of those, it'll come up on their personal calendar and then they can see what they have coming up.\nLearning Plans\nRICKY\n46:41 \nSo both those options are there. And I thought I had it here but I guess we do not. So I'll just go back here. I'll go back to getting started and I'll hop into the E learning course. So we did the ILT, I'll hop into the E learning to kinda give you an idea of the course player and how this is set up. So it's very YouTube. Like the idea is that, you know, someone comes in here and, you know, they already kind of know what to do, where they click on. This is the course player. Again, if someone's already started something, they can resume where they've left off. They can just immediately start learning.\nLearning Plans ends\nRICKY\n47:14 \nNow if they want to go and order… this is where the training material lives within the course. Now, we've broken this down into module one, module, two evaluations, that just to give you an idea that you can do that. Typically, sometimes we'll just see one training material in the course and maybe it's a scorm file. For example, this is just to give you an idea of the different file types that we have, which is all the file types. Essentially. If you want to put in a powerpoint, we have the slide converter here. So you can simply just have folks go through the powerpoint.\nCertifications\nRICKY\n47:50 \nThis does get reported on by the way. So if you want to see, you know, how far folks have gone if they've completed it and it won't show complete until, you know, of course, they go to the end of the last slide and then you'll see that little check mark that they've completed it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rachael and Ricky discussed options for course enrollment, virtual or in-person.\n• They discussed the possibility of creating a check-in process to track in-person attendance.\n END"}
{"prompt":"RICKY\n54:03 \nNew technology could always be a little terrifying. You never know what people are gonna do with it, but it's…\nRACHEL\n54:08 \nWhat they might record and send in. So.\nRICKY\n54:11 \nFor sure, for sure, there's always, I guess a little bit of risk with that, but the reward is it's great. I guess at the same time.\nBRI\n54:19 \nI mean spice it up with legal. This person just send us a video of fill in.\nRICKY\n54:24 \nThere you go. And maybe a bunch of cat videos.

Any questions on this or even thoughts of how it looks?\nRICKY\n54:56 \nThis can go full screen if they need to, you can add it to your playlist and you can even social share.

I know that we got five minutes here. I'm gonna save the admin side for a second session. I think that would make sense with Scott to go on the admin side. It's a little more… I guess, yeah, he's probably better at it than I am, but I do want to show you one thing actually.\nBranches & Groups\nRICKY\n55:28 \nAnd this is something that I did pretty quickly. How do you set it up? How do you manage your users? And this is really what drives the entire platform. How do you know that person's from coming in or that is in the France region or they're in the USA region or the, or what part of the USA or what… that, who they are essentially. So you can user management. This is called Branches with in Docebo. Typically, how Branches work is that they mimic your hierarchy, think of it from an let's think of it from an internal perspective. First your Workday hierarchy, what we would do is we would just mimic how that is built out and bringing into Docebo. Everyone is kind of one to one to a branch. And then I'll show you a little in two seconds, how we do groups, but think of Branches as your hierarchy. So if I just clicked on internal, you got me North America and then you can really just drill down to however these are labels that can be changed.\nAbout Docebo\nRICKY\n56:35 \nMaybe it's Canada, maybe it's Toronto and we have these obviously as locations, but it could be sales account executives, business development reps, and you can just kinda keep going down those Branches… here's where it gets really interesting for us though. Is that how easy we allow you to work with external folks?\nBranches & Groups\nRICKY\n56:59 \nSo in the same way that internal built, maybe you have partners, maybe you have work with shelters or as hope I spelt that, right? And if you click on that nice distributor here, but like however you want to build out that hierarchy or however it's built out currently in maybe your partner management system or your CRM or something that can come and mimic here.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n57:23 \nAnd with this now, you can easily start personalizing it to these specific Branches in how, you know, they're going to interact with the LMS, what pages they're gonna see this is where you can start driving that engine of personalization within the platform.\nRACHEL\n57:38 \nSo talking about linking it to CRMS, what does that look like with Salesforce?\nLayout & Content ends\nRACHEL\n57:46 \nIs this, you know, we have a list of people and we upload it or is this sort of we can push either direction or?\nTIM\n57:57 \nHow do you want?\nRACHEL\n57:59 \nI would love for it to… essentially sync with Salesforce. So, so we have a user logs in from abc clinic.\nIntegrations\nRACHEL\n58:14 \nThey log in. It is like it connects with Salesforce, auto, fills in all their information. They just confirm this looks correct, right? And then off they go. And then all that reporting is now tied into Salesforce about what sort of… whatever they happen to do and click on and learn is now pushed to Salesforce. So it's sort that by bidirectional back and forth, which makes us really happy. And if we could have a single sign on, right? No, all those sorts of things because we, I've run into, you know, we just get that we can do the upload, and then we can push new people. But then we don't get that the pool again from Salesforce, right? Like, yeah, well, here's all the new people in Salesforce, right? So then those people get lost.\nRICKY\n59:11 \nYeah, no. So we can absolutely do that. We do have integrations with Salesforce at a certain point throughout our journey. We'll I'll bring in our solution architect to have that conversation maybe with some of your it folks or Salesforce admin to understand exactly what's needed from your perspective because it just depends like we have open API. So essentially, I don't like to say anything's possible, but like however it needs to be built, we'll just have them kinda sit down with you. And to get that understanding of what needs to… what information needs to be passed. Sometimes it's just basic information like this users and fields. Maybe you need completion data, other that pass back and forth as well. So we do have a lot of, a lot of customers leveraging that.\nRACHEL\n59:57 \nDefinitely, we need that back and forth because otherwise, yeah, again.\nRICKY\n1:00:00 \nIs Salesforce the only system that you are currently using?\nRACHEL\n1:00:04 \nFor North America, it's a major one.\nRICKY\n1:00:10 \nDoes the customer use Salesforce as well? Or is that just for your person?\nRACHEL\n1:00:14 \nThat is just for us.

So, so to sell is what you use for the rest of the?\nPORTEBEN\n1:01:14 \nYeah. So, so currently, while previously I should say markets could have various different CRM platforms and I think it was two years ago, there was a decision globally that all our C markets will eventually be on set to sell.

So whereas Branches was one to one, this could be one too many. You can have one person in numerous groups depending on what it is, what their role is, the location or things like that. And you can start feeding out, you know, specific learning or courses easily to a group.\nLearning Plans\nRICKY\n1:03:07 \nSo think of it of like I know this group needs to take this in your learning plan when you add users to that course curriculum. Essentially, you're just choosing those groups thus making it a lot easier from an admin perspective as well. So here, we have a couple of examples like customer success.\nBranches & Groups\nRICKY\n1:03:25 \nI have the eligibility. So essentially you create your group, what however you wanna name it, what the description is… remove deactivated users just gives you some options. But essentially the eligibility, this is where it's gonna how you satisfy the group. I just click a new set. And essentially like there's a lot of conditions here that you can add. I think there's more. All conditions must be satisfied. At least one condition must be satisfied. So just gives you a lot of options. And the reason why I'm showing you this is because people can be automatically enrolled into groups. So depending on the conditions that you've set, if those folks KS come from Salesforce, and they meet the conditions of the group, they'll be put into that group. Once they're put in that group, maybe you have some onboarding or specific courses that they now have to take which they can be automatically enrolled in. Really the whole idea is really automating the whole system as much as you can, right? Less admin work, but also just flowing it more efficiently. So it really gives you a lot of ability to automate the system and personalize it as much as much as possible. So those are the two different user management. I'm gonna say groups, but yeah, to user management groups that we have any questions on groups in compared to the Branches.\nCustom Reports\nRICKY\n1:04:59 \nIt makes sense.\nTIM\n1:05:02 \nReally get creative here.\nRICKY\n1:05:04 \nYeah, I can get really granular. We've seen people with a lot of pretty granular groups and.\nPORTEBEN\n1:05:11 \nYeah, we previously had the ability, what we call them user types within that exam. We previously had the ability for markets to choose as many as they wanted, and it got out of hand. So we actually from a global level said that they have to fit within. There were 16 user types, but now there's 17 to try and prevent. Yeah, it just basically getting out of getting out of hand particularly from reporting because then there was no consistency with reporting. So, yeah, we try it relatively streamlined.\nBranches & Groups\nRACHEL\n1:05:47 \nSo, I guess that brings up the us does have different groups of clinics, right? We have all the band field Linux. What would, I guess? I mean? It was a question for Ben and I, what would that mean? You know, to set up… whatever group or whatever that looks?\nBranches & Groups ends\nPORTEBEN\n1:06:08 \nWell, yeah.\nBRI\n1:06:09 \nWe went through when we were trying to build our instance of net exam. So, yeah.\nRACHEL\n1:06:14 \nThanks.\nBRI\n1:06:15 \nFor asking.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rachel asked about the ability to track a user through link abc, have integrations with Salesforce and match users in Salesforce.\n• Ben mentioned that there was a decision globally that all markets should move to Salesforce and within the next year and a half, all markets will have set to sell.

{"prompt":"RICKY\n1:12:35 \nYeah, I think that's a little more of a road map. But I was talking to Tim before this. I know that future proofing is big for you guys and understanding road mapping. One session we do wanna put on soon is actually to have maybe like a road mapping session with you if that would make sense for you guys, we're happy to bring in like a product manager to kinda go through that.\nRACHEL\n1:12:55 \nYeah, because they're like in instead of a search term, a search question, right?\nRICKY\n1:13:01 \nA…\nRACHEL\n1:13:02 \nA phrase and actually gets results that's more that's specific for it versus Gi diets and we end up with, you know, 200 things that come up. And now there's they're sorting through all the things which is why I was asking the questions I was before, so.\nRICKY\n1:13:15 \nGreat question. And I'm absolutely certain that that's going to be the future. I have no doubt that that's gonna be everywhere. The interesting thing about Jack GP T, is it only goes up to 2021, I believe, right?\nRACHEL\n1:13:27 \nThat is correct. Yep. So, so nothing recent.\nRICKY\n1:13:31 \nYeah, that'll be interesting. Getting that technology into something like this or really any platform and that now we'll be now will be fine. That'll be great addition to really anything. I wouldn't even know if I'm talking to a robot anymore at one point.\nPORTEBEN\n1:13:46 \nIt is scary.\nTIM\n1:13:49 \nFun fact is actually a rowbot.\nRICKY\n1:13:52 \nNo direction of chat.\nTIM\n1:13:55 \nI'm…\nRICKY\n1:13:56 \nI'm just on the couch watching TV as this is going.\nRACHEL\n1:14:00 \nThat.\nRICKY\n1:14:01 \nMight be the future, but I know that we're a little over time here, guys. I do want to set up the next session as I said, so we got Power users to go over it. We do have reporting to go over discovery coach and share is a lot of stuff. I really appreciate you guys taking the time and sitting through this with me. I know Scott does a way better job. So you're in for a treat next time. You don't have to sit through me doing this again.\nPORTEBEN\n1:14:21 \nThat's great quick question regarding the help section at the top and I know you just close the screen but is that something which we can have like a customized area, say for faqs or… how does that work?\nRICKY\n1:14:38 \nSo, do you mean like kind of up here?\nPORTEBEN\n1:14:40 \nYeah, yup. On the left. You've got the question mark which I presume help is.\nRICKY\n1:14:45 \nYeah, yeah. This kinda shows you… the help around here. So you're essentially you're thinking of just adding a button to bring to another page.\nPORTEBEN\n1:14:55 \nIt's got a whole heap of fic us in that we always.\nRICKY\n1:14:59 \nHave an F, like you have an faq page?\nPORTEBEN\n1:15:02 \nYeah, we do.\nRICKY\n1:15:04 \nYeah. Interestingly enough, there's a few ways people kinda gamify the search. I've actually seen people say like search for a specific term and it brings up the faq because they tagged it that's one way to do it, changing anything on the page. I'm pretty sure it's doable. It's just more of a CSS at that point where you can add in buttons. I can confirm that, but I believe you can do that.\nPORTEBEN\n1:15:27 \nBecause it's just something which we find that key users get inundated for questions which to me are really self intuitive in answering.\nRICKY\n1:15:38 \nOn the front page, but put an faq widget exactly. So this button go to the faq. You can.\nPORTEBEN\n1:15:44 \nI said be something which is really painful and we get a lot of feedback going. Can we have an F a T widget or something that's there to make this process easier? So that's great.\nRICKY\n1:15:56 \nYeah. I used to work in with an AI chat but back in the day back in the it's called like five, six years ago.\nTIM\n1:16:03 \nAnd…\nRICKY\n1:16:04 \nEssentially, it was a, it was a dynamic faq, so people ask questions and they receive the answer, not just an faq page. So I know the types of questions people ask that's cool, but I totally understand you.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n1:16:18 \nBut that's what's great about Docebo pages you just asked, you know, can we put an faq, this reporting hub like pretend this is the learner side? This could just be faq center, yeah, section like you can make that there easily without even CSS. So you can just make the button so that's a great question.\nLayout & Content ends\nRICKY\n1:16:34 \nAnd it's obviously, it's a great idea because if you guys are working externally, it's a little different than just internal, right? So you wanna make you want the least amount of clicks for people to get all the info they need. If that includes, you know, answering questions, it's probably a big one.\nPORTEBEN\n1:16:47 \nSure. And one more thing and it's fine because Rachel and I are in a meeting together anyway at the moment. Technically. So just a quick thing and you don't have to answer it. Now could be something that we address, say next time, but we're looking at consolidating digital learning across the ecosystem. And one large component that is there is the, is what we call that focus. So that focus is basically its own entity that has scientific articles and practice management articles for veterinarians. Now, previously access was closed and they had to register, but now it's open access essentially. But they have a lot of problems with the program that they use. And there's discussion to basically allow the focus to become part of the Royal can academy or whatever we call it down? I will have a name change. Would that be something that we do with the home page that you showed before to have access to those articles? Or is that something that we can build into the system that can redirect so that it is open access. How would that potentially work? So you can do both? Is it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ben raised the possibility of consolidating digital learning across the ecosystem, including focus, which currently has open access but could potentially be part of Royal Can Academy.

{"prompt":"RICKY\n1:18:11 \nIts own platform? Would you be linking out to another platform?\nPORTEBEN\n1:18:14 \nWe would look at no getting rid of that platform because we think that we have a lot of problems with net exam, the number of problems that they have like sometimes about what you do. So they're looking at completely getting rid of it. How?\nRICKY\n1:18:29 \nIs it set up via just like a bunch of articles or?\nPORTEBEN\n1:18:32 \nYeah, I can actually put the link in so that way you guys can have a look at it. But essentially, I'm just.\nRICKY\n1:18:39 \nTo think of how you would like it to be set up because.\nPORTEBEN\n1:18:42 \nYeah, I'll show you. And again, you don't need to do this now, but essentially, it's something that I definitely want to talk about in future, but I've just put the link to it within the chat. So at the moment, it just looks like a web page with different options at the top. And you can say that that's scientific practice management, the issues where they can go into the actual articles that symposium, which is a live event that we do every year. And then a little bit about the authors and that focus.\nRICKY\n1:19:15 \nGot it. Okay. So this could, so this is just set up. Is this is a different platform?\nPORTEBEN\n1:19:24 \nCorrect. Yep.\nRACHEL\n1:19:26 \nI sorta wonder if it could be set up almost like we would have the us section. We'd have the bet focused section and then…\nPORTEBEN\n1:19:32 \nHave…\nRACHEL\n1:19:32 \nAll the articles available for everyone to put directly into their country as well. So almost have two ways to get the information.\nPORTEBEN\n1:19:41 \nYeah, because the main thing is that part, it's at least available as open access. So you don't need to have a user… license in order to access it previously, it was fine because it was closed but yeah, it's something which like this educational content is amazing. They have a phenomenal number of users.\nRICKY\n1:20:05 \nThis looks really.\nPORTEBEN\n1:20:06 \nGood. And certainly, you can see now that there's a warning previously, it was closed because a lot of the articles contain sensitive material. But now our legals kind of reviewed it and said actually there's only a few articles that we have to keep closed. The rest can be open with a little warning just saying there's graphic content in there, but yeah, it's something we would love to pull these articles across to say… our educational offering with you.\nRICKY\n1:20:39 \nBut my answer is yes, it just really depends on how you want it to be set up and visible for them. So essentially, like within our LMS, you know, each article would have to essentially be like I say course and quotations, but it could be an article, but you see how we have it broken up like that would be, it would match your scientific, your place. This obviously looks nice. It's a website, but if you're looking to have it more organized and kind of this way, then you would have the articles here for scientific and so forth. But, and like obviously this is just the front page with catalogs, you can create, you know, a nice looking page specific to that and have a button on the front page that takes them to it.\nPORTEBEN\n1:21:21 \nYeah.\nRICKY\n1:21:22 \nIf that's how you want to do. So like it's definitely doable. I just, I guess you would just have to understand how are these articles being kept? Yep, how you would like them to present within this? And the course player might not be as aesthetically pleasing as reading is something like this is easier, but… it's certainly doable.\nLayout & Content\nRICKY\n1:21:45 \nIt's just a matter of like we just have to kinda sit down with your vision. But again, I'm just gonna always reiterate our pages. It's that because you can create these kinds of nice, custom, yeah, home pages, you can again, you can have your faq widget, you can have your articles widget, and this can take that user to a specifically branded page to this. Yep. So it's…\nCoach & Share\nTIM\n1:22:12 \nChannels too, you know, there could be channels for specific, you know, for nurses for, you know, certain, you know, for French bulldogs or whatever, you know, you can create so many different channels that they can follow and then also search for as well.\nPORTEBEN\n1:22:29 \nThat's great. I just wanted to float the idea because I know that we will bring the person that's responsible for that focus into the discussion later down the track.\nCoach & Share ends\nPORTEBEN\n1:22:37 \nBut I just wanted to see that it's definitely the case that we can do that which is great. And then you just said something and I had a question and my coffee obviously hasn't kicked in yet because I've forgotten it. That doesn't matter. I'll remember it. You watch it like two am tomorrow morning. No, this is great. Thank you. Really that's right? So are we able to integrate this with Octa? So that we have single sign on?\nRICKY\n1:23:10 \nAt this first page depending on who the user is, if they're in your Octa, they wouldn't even see this page, they can potentially just go right into it.\nIntegrations\nPORTEBEN\n1:23:19 \nLove it. Love it. Thank you.\nRICKY\n1:23:21 \nYeah, yep, absolutely. Our most common integration.\nPORTEBEN\n1:23:25 \nYeah, because we integrated to, with net exam and it was meant to be something which was make meant to make life easier and it's just turned into a year of a nightmare. So, yeah, that's…\nRICKY\n1:23:38 \nWeird integrations keep in mind with.\nTIM\n1:23:41 \nUse Octa.\nRICKY\n1:23:42 \nYeah, we use Octa for sure. One thing with us and this is something I am pretty confident in saying our integrations is probably the best in class in terms of how we're rated in terms of how we can integrate with HRIS systems, single sign on systems. We are, we're a third party notably rated quite high, yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ricky and Ben discussed transitioning away from the current platform to a more organized system for their educational offering.\n• Ben noted legal review of open access material with some articles requiring a warning of sensitive content.\n• Integrating Okta for single sign on was discussed, as the current integration has been difficult.\n END"}

That wasn't on our last call so far? I don't see any new faces. Is there anyone else joining?\nCHRIS\n1:21 \nI think this is everyone.\nCAROLINE\n1:23 \nOkay, awesome. Sounds good. Well, I was just listening back to our last demo. And really what we had kind of decided on for today is, you know, now that you've gone through the demo, I know we threw a lot at you and I sent over the recording. I'm curious to hear kind of what conversations came up as you were debriefing as a team, what questions came up?\nOnboarding\nCAROLINE\n1:50 \nSo we can spend some time just really chatting through that, making sure that you're comfortable with everything. And then I think we can shift our focus to an area where I think most of the questions will be focused is kind of around that validation. So, you all met Chris last time when we did the demo.\nIntegrations\nCAROLINE\n2:10 \nWe've also brought on John, who is a solutions architect here at Docebo and goes a little bit deeper into the technical side of things. So, where my mind was going with bringing John on is around kind of the eCommerce questions and how people register for courses and any integrations that you're looking to accomplish.\nIntegrations ends\nCAROLINE\n2:33 \nAnd then I've also prepared some slides around pricing and onboarding, if we have time. So those are kind of like the three buckets that I was thinking we'd cover today. Is that what you were hoping to take off?\nREBECCA\n2:46 \nI know as a group, we all came together and just put some questions down about what can be done. So, I go through some of those two, and however you?\nCAROLINE\n2:56 \nYeah, yeah. Why don't we start with that? I'd love to hear what conversations were had once after the demo.\nREBECCA\n3:04 \nOkay. So this is all over the place. So I didn't category. All right. So, one of the things that we're looking at is just the internal user management that we have.\nUser Permission\nREBECCA\n3:17 \nSo we would manage a lot of the users from SQL, but we would also potentially want to give people a level of permission, like maybe it's a state representative, maybe it's a state director where they can go in and look at specific learners that are assigned for them. What does that look like? And then can they delete and add users? And like what kind of Permissions does that look like?\nCHRIS\n3:43 \nThat's a really?\nCAROLINE\n3:44 \nQuestion?\nCHRIS\n3:45 \nSo the shorter answer is we have that middle tier user we call the Power user and that's all based on Permissions and we build those Permissions in different profiles. Those profiles can be for one particular task or for several. And they can be matched. Stacked. However it might really look for your organization as an example. You know, we'll have customers that have branch level managers, but then they have those regional or director managers above them and they have all the same access plus a little more or a little less however you want to set that up, whether or not they can delete people… against off of Permissions. John, I don't know that we've given that particularly to Power users.\nJONATHAN\n4:38 \nNot managers, but yeah, Power users, you could assign that to a Power user profile. So very granular permission setting in that case. So if you want a certain subset of users to have that permission, you can assign that and then they'd be able to delete them from user management?\nREBECCA\n4:56 \nSo with that Power user, could we limit the things that they could look at or change? So, you know, that Power user. Okay?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Caroline and Rebecca discussed Rebecca's niece and nephews.\n• Jonathan joined the conversation to discuss eCommerce questions, integrations, pricing, and onboarding.\n• Chris addressed user management by introducing the concept of Power users and their associated permissions.\n• John provided further information as to how granular permission settings could be assigned to Power users, such as being able to delete users from a user management page.

{"prompt":"CAROLINE\n5:04 \nAll right. And Rebecca, I'll just, I'll tell you just for kind of your own confidence, the question that you ask and the way that you described it is exactly what Power users were built for.\nUser Permission ends\nCAROLINE\n5:18 \nSo like kudos to you and thinking about those questions, I just want to call that out because we talked to a lot of people and I know this is kinda your first more robust LMS and people don't always get it. And so kudos to you and the team on kind of like hashing out those questions, this is exactly what it's built for.\nREBECCA\n5:40 \nI'll say that's all set because he is very analytical about things. So.\nCAROLINE\n5:45 \nLove it. Love it. Kudos to set.\nSETH\n5:49 \nThat's a nice way to say annoying, but thank you.\nREBECCA\n5:51 \nNo.\nCAROLINE\n5:54 \nAnalytical, annoying kind of.\nCHRIS\n5:57 \nIt's either.\nSETH\n5:58 \nIn…\nREBECCA\n6:02 \nDid you, does that answer everything for you stuff? I don't know if you're good with me, move into the next press?\nPayment Gateway\nSETH\n6:09 \nSo, I think it does. Yeah, yup. Then the Power user would have that access for their own set of user.\nANGELA\n6:15 \nYeah.\nREBECCA\n6:17 \nAnother thing that we wanted to know where some of the details of that payment add on. Just what is the transaction fee look like? What does that look like just because that we look at moving? And we wanna make sure that that's something we.\nCAROLINE\n6:33 \nYeah. So I'll just maybe clarify a little bit first around on around language. And then John, I think this will probably be mostly you who handles this question, but we have an eCommerce platform built into Docebo. It is, I would say probably more on the basic side of eCommerce platforms. We're definitely not Shopify. We're a learning platform that's able to facilitate purchasing courses. So really what I think would be valuable for us to spend our time on today is getting an understanding of what eCommerce looks like for you and what payment processors you're currently working with and then making sure that Docebo ticks all of your boxes.\nPayment Gateway ends\nCAROLINE\n7:16 \nSo, I think maybe it's a good place to start with you. But John, is there anything you wanted to add there that I didn't touch on?\nJONATHAN\n7:26 \nNo, I think starting kind of with what you're looking for in terms of the eCommerce would be good. And then I don't know we could visit ours if that makes sense further. But yeah, better to get the info here.\nPayment Gateway\nREBECCA\n7:42 \nI don't know if at you.\nANGELA\n7:45 \n30.\nREBECCA\n7:46 \nCame…\nANGELA\n7:47 \nYeah. Why don't you set what we handle now?\nSETH\n7:52 \nSo, the majority of payments for kind of various different things, whether it be, you know, our virtual training purchasing publications. We just go through job forms and that is sync through our authorized net account. So as far as like payment processing fields and functionality, I mean, it's all what job forms itself provides us with. As far as customers placing payments for kind of standard invoices, we have a pay fee section on our website where again, it sync through authorized dot net. It's basically a bunch of form fields. They submit it that way. In the past, we've use some Paypal integration for some of this. As far as our current learning solution… we're kind of siloed from it because we don't you know, directly receive payment. We, you know, it funnels through the platform and then we receive, you know, I think it's a quarterly payment for, you know, all license purchase and that sort of thing. So it's pretty bare bones. Right now. It's not like we have an eCommerce solution that we use, you know, like a Shopify or something like that. It's primarily handled through jot form or again through a third party that just pays us for revenue received.\nCAROLINE\n9:13 \nSo, just to be clear, your ideal scenario is to move away from job forms, have learners be able to find a course on your website or through your marketing collateral, decide that they want to purchase it. Maybe they can preview the course or something like that before they purchase it. They're adding in all of those fields and they're able to purchase the course through your LMS. Is there any requirements around taxing? How does tax work with your courses?\nSETH\n9:48 \nThat's probably a question for our finance department.\nANGELA\n9:52 \nA good question. We should.\nSETH\n9:53 \nAsk…\nANGELA\n9:55 \nWe, yeah.\nJEN\n9:56 \nI'm sorry, ask about taxes?\nANGELA\n9:59 \nYes. Yeah.\nJEN\n10:01 \nDo we collect taxes on our?\nANGELA\n10:06 \nYeah.\nJEN\n10:06 \nI do not.\nANGELA\n10:07 \nOkay.\nCAROLINE\n10:08 \nPerfect. Well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Caroline discussed what the eCommerce platform looks like in Docebo and asked Jonathan to further discuss what they are looking for.\n• Seth provided info on their current payment processors, including authorized.net, PayPal, and eCommerce solutions.\n• Angela asked if they collect taxes on their products which Jen answered no.

{"prompt":"ANGELA\n15:40 \nSo, you know, am I making sense? So could once somebody finish, could they add another user within the 50? Or is it… duplicated? Maybe that's the best way to say it.\nJONATHAN\n15:55 \nYeah. For the, so I'll need to just double check this.\nCertifications\nJONATHAN\n16:01 \nBut in the case of seats, I do believe that those are kind of one time but licenses you would potentially be able to be removed. I think the main thing that I will call out is that if you do give someone access to a course and I believe if you revoke that license once they're enrolled in the course, it's not gonna automatically remove them from the course, they would still have access to it if they've already started to take it basically.\nCourse Enrollment\nANGELA\n16:28 \nOkay.\nJONATHAN\n16:29 \nSo all verified.\nANGELA\n16:31 \nOkay.\nJONATHAN\n16:32 \nYeah. Yeah. I'll verify the status of the licenses and the reassign?\nANGELA\n16:38 \nOkay. Thank you.\nANGELA\n16:46 \nWhat's…\nCAROLINE\n16:46 \nNice Rebecca.\nREBECCA\n16:47 \nOkay. So I think you mentioned it in the last meeting and I have it here just so that I can get some more information, but we, you know, do a lot of our hosting of our live training through Zoom. And so I know that you had said that you can link out to Zoom, but is it within the Docebo platform? So it's not like you're really linking out to Zoom. You're doing everything from that website?\nCAROLINE\n17:15 \nGood question. So you register through Docebo and you access the Zoom link through Docebo. So I can actually, I can pull it up here. I should just be leaving this open. You do go out to a Zoom link, but the reason for that is because they're coming in through Docebo. We're able to track attendance for you… and you're also able to include content in that course. So you can have tests, you can have surveys, include slides, and you can also, when the session is over, if you have it recorded, you can house it in here as well so that people can refer back to it. So what it would look like is a user would come into the platform, they would choose their session. And then when it's time to join, there will be a join now button here with Zoom, and then it will open a Zoom window.\nANGELA\n18:25 \nBut all the information about it is coming to Docebo. So they're reminders for the course and stuff. Okay?\nCAROLINE\n18:31 \nCorrect. Yeah. And it's really up to you how you want to remind your learners.\nLayout & Content\nCAROLINE\n18:37 \nSo some examples are Notifications like that will come up here. You can also get email Notifications. You can also make sure that they're getting a calendar invite to the live training, and then similarly like we talked about, I'll go to this custom dashboard. We talked about all of these being widgets. So as an example, we created this banner for an upcoming Webinar. So maybe you're really wanting to kind of boost engagement for a Webinar, you can have some like banner images that are getting people excited about it. Maybe you want to have a count down or something along those lines?\nCourse Enrollment\nANGELA\n19:17 \nOkay, great. Yeah.\nJEN\n19:19 \nHow… how does that work for us? Is there actually that integration though? So all those users are being added to Zoom?\nCAROLINE\n19:34 \nSo…\nJEN\n19:35 \nIt's just the one link. I mean, we don't have to worry about adding emails to Zoom at all.\nCAROLINE\n19:41 \nNo, that's correct. And one of the nice things too is Docebo will actually create a Zoom link for you. So you're not having to do that manually. Okay? Does that answer that question?\nIntegrations\nREBECCA\n19:58 \nOne of the, there were two other areas that we were talking about integration with. One of them is our CRM, which is Microsoft dynamic. There are certain customers who might be in different tracks like maybe it's a certification track that we would want to do some of the following, some of the tracking within here. How would that work? Is that something that's integrated how I don't know exactly how it works or if I'm asking?\nCAROLINE\n20:26 \nSo, so if you could just explain like what you're looking to bring over from Microsoft dynamics into Docebo. I think that will help us answer the question.\nREBECCA\n20:37 \nI think it would probably be more of the people who are certified. And if we wanted to have our learner management all through Docebo, which we may not, but I know that was on our list is having our CRM possibly be integrated. I don't know if Jen or Seth, you know.\nANGELA\n20:54 \nYeah. Yeah. Jen is the one who could talk about what she would see.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Angela and Jonathan discussed certifications, course enrollment, layout & content, and integrations.\n• Jen raised a question on how integration works with regard to Microsoft Dynamics CRM. END"}
{"prompt":"JEN\n21:04 \nWell… so if you're talking about certification and like the interviewer trainer certifications, that has… you know, the learner name their organization that they're tied to, right? The level of certification, again, trainer or interviewer, adult, child and youth, email address, we keep track of. They're usually on a two year rotation. We track that by email. I'm probably not explaining this good enough because I really haven't thought about… if we're gonna keep it in both places, if it's going to be in just one place. We also Bill out of the CRM. So I'm not sure if we'd be able to Bill out of Docebo. I'm just, you know, I haven't really started thinking about all this yet.\nIntegrations\nJONATHAN\n22:08 \nSo, I guess for, so in the case of something like Microsoft dynamics, when we're talking about using that, I guess to drive the certifications they're taking within Docebo. So would that be kinda syncing of users, so automatically creating accounts within Docebo based off the information in dynamics, and then would you want them to be automatically assigned to a particular, maybe set of courses tied to a certification?\nREBECCA\n22:36 \nYou know, I think probably added and maybe isn't something because part of me is like listening to this. We don't drive a lot of the certification work at all through those type of platform, right?\nANGELA\n22:50 \nI think that I guess for me is there's lots of questions to be answered, but the key question is for us in terms of what we want, is there a way to have communication between Docebo and dynamics? Is there a way to link either way whether we would want to dump info from Docebo back over to our CRM or whether we want, you know, some to pull some info out of the CRM and to Docebo? So, I think the basic question, is there a communication possibility between two?\nJONATHAN\n23:25 \nOkay. So, so yes, there is there's nothing, let's say kinda out of the box for what that information would be, that's passed back and forth, but we have, I have worked with other customers to integrate with dynamics. And there's kinda two man. Well, there's three three routes but the two main ones are either just using our APIs. If you have the technical team familiar with it. That is one way because as far as the information within the platform, you can basically access and manage most of that using our APIs. So in terms of getting data in and out of the platform, we also have something called Docebo connect, which is an integration platform as a service, which is a low code method of building out integrations between different platforms. And that does have a prebuilt connector for dynamics 365 with some predefined actions for working with dynamics 365 as well. You can bring in further custom actions, but kinda depending on what you wanna do, that helps simplify creating that integration a bit. So yes, it can be done. It's just a matter of what's the approach you'd wanna go with.\nIntegrations ends\nANGELA\n24:36 \nSure. Okay. And that's something we need to think about and talk a lot more about internally. Yeah, great.\nCAROLINE\n24:42 \nYeah. So whenever you've kind of figured out what that ideal scenario is, let's set up another time like this and we can hash it out, talk about what it costs, what it looks like to set that up and all of your options.\nNotifications\nREBECCA\n24:59 \nI have email marketing. One of the things for integration that we have listed. I don't know if you talk about that or is that? Yeah, I don't know.\nSETH\n25:12 \nYeah. It was basically similar kind of question of the dynamics issue of is there any communication functionality for Docebo through to we use campaign monitor for our email marketing platform, just that. And more specifically what I mean by that is like, so we have automated, they call them journeys email Automation set up to campaign monitor. You know, if someone signs up for Docebo, you know, could it be that they are plugged into a subscriber list in campaign monitor? Which then we do on our end of, you know, funneling them into like a in automated email campaign, something like that?\nCAROLINE\n25:52 \nThat's a good question. I haven't had that asked before. Have you to come across that more than I?\nJONATHAN\n25:58 \nYeah. Something similar, another campaign system. So in the case of campaign monitor, I'm not familiar with that particular application, but yes. So we a typical way of kind of automatically adding someone to a list there is. So I did mention we have our APIs, but we also have web hooks for different events within the platform. So someone new person registers that can fire off an event and then use that to maybe add them to a new list within campaign monitor or even course completion, something else within the platform to drive some activity in the external platform as far as once again nothing prebuilt for campaign monitor, but would be ways to do that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jonathan discussed ways to integrate Docebo with Microsoft Dynamics.\n• Angela asked about whether two way communication between Docebo and the CRM was possible.\n• Rebecca mentioned email marketing as an integration possibility, and Seth asked if users could be plugged into a subscriber list in Campaign Monitor.

{"prompt":"ANGELA\n32:10 \nYeah. And what if again, where this is in the weeds, but what if they enroll, but they didn't participate? So we have a large number of people who might or not a large number, but we often have times where people enroll, but then don't actually show up and participate in the event.\nCAROLINE\n32:31 \nJohn, do you know the answer to that one?\nJONATHAN\n32:34 \nIf they're not actually attending the event? So if they, if they're just enrolled and they haven't actually interacted with the content, let's say or the like they haven't launched into the, if it's an Instructor like training using Zoom, then they would not count.\nLearning Plans\nANGELA\n32:49 \nOkay, great. Thank you.\nSETH\n32:52 \nHave to keep going in into the weeds. But… the reason things as we actually run into these, you know? So we gotta kinda figure out.\nJONATHAN\n33:00 \nAbsolutely.\nCHRIS\n33:01 \nWork.\nSETH\n33:01 \nIn practice. So, like if we have Rebecca and let's say she is a user because she has already purchased like E learning courses if we just want to call it that. And then we have a separate live virtual training that's a part of for, from our perspective, that's not part of what she purchased as far as the E learning courses she'd have to purchase on top of that for access to this virtual training… for one like does, is that possible? Does that work? Or I guess it, does that make sense?\nPricing\nCAROLINE\n33:36 \nI think you're yeah. So I mean, she would only take up one seat in that scenario for that month and she would be paying for whatever you want her to be paying for, I think is the simplest answer, but she's not gonna take.\nANGELA\n33:51 \nTwo.\nCAROLINE\n33:52 \nSeats because he's up there from different audiences.\nCourse Enrollment\nANGELA\n33:54 \nOkay. So she could pay twice but only be counted once. Yeah. Okay.\nJONATHAN\n34:00 \nYeah. As a user for that month, yeah. And just…\nANGELA\n34:04 \nOkay.\nJONATHAN\n34:04 \nFor the purchase scenario, using our E commerce, you can set it up to purchase individual sessions. So if one was the virtual session and one was live session, they would just, they would need to, I guess purchase both if you set it up that way. But then, yeah, they would still only count as one.\nPricing\nANGELA\n34:21 \nOne.\nJONATHAN\n34:22 \nUser for that month.\nANGELA\n34:24 \nOkay, perfect.\nCAROLINE\n34:26 \nSo, with that in mind, I'm curious because we didn't really talk too much about this. How many users would you anticipate would be engaging with content in a given month and you don't have to give me exact numbers by any means. But like ballpark, what are you thinking?\nPricing ends\nANGELA\n34:45 \nWe're all sitting here stating… there are so many different variables set you're probably best. Yeah.\nSETH\n34:56 \nYeah, part of it is us making terminations internally as far as like how wide of a net is our LMS solution gonna be cast? Because, you know, we've had discussions of, you know, we have a creditation and, you know, would we produce LMS courses for users that would be onboarding, they would pay separately for?\nPricing\nSETH\n35:18 \nBut we're just giving them as like an added value. I'd say, sorry, I, I'd say kinda like just to give us a general ballpark, I mean, as far as active users per month, I mean, if we toss out a number of like 200 to the free factor in a virtual pom workshop for 12 people, a virtual training for 30, and then, you know, a few 12 on top of that, well, Webinar is free and we separate that out which I feel like we're leaning in that direction, you know, maybe just for the paid options I'd say, you know, for pom courses, those kinds of things, maybe around 200 Ish, it's really hard to get.\nANGELA\n35:55 \nAnd we also have to count in who are currently accessing our courses through Elias because we'd be being done with that and driving those folks. It's not a huge number but we need to think of that for adding.\nCAROLINE\n36:11 \nWell, I'll tell you the good news is we start with up to 300 monthly active users that's our lowest here. So it sounds like you'd fit perfectly into that and it would be kind of a safe category for you to be in because you'll have potentially some wiggle room there. So it's a monthly. It's a monthly count but it's an annual subscription. So you'd be subscribing to 300 monthly active users on an annual basis.\nANGELA\n36:42 \nOkay. All right.\nSETH\n36:44 \nSo, what is on a particular month? We have a surge and we have, you know, we bumped up to 500 people on access. How does that work? Like a pro rate it or how does that, how would that work?\nCAROLINE\n36:55 \nYeah. So first of all, we'll never be surprised if you're going to like bump up against your limit and no one's ever going to be locked out of the system.\nPricing ends\nCAROLINE\n37:04 \nSo usually for those surges in an organization like yours, I would imagine you can plan for it to some extent. There's probably a big Webinar or something like that. So in those scenarios, you'll want to let your account manager know that that's going to happen so that they can support you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Angela asked what happens when people enroll but don't participate in an event.

{"prompt":"CAROLINE\n37:21 \nIf it's gonna be a one off month. The most economical solution is probably to pay the premium per user fee for those additional 200 grid. It's five dollars and 90 cents. And I know that's out of context, we haven't looked at pricing yet, but it's five dollars and 90 cents per overage user. So if it's only one month, it probably makes sense to do that. If you are pushing up against that 300 mark on an ongoing basis and you think you're going to be at 500 for the next year, then you can bump up to the up to 500 model and it will just be prorated and you'd pay the difference for the year.\nPricing ends\nANGELA\n38:08 \nYeah.\nCAROLINE\n38:09 \nSo never any surprises. Yeah.\nCAROLINE\n38:19 \nWere there any other questions Rebecca?\nREBECCA\n38:21 \nYeah. So, and I think you talked about it in the meeting but I wasn't in, but there are content creation tools in dot, but we would have to import a form or something else file, right?\nCAROLINE\n38:35 \nYeah, it depends to some extent what you're looking to create. I would say that Docebo has lightweight content creation tool. So the only reason I call that out is because content offering is used differently by different people. Sometimes folks are just looking to create quizzes and tests and that type of thing, all of that can be done within Docebo. So quizzes, tests, assignments, surveys, all of that can be done within Docebo. And they can be made quite interactive if you do want to get funcier with your content and you want to have more of like scorm capabilities that would be done outside of Docebo and played and hosted within?\nANGELA\n39:19 \nAnd you had indicated before that you had two or three that you recommend or that you used or have, you know, experience with. Could you give us those names?\nCAROLINE\n39:33 \nYeah, I'm gonna take it back and ask what we're hearing in the industry being the best, but I'll tell you off the top of my head. The one we hear the most is Articulate, we're hearing a lot of that from our customers for sure. But let me get a list and maybe I'll see if I can find like what the best like cheap option is, and then what like the best kind of more expensive option is?\nANGELA\n39:57 \nThat'll be lovely. Thank you.\nREBECCA\n40:01 \nWith, so say that we are importing these content creation, the content. Yeah, we import it and then have it be a course that we duplicate across a lot of different users in different categories.\nCAROLINE\n40:18 \nHRIS, that's a question.\nCHRIS\n40:20 \nYeah. So bringing inter course that you've already?\nREBECCA\n40:24 \nLet's say I brought in a just an intro, a four hour course that's a stopping course, but I want Alabama to have it and I want another group of users to be able to have it. Could I duplicate it across?\nCHRIS\n40:36 \nYeah. So there's a couple of different ways and it kinda really depends on the scenario. So if it's maybe the original course is specific to a certain area such as like a state like Alabama, but if you're gonna use this course again for Georgia, there's a slight difference in that case, yes, just go ahead and duplicate the course, which is a very simple option that you have and the course management. And then I just re title it such and such for Georgia and make the small changes. And now the Georgia Audience has a different version of the course and the Alabama Audience. If there is no need for a difference between them, then there's no reason to duplicate the course. That same course can live in multiple catalogs and go to multiple audiences.\nANGELA\n41:25 \nOkay. Perfect. And…\nJONATHAN\n41:29 \nSimilar…\nCAROLINE\n41:29 \nFor training materials. So, for example, training materials is kind of the bits and pieces that make up a course. So videos scorm files, all that type of thing. So, if you had two different courses that have the same introduction video, you can be pulling that introduction video from your central repository and putting it into multiple courses.\nANGELA\n41:52 \nPerfect. Okay.\nCAROLINE\n41:55 \nThat what you were going to add there, Jonathan?\nJONATHAN\n41:58 \nThat's exactly.\nCAROLINE\n41:59 \nSharing a brain.\nCHRIS\n42:07 \nThese are all great questions by the way, I'm learning a ton as we're doing this.\nANGELA\n42:12 \nSo, are we?\nJONATHAN\n42:13 \nThis has been?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Angea asked Caroline to provide the best content creation tool names she knows in the industry.

{"prompt":"ANGELA\n42:14 \nQuite an adventure for us. So, yeah, we naively have this vision and now we're learning the realities. So, yeah.\nCAROLINE\n42:22 \nYeah, you're asking great questions.\nREBECCA\n42:25 \nAll right. Well, I'm gonna keep a, there a couple that's okay. So, the other question is…\nCAROLINE\n42:34 \nFor…\nREBECCA\n42:35 \nTechnical assistance, let's say I forgot my password as a user. It's not something that Docebo is dealing with those minor tech issues or would that go through us as, you know, that type of administrator?\nCAROLINE\n42:49 \nYeah. For end user like your learners, that would be going through you. But for any questions that you have that would be going through Docebo, the nice thing is that Docebo does have a lot of resources on our website that would be helpful for end users. So, our knowledge base for example, is a really great one. We have Docebo university, all that kind of stuff. So it's not an issue that we run into a heck of a lot, which is why we don't have it.\nANGELA\n43:20 \nYeah. Yeah. That looks great. That link you sent us before was very useful. Yeah.\nCAROLINE\n43:26 \nSo good.\nREBECCA\n43:28 \nAnother question I have is just if I am a learner and I come in for, you know, a one off training and I know I'd be active in the system, you know, for our purposes, I'd be counted once for that, but how long do I have access to the first material?\nCertifications\nREBECCA\n43:46 \nDo, can we limit that or how long am I able to come in and actually access what I as a learner have?\nCHRIS\n43:55 \nYeah. That's a really good one. So you can set expiration dates for or validity periods, sorry, four courses. So let's say once you have enrolled, maybe that starts your date time, you have 30 days after 30 days, you no longer have access to it. There's one way for actual access to the platform, you can also set expiration dates for learners as well.\nBranches & Groups\nREBECCA\n44:27 \nCould we also not have an expiration date?\nCHRIS\n44:29 \nYeah, absolutely.\nREBECCA\n44:37 \nAll right.\nREBECCA\n44:43 \nI think I'm just going through the list of our costs. I know we wrote down that we wanted a couple more details on the categorizing and grouping of courses like the catalogs and branching, but I didn't know if you had specific or a specific example.\nSETH\n45:03 \nIt, it kinda goes back to like the kind of like… different tiers of access, like what like to what level, you can specify, you know, certain sub groups of a larger group have access to these courses. Others only have access to these, just kind of how you can slice and dice up course content and who can view them and use the.\nCHRIS\n45:27 \nYeah. So that can be done through our main structure which is our Branches and sub Branches. But if I'm really thinking about that particular scenario, I, I'd imagine you want to be a bit more flexible. So I would use our concept of groups potentially. So as Caroline is logging in here, so it all depends on exactly how you want to set that up. So I can establish that this potential branch on the left hand side or sub Branches, we go further down. They have exclusive access to this particular catalog, as many of those as I'd like to do if you wanna make it more flexible. And when I hear the word like tier of users or tiers of customers, this is where my mind goes that goes towards our group functionality. So the groups are people that can be a part of different Branches and sub Branches. But I do have something in common. These can be Automatic or manual and that can totally change access to different pieces of content catalogs of content, whatever the case may be. So maybe you have, you know, tier one, two and three client levels that can be exactly how you set that up.\nBranches & Groups ends\nCAROLINE\n46:47 \nThe wheels are turning. What are the questions that you have around that?\nSETH\n46:54 \nNo, I mean it seems like there's a ton of customization. I just, I think it's like for me, it's like I need to like click around and, you know, just kinda play with it a little bit and see how it, I think that's going like I'll just based on everything you described especially the last time where you talked through and I'll probably use the wrong terms of Branches versus group. It feels like it's solving all the or addressing all the questions. I think it's more just kinda playing with it and seeing like in reality, how does it actually work? You know, how do you, how do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Rebecca asked about technical assistance for users.\n END"}

I never know which one's bigger if it's the branch or the group… I can send over some collateral that we might have on that will help paint the picture. But I think like as with all of these things, it's a little bit easier when you can see it from like your own use case.\nBranches & Groups\nCAROLINE\n47:55 \nSo in the example here, like you're gonna start with kind of your broadest categorization of groups. So maybe this is like by state, would that be kind of like the most zoomed out way that you would organize your users?\nANGELA\n48:13 \nNo, I mean we would have a level of user that's international basically.\nBranches & Groups ends\nANGELA\n48:19 \nOkay. We have folks all over the world who might be logging in to take our courses or participate in something.\nCAROLINE\n48:28 \nSo potentially by country.\nREBECCA\n48:32 \nIf we were doing it out that way, I can also see it by our like what kind of learner are you coming in about? Personal outcome measures? Are you coming in to take one of our post a, and maybe that's the way we do it because we do have so many different customers.\nJONATHAN\n48:51 \nSo.\nCAROLINE\n48:52 \nI think that's a really good point. Rebecca, I'm sorry to cut you off there, Chris. I wanna hear what you have to add.\nBranches & Groups\nCAROLINE\n48:57 \nBut just before I lose this train of thought when you're thinking about organizing your learners, it's not necessarily just categorizing people. It's thinking about how, what are the different learning journeys that you want to deliver to these groups? And that's the way that you want to organize it. So when they're put into a specific branch or a specific group, they're not just organized so that you can find them there. It's also determining what experience they have when they're logging into the platform. So, I guess it's that's what you need to be thinking about a little bit more than just, you know, what countries and what states and whatnot…\nBranches & Groups ends\nANGELA\n49:41 \nYeah. I think that's an excellent point, Caroline because we do have folks who are just coming for a one off. Like Seth talks about a one off training. And then there's other people who really are on journeys with us through different learning and certification and the creditation. And so that's excellent kind of thing for us to be thinking about.\nBranches & Groups\nCHRIS\n50:03 \nThat's a really cool process there. So what I would really envision this for you guys, the branch and sub branch structure would really just be for the hard data where who is the person? Where are they? Where they belong, you know, to for us inside of the system. And then potentially groups would be the more dynamic thing that controls. Okay, well, they have access to such and such from here.\nANGELA\n50:26 \nYeah.\nCAROLINE\n50:33 \nSo another thing to maybe give a little bit of thought to on your end. And then once you have an idea of how you want to organize those learners, we can change some of these titles to be to match what the way you would want it to be so that you can visualize it.\nBranches & Groups ends\nCAROLINE\n50:51 \nWe can also talk about how you're actually bringing those users in whether you know, what system they're coming from, whether it be eCommerce or your CRM or wherever it is they're coming from, and validate the way that we're bringing them in so that you're not having to come in here every single day. They're being enrolled automatically based on what you can figure in your onboarding process.\nNotifications\nANGELA\n51:18 \nRight.\nREBECCA\n51:24 \nI think the only other question other than, you know, saying more of that back end, the administrative end which I know we've been seeing. But the other is just list what customization is available for automated email, follow up with our external users. So if we wanna follow up after, I know we talked through marketing, how do we customize what that looks like to communicate after to say, thanks for taking our course? You might be interested in these to.\nCHRIS\n51:54 \nIt does, it kinda depends on exactly what you're trying to achieve. Jonathan might be better at speaking to this than I am, but I think I believe that starts or notification center. So from our, be in the middle there.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Caroline suggested organizing learners by country and differentiating between one-off trainings and those participating in journeys with learning and certification.\n• Chris suggested using branches for hard data about the learners, like their location, and using groups for dynamic control of what they have access to.\n• Rebecca asked about customizing automated emails for external users to follow up on marketing efforts.\n• Jonathan mentioned the notification center as a starting point for controlling communication. END"}
{"prompt":"JONATHAN\n52:12 \nBottom of the second Colon. Yeah.\nCHRIS\n52:17 \nHow many prebuilt Notifications do we have in here, John?\nJONATHAN\n52:21 \nBuilt? Yeah.\nCHRIS\n52:23 \nA lot.\nJONATHAN\n52:24 \nYou, in terms of the events?\nCHRIS\n52:26 \nYeah. So it depends on events and then you can customize from there. So what is starting this email chain or response or whatever the case may be, and then utilizing short codes. It's very simple to kind of craft that email to say, hey, you complete it such and such, this course is really helpful for if you want to continue on this journey and that short code will take them right to where they can go preview it maybe and go ahead and roll into that course. So that's where my mind first goes, John. If you had anything else to add to that.\nJONATHAN\n53:03 \nYeah. I mean beyond that, you can then, so you can also configure the emails in different languages. If you need to support them, have that both as email and in app Notifications. But then beyond that, you can have them be scheduled for different times around that event. A lot of them will be at the time of the event because that's when it makes the most sense.\nBranches & Groups\nJONATHAN\n53:24 \nBut some might be like something's expiring in a few days or you want something to happen weekly. You have further control around that scheduling. And then the last thing would be that you can also designate certain Notifications to only go to certain types of users or certain kind of groups or Branches.\nBranches & Groups ends\nJONATHAN\n53:43 \nSo if you want something to be branded or you wanna make sure that a certain group gets regular Notifications of something, you can customize the Notifications further around that.\nREBECCA\n53:57 \nThat answer that question for you, Seth… I know.\nSETH\n54:01 \nYeah, yeah. I think it does. I think what we were looking at as far as the opportunities for this would be like, you know, they complete the series of courses under a certain category, you know, personal measures, you know, using the, you know, automated email functionality out of this to then promote, you know, then, you know, maybe even doing things outside of Docebo of like engaging with us for certification related to those courses is kind of being the introductory information, that sort of thing.\nNotifications\nCAROLINE\n54:32 \nYeah. So I think that will be a combination from an email perspective. I think that will be a combination of how you want to set up those email Notifications and then also potentially sequences that are triggered in your email marketing app. If they completed a certain course, maybe they're put into a certain sequence.\nNotifications ends\nCAROLINE\n54:53 \nWe also do have a I based recommendations. So when a learner is in the system and they, once the AI gets to know your learners, you know, if they always take a certain course and then they're taking a similar course right? After eventually the AI will learn that and we'll say like next recommended content for them to engage with.\nNext Steps\nSETH\n55:22 \nKind.\nCAROLINE\n55:23 \nOf like you too.\nANGELA\n55:25 \nYeah, yeah.\nCAROLINE\n55:31 \nSo I'm just keeping an eye on the time here. I know we only have five minutes left. My recommendation is that we schedule some more time to talk about pricing or if you all don't have a hard stop, I can stay on for a few extra minutes and we can cover it off… what works best for you all. I'm happy to book more time and I could even do tomorrow if you wanted.\nREBECCA\n56:00 \nRight. I don't have a hard stop, but I know we might want to spend some more time talking.\nSETH\n56:06 \nAbout it.\nREBECCA\n56:06 \nToo. So I just don't know what the other group might want.\nNext Steps ends\nCAROLINE\n56:14 \nI can also just give you a high, sorry, go ahead.\nSETH\n56:17 \nRight? During the last couple, we talked about it. Maybe if there's any way we can have access to kind of a demo kinda sandbox test site. Is that a possibility? Because I think you at that phase of like, you know… kinda digging into it a little bit to give us a little bit more kind of insight?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jonathan discussed the pre-built Notifications and their customizable features, along with configuring emails in different languages.

{"prompt":"CAROLINE\n56:39 \nYeah, absolutely. So why don't we do this? Why don't we schedule another hour either probably next week at this point and we will talk through. We'll do a trial kick off. So we'll come prepared with some of the key things that you'd like to accomplish in a demo so that we can give you a quick introduction to how you do it so that you're not feeling lost in the system. And then we will also spend kinda the second half hour talking about pricing and onboarding and everything that's included in that. And then we'll give, so after that, I just wanna be transparent. We will give you the keys to the kingdom. So to speak well, we'll give you the log in credentials to the LMS so you can poke around in there and do whatever makes sense, right? Yeah.\nANGELA\n57:27 \nThat sounds great.\nCAROLINE\n57:31 \nAwesome. Do we wanna book that while we're on the call now? Or does it make sense? We're back up for you and I to arrange over email?\nREBECCA\n57:39 \nNow, just because everybody has their calendars, and sometimes I don't know about private appointment. So, okay.\nCAROLINE\n57:47 \nSounds good. I have calendars up. It looks like there's a gap on our end for Tuesday between most of you in Eastern Time zone… all over the place.\nANGELA\n58:06 \nI think we're…\nCHRIS\n58:07 \nAll we're…\nANGELA\n58:09 \nCost here.\nCAROLINE\n58:12 \nOkay. So, I'll share it in Central Time. So from one to two 30 Central Time on Tuesday, we have some time… is there an hour in there that works?\nREBECCA\n58:28 \nOne to two, Angela and I have already have a meeting that we could replace with, I think and move.\nCAROLINE\n58:33 \nOkay.\nANGELA\n58:36 \nNo, that's eastern, you're talking?\nREBECCA\n58:39 \nYeah.\nANGELA\n58:41 \nWe've…\nREBECCA\n58:41 \nGot…\nANGELA\n58:43 \nYeah.

One one central works. Okay, perfect. So, I'll…\nREBECCA\n59:08 \nWait a…\nANGELA\n59:09 \nSec, wait a sec. Wait a sec. Step has something to say.\nSETH\n59:16 \nI can't I could maybe hop on by one 30 central, I could catch it a little late.\nCAROLINE\n59:24 \nDoes one 30 work? Because I can do, let me just see here. We can do one 30 to two 30.\nSETH\n59:32 \nYeah, if that works.\nANGELA\n59:34 \nYeah. Does that work for you, Jen and Maddie?\nCHRIS\n59:38 \nYeah, that's fine for me.\nJEN\n59:39 \nThat's…\nANGELA\n59:40 \nOkay.\nCAROLINE\n59:43 \nOkay. Okay. So, I'll send that over and we'll walkthrough the trial and then pricing and onboarding.\nOnboarding\nCAROLINE\n59:55 \nOkay. So, what would be helpful? Like you came prepared with questions today? If you, if there's like three or four things that you really want to accomplish in a trial, we'll make sure that we just kind of walkthrough those in the kickoff so that you're set up for success in doing it on your own.\nWrap-Up\nCAROLINE\n1:00:17 \nOkay.

{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n0:00 \nHello?\nEMILY\n0:01 \nHey, mark. How are you?\nINGMAR\n0:03 \nWell, how are you doing?\nEMILY\n0:04 \nI'm doing just fine. I'm sorry, I'm a bit late. I have quite the back to back day today but I'm not complaining. It makes the day go by faster. So no problem. Hey… you too. Hey, Matt. Welcome.\nSmall Talk ends\nJENNIFER\n0:21 \nMatt.\nMATT\n0:23 \nEveryone. Nice to meet you John. Nice to meet you.\nJENNIFER\n0:25 \nYou too.\nEMILY\n0:27 \nAll right. Well, let's dive in. Let me introduce Matt. We're gonna spend this hour very much in the platform. So this is your time we're recording, so you can go back. We watch certain aspects, but please know that because this is your hour, we're really going to let you drive. So like, of course, we have our general flow of what we do with demos. But if you want to interrupt us, we welcome it and we, you know, as well as we move through, if there's something that we move too fast away from there's, like a certain element of the platform that you want us to focus on more, say the word interrupt us. We literally welcome it. What you're gonna see at first here, matt's gonna walk us through. Matt's a solutions consultant here at. So he's a functional expert. So when he, anytime I bring up anything that's related to functionality, I always want Matt to be a part of that conversation.\nLayout & Content\nEMILY\n1:17 \nWhat you'll see first just to give you kind of a lay of the land the, you know, 30,000 foot view. We'll start on the learner side. This is very much like a role based demo because there's certain things you can see logged in as a learner versus an admin, that kind of thing. So we'll start really on the learner side. And then as we make our way through and you'll notice too, like there's certain elements of the platform that obviously you can only see if you're an admin, if you're logged in as an admin. So keep in mind also that we are happy to hand over the credentials of this platform.\nLayout & Content ends\nEMILY\n1:49 \nEspecially, I don't offer that to everyone but Jen, I know you're so familiar you've been in the LMS space, whether that's higher Ed platforms or like more… I don't know or enterprise level like Docebo, we feel, you know, comfortable giving you the keys to the kingdom. So we will certainly be able to do that for you. If that's something that you all want to actually get in.\nLayout & Content\nJENNIFER\n2:14 \nQuestion I would have before we get started is, you know, continuity of design is really important. So we started out, say someone hit our web page. We can stylized this page to look exactly like that or we can skip this page altogether with single sign on correct. So we don't even see this page.\nEMILY\n2:30 \nYou got it. Absolutely. Yeah. And we'll talk more about branding, look and feel continuity personalization, all of that. But you're exactly right. Matt, I'll actually let you take the Mike and speak to the SSO piece or the going from the website piece.\nMATT\n2:44 \nAnd actually, and by the way, is it Jen or Jennifer, what do you prefer?\nLayout & Content ends\nEMILY\n2:49 \nYeah, I think I called you.\nJENNIFER\n2:50 \nWhenever is easier, right? I, yeah, it's good. Okay. I'd like to ask just in case.\nMATT\n2:58 \nYeah, but…\nJENNIFER\n3:00 \nJennifer, if you're feeling, you know, like relaxed either one. Yeah, thanks guys.\nMATT\n3:07 \nThen Jennifer, I'm really happy that's actually where you started because that's kinda the first thing I wanted to talk about based on the, I got a chance to listen to the last call.\nPayment Gateway\nMATT\n3:16 \nSo there are some talking points especially from, in regards to like whether or not, you know, this page is ever exposed to whether or not you want people going through a membership section of your own website that you build up first will sort of, or whether or not they even just have like a like access to your website could also be used as a source of S.\nLayout & Content\nMATT\n3:35 \nSo we were fully compatible with a lot. So you can have a scenario where they log into your site first and just click on launch LMS. They never even see this button at that point. Okay? Excellent. Even see this page. And by the way, the reason I wanted to start here as like on a log in page was just to show you a couple of different things because I know it was important to have like both a specific example, we log in here and this is what your members log into the platform and see. But I just wanted to showcase that if I log back out and I come in as a different profile and I call this one non member and log in, you can have these experiences be different. So you can have a scenario where just based on the data that we know about somebody, you can then direct them into different places and that data can be dynamic.\nIntegrations\nMATT\n4:24 \nSo if this is getting fed from like a Salesforce or are you using a membership association or like a membership management software as well? Like anovie or something like that?\nINGMAR\n4:32 \nNo, no. But we're thinking something we might consider.\nMATT\n4:38 \nOkay. I was just asking because in terms of like sources for the data, there's a bunch that we've integrated with in the past to be able to, you know, get that information quickly easily and automatically so that this experience changes based off what you know, about someone because.\nJENNIFER\n4:52 \nHubspot be that, could Hubspot be that place? Okay? That's what?\nMATT\n4:57 \nLike likely like if you, if you're using Hubspot, that's actually a pretty quick and easy one for us to be able to pull.\nJENNIFER\n5:01 \nExcellent. I like the look by the way, this is better, would you agree any more better than what we've…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matt walked through the layout and content of the platform, with Emily explaining how he was a functional expert and would be involved in any discussions related to functionality.\n• Jennifer started a discussion on continuity of design, which Matt addressed by discussing single sign-on and brand continuity.\n• Matt and Ingmar discussed potential integration with Salesforce or other membership management software, before Jennifer asked about Hubspot integration.\n END"}
{"prompt":"INGMAR\n5:07 \nYeah, really?\nJENNIFER\n5:09 \nIt's saying guys.\nMATT\n5:11 \nIt's all your look.\nJENNIFER\n5:13 \nThat's why we like it.\nMATT\n5:15 \nI did was Rob stuff from your website?\nEMILY\n5:18 \nIt looks.\nJENNIFER\n5:19 \nI'll tell you what your widgets look more polished if you go somewhere like I want.\nEMILY\n5:26 \nTo say it's d2l…\nJENNIFER\n5:27 \nBright space in for reason and all of their widgets.\nLayout & Content ends\nJENNIFER\n5:30 \nThere's like this little down arrow beside every single one. Like inside the box and it's something that I don't think should be visible is like an old HTML style. You know, I don't really know why that was. So this is kind of more like what we were looking for from a, I think a design perspective. This looks more refreshed. It looks modern. A lot of these, a lot of the higher Ed LMS were, you know, developed back in like early 2000 or even earlier, some of them. So, yeah, this looks great. I like.\nEMILY\n6:00 \nYou see it from the back end because.\nJENNIFER\n6:03 \nThat's the part I care about, right?\nLayout & Content\nEMILY\n6:05 \nYep. It takes no coding whatsoever. It's literally driven like it's so easy. We do allow our clients to actually use CSS and HTML if they want to. But by no means is it necessary.\nMATT\n6:19 \nOkay. Just in terms of like you're saying a universal look and feel so that it matches your website kind of thing. I actually loaded a few examples of like real world client instances in here to give you an idea. So this is one made entirely out of the box tools. There's nothing like to be honest, this took them probably like two minutes to set up the page and then like three hours in photoshop to make the stuff work, right? So the media will take you longer than the platform. But if you want to get into the PML and CSS, you can do something like this where it's a little bit more like heavy of an effort, but you really, you know, like the top bar changes to match, you know, this and the, there's a background image and stuff like that gotcha scale of one to 10 in terms of effort.\nLayout & Content ends\nMATT\n7:09 \nI mean, like something like whereas like this all out of the box and nothing here. Especially, this is like a one or two on a scale of one to 10. This is probably closer to 10.\nJENNIFER\n7:21 \nOkay. I actually like the ones look better to be honest. I think the other one looks a little bit too busy. You know, the one where they customized it. Yeah.\nMATT\n7:28 \nYeah. If you really wanna go to like this is an example of one of our clients, like you might have heard of them. They on a scale of one to 10 in terms of effort, this is a 12. If you have money is absolutely no concern and you have a team of developers. Great.\nEMILY\n7:51 \nGo for it.\nJENNIFER\n7:52 \nYeah, but we could get started with something that is more out of the box. It will look, I think as a part of what we offer right now, we're better. Do you think this looks about the same or better so far?\nINGMAR\n8:04 \nI mean, I still wanna, I still can, I mean on first glance, things look good. I wanna see a little bit more. I guess one of my, could you actually go to the other screen where it was like a 10 the?\nMATT\n8:18 \nYeah, yeah, for sure.\nINGMAR\n8:22 \nActually fire. Okay. I was like there's something about, I don't know, I think it's great marketing because, yeah, I didn't know his Dennis but I was thinking about like I was thinking about fried chicken for some reason. I don't know why. Okay, maybe the ignite. So… so my question would be… so obviously, these are each module, roll out virtual restaurants. These are all images that I assume are links that will take you to pages that are under each of those, you know. So, so like the shift lead trainer program that's for the shift leads development program for general managers.\nLayout & Content\nINGMAR\n9:08 \nSo, you know, this is we're getting into sort of the thick of the question of like a membership area, right? And you, I could very much see a layout design like this where these links aren't just taking you to a course, meaning, you know, a learning experience, but there might be some other content that's behind that. So I just wanna see, is that right?\nMATT\n9:31 \n100 percent. And actually, so, in terms of, in terms of the design like this main landing page that I built here, this is entirely designed around in platform experience where like they're learning and they're going through the course and things like that are inherently LMS functions. But I did build this another page into here that is designed to showcase more of a like a customized function that's got like an HTML zone with different links to different sections.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matt showed an example of a client’s instance that used out of the box tools to create the page.\n• Ingmar wanted to see an example that was closer to 10 on a scale from one to ten in terms of effort.\n• The group discussed creating a membership area that had links taking users to courses as well as other content. END"}
{"prompt":"MATT\n10:01 \nYou can even I frame some of this stuff in if it exists elsewhere. But like, you know, far more HTML and CSS heavy to be a functional page that is more membership SK than learning SK.\nINGMAR\n10:17 \nRight.\nMATT\n10:18 \nWhere you could have resources in here that aren't LMS specific?\nINGMAR\n10:22 \nRight. Right. Right. That's the idea is like, I get, right? So like… you know, of course, these are all terms that can be, they're defined and in different, or they can be operationalized into different things. So like, right, what I'm hearing from you really clearly is that there could be a box here, a link that link could take you, it could say resources and it could just be a page that has here all these different PDFS that you can use. It's not necessarily a less than one less than two, less than three.\nIntegrations\nJENNIFER\n10:57 \nRight. Yeah. So.\nINGMAR\n10:59 \nWhich is, and then what I'm hearing is also that you could I frame things if it wasn't I mean, ideally, we would like to build everything out within Docebo. But if there's some limitation, we could use the I frame? Yeah.\nMATT\n11:11 \nExactly. I mean this.\nINGMAR\n11:12 \nIs this is really fun?\nIntegrations ends\nJENNIFER\n11:13 \nI, to, I can relate to this a little bit to Ingmar, because we had alumni groups where people go in and do things that were not course related, but they were getting access to forms resources, their transcripts certificates, all that stuff. So, yeah, I can relate to what you're trying to do. You know, to that degree. I definitely think this looks like they're capable of that.\nLayout & Content\nMATT\n11:37 \nYeah. And so like, well, so Jennifer and Ingmar, along those lines like it's a different page. This is actually the main landing page that I created, but I just added some of that to the page rather than make it navigational. So, like if there's a PDF or a powerpoint or an additional resource, it's not curricular related.\nLayout & Content ends\nMATT\n11:52 \nIt's not course related. It's an extra resource. I just threw it on a page here. But oftentimes you'll see people give that as a widget on a small page, but oftentimes you'll see people give this its own dedicated page. And then like just like you were saying, you make a link, it brings them.\nINGMAR\n12:07 \nRight. Right. Right. Yeah. Well, this is really cool. So… you know, this is, I think this is the first, you know, MS that we've come across that is looks like we're you know, we're there. We've got the functionality and we got the asthetics… you'll be surprised how hard put those two things together.\nLayout & Content\nJENNIFER\n12:32 \nTo a lot. Yeah.\nINGMAR\n12:34 \nSo let me before we, because I definitely want to use today to also just, I want to see what course looks like. But before we get there, there's another kind of question here. So, I heard, you know, you say that there was a log in page and you could have essentially, you know, different log INS take people to different simulating that membership experience if you will get guided to a different homepage with different functionality.\nPayment Gateway\nINGMAR\n13:05 \nI'm curious. We ran into this problem with the different MS there were talking to. So let's say you have two two students and one is a member and one is a non member. They log in, they get to their, to their equivalent of this page, right? And so, you know, because one is a member, they get to see certain content that the non member doesn't but let's say that there's a course that we're offering like I don't know a course and we want both of them to be able to participate in that course. Is that possible? Or are they sort of like in different instances and therefore won't be able to interact with each other?\nMATT\n13:49 \nSo, they'll always be within the same instance unless of course, you wanted to pay for multiple instances. I mean, we're happy to which.\nINGMAR\n13:56 \nThat's a conversation which we might want to do yeah.\nMATT\n14:00 \nSo, so think of it this way… everyone, is it like even if you present these different experiences, right? Like say, for example, if I log back out and I log back in as this non member profile that had the different interface and things like that, even if I do this, I am still in the same instance of Docebo as the same back end, but the content within it can be permission to queue up based on those data categories. So you could have some of it be hidden behind the membership wall where the members get access to this and only members. Some of it could be only non member if you wanted to. And then there could be like a happy medium in between like a gold lock zone where they get the, they get, this is for everyone. It doesn't matter if you remember or non member. This is for you.\nINGMAR\n14:42 \nSo here's because you touched on something which is a related question. So, you know, can we, because we have enterprise clients. So we are, we create learning manager, you know, we create instances for them currently on Thinkific that is fully customized to them because they want their own branding on it. How would we do that with you? Would we have to have a separate instance or could it be in one instance? But just the log in takes them into a completely different branded sort of section if you will.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matt and Ingmar discussed integrating resources into a Docebo page with the option to iFrame some elements if needed.\n• Ingmar asked if it was possible to have two students (one a member, one non-member) interact with each other in the same instance; Matt confirmed that this is achievable through permission queuing based on data categories.\n• Ingmar then asked about creating an instance for enterprise clients with their own branding; Matt acknowledged that this could be done through a separate instance or by having the log in take users to a section branded to them within one instance.

{"prompt":"MATT\n15:17 \nSo we, so we can have it all be part of the same instance, but just branded differently.\nPayment Gateway ends\nMATT\n15:22 \nSo think of it this way if it gets to the point where you see the like the purple bar here, does the purple have a name or is it okay if I just call it purple?\nINGMAR\n15:32 \nPurple.\nMATT\n15:33 \nOkay. Because some people are very protective of their call talk to.\nINGMAR\n15:38 \nThe agency that helped us with this, they'll probably, they probably would. But.\nEMILY\n15:43 \nThink of.\nMATT\n15:44 \nIt this way purple bar and above… out of the box functionality, you can influence everything below it and have it be company specific so that when somebody logs in, you can put a banner here that's still like that.\nLayout & Content\nMATT\n15:58 \nThat's their logo says, you know… like welcome abc company, right? And then you could have a scenario where you just design and in platform experience for them. But the Fluence logo would still be at the top here if you don't want that. If it has to be even their logo at the top, we can still do that.\nPayment Gateway\nMATT\n16:18 \nIt just costs money. So we have an additional piece of software or a piece of software. An additional feature. It's called extended enterprise. I actually built out just a quick example of it. So say, for example, like I just have like non member here and it's still forking off of the same URL, it's just, they get their.\nPricing\nINGMAR\n16:39 \nGot it. Got it.\nMATT\n16:41 \nWith their own branding on top of.\nINGMAR\n16:43 \nHow much does that cost? Is that or is that sort of a complicated?\nEMILY\n16:47 \nNo, it's not complicated at all. So basically, we sell them in packs of five up to like a certain point for the lowest for the like zero to five. So you would have up to five domains that you could use for that. That's the lowest one that we sell. And it is, give me just a second. My internet is taking forever, 10,700 dollars a year.\nINGMAR\n17:13 \nOkay.\nMATT\n17:15 \nStill all administered off the same back end.\nUser Permission\nMATT\n17:18 \nLike any permission wise. Like, so for the member, the non member, the individual company and enterprise company all administers off the back end, all feeds the same admin reporting. It just creates a little like little fee them within the little section of the platform and you could do things like hand like, you know, sub administrative access to those people so that, you know, they can see their own grades, their own data, their own self reports, things like that. But you as the super admin still control everything as part of your larger domain. And it all appears here. Like as an admin, I can actually see. So like that domain just happens to be tied to like this particular section of like external and internal and stuff like that as an admin, I see all of it. If they were to log in as what we call that Power user, they would only see one.\nUser Permission ends\nINGMAR\n18:02 \nAwesome. Okay, cool. This is great.\nMATT\n18:06 \nNo worries. VILT, thank you for asking the questions because like if I just talk for an hour, it's really bad for.\nINGMAR\n18:11 \nYou're engaged? Yeah… cool. Well.\nMATT\n18:18 \nWhat else we can help?\nJENNIFER\n18:19 \nA sample of a video like a video less and I know we were thinking about potentially go react, still rating more. Is that still on the…\nLearning Plans\nINGMAR\n18:26 \nYeah, I just a refresher, do you do support lti? Is that?\nMATT\n18:31 \nYes, we do support LT.\nINGMAR\n18:33 \nThe way you'll see what you've got your.\nMATT\n18:35 \nThat go react would work is like, so I'll pop into what we call a learning plan here before we hop into the course. I just wanted to show this is optional. You do not have to do this. Courses can 100 percent be completely standalone, but it sounded like you might have like certifications and stuff like that. Like progress. So I thought I would show that. Hey, we track progress at the course level, the individual level. But if you want to group all that together as a larger curricular outcome, you can excellent.\nLearning Plans ends\nMATT\n19:02 \nSo let's jump into like the E learning course though. Like, so for example, like videos, things like that, people that are going to be taking them on their own. And so just a normal video MP for style video here's, like you just load it up. If it'll play it'll, do things like, you know, if I make it halfway through the video, it'll remember that. And if I leave it's okay. And then if I come back, it'll remember where?\nJENNIFER\n19:25 \nOkay. That's nice. That's very nice.\nMATT\n19:28 \nYou can control whether or not they fast forward like what I just did here so that if you wanna make sure that they watch the entire video or you can just watch it the first time after that, they can fast forward. You've got options like that. Okay? We will only market complete when they've hit either the last 15 seconds or the last 10 percent, whichever one is larger. I'm sorry, whichever one is smaller. Sorry.\nINGMAR\n19:53 \nSo I see that there is, I see that you can embed a video, YouTube and the video that you're on currently that's one where the videos can be also uploaded to your.\nMATT\n20:04 \nYes. Yeah. Think of it this way. This is from YouTube. It's like hosted on YouTube. We just use an integration to bring it in also by the way you'll notice it remembered were the last time I was in here, this one, this video file, this is an MP four file. It has been uploaded into do table and lives in within… our inventory. I guess you got.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Matt and the team discussed Extended Enterprise.\n• Matt also discussed learning plans.  END"}
{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n20:25 \nWould our content be stored on your end or our end in our end server? How does that work on with you?\nEMILY\n20:30 \nQuestion?\nMATT\n20:32 \nIf you're uploading it, it's going to be part of our server but stuff like the lti integration that's gonna be, that's gonna live with them exactly. Well, I the.\nJENNIFER\n20:44 \nSo our content library, that kind of stuff like does it have to be with you? Some clients have their own content repository of their own because I know that we have tons of videos and it probably would be better for us to keep our hands on our own videos. I don't know how that might, how does that all work?\nIntegrations ends\nEMILY\n21:03 \nWell, Matt, let's dive into not only the like functionality, we need to dive into tracking and size limits.\nMATT\n21:13 \nOkay. So I'll tell you what, let's take this over to. So this is the course, like we're looking at a course called starting with the basics. I'm gonna hop over to the admin side to talk about this. Okay? And I'm gonna come to course management and so…\nJENNIFER\n21:26 \nThat's cool. Fine. Happy to see this page. Thank you.\nMATT\n21:33 \nBy the way, Emily and I are both former cat as well educators. So we feel your pain with the d2l and the black boards and the stuff like that… under this training material tab. This is where I get my opportunities to determine what goes into the course. So I've got this one broken down into these little like sections. You don't have to do this. I did it because I loaded one of every resource into the platform. And that can look a little intimidating on a demo. So I can break this down by the individual folders here. But say, for example, like I'm in this folder and I want to add a new video. Well, at this point, I can just click on add training material. And I get the now the choice of uploading a file launching like a screen recorder, like built screen or embedding the file from YouTube. And so in this case, like think of these first two options, we take the file, it lives within our architecture. We use a content delivery network that spread out across Amazon web services.\nJENNIFER\n22:36 \nNice. Okay. Yeah.\nMATT\n22:38 \nSo, in terms of that, like we're gonna like take that video file and it does get replicated across the CDN.\nAbout Docebo\nMATT\n22:45 \nSo just in terms of like access, so that if like someone in Europe is trying to access that, they're not going all the way to north to a server in North America to get it there. Although your database, however, we can guarantee data residency. So we can, if you want your database in the United States and no one's data leaves there, we can guarantee that.\nAbout Docebo ends\nMATT\n23:03 \nOkay. But like things like the embedded video that is held and operated by like YouTube, vimeo, wise, we never actually get the source file. We just embed it.\nJENNIFER\n23:16 \nOkay, great. I was, the question is I feel like there's probably additional costs around how much content you keep on the platform.\nMATT\n23:26 \nActually use it. So, but Emily brought up a good point. There is an individual file limit. So the individual files themselves. So like if I upload a video file has to be under a gigabyte. Okay?\nINGMAR\n23:40 \nYeah. I think, I mean, we have a production, we have a content studio as well as a like a director producer person.\nIntegrations\nINGMAR\n23:47 \nAnd so we can ask him, I'm sure these are things that he's familiar with in terms of getting the resolution of the content… compressed to a way that will work. I don't think that will be an issue. We can check with him.\nMATT\n24:01 \nOftentimes what we find is in this, we're with modern content construction, we're rarely finding scenarios where videos are longer than 10 minutes.\nIntegrations ends\nMATT\n24:12 \nIt just seems like just people don't do it because like it's really tough like YouTube is amazing for its educational capabilities, but it's really ruining attention spans.\nINGMAR\n24:24 \nYeah, not to mention tick tack, but.\nEMILY\n24:27 \nI just say.\nINGMAR\n24:28 \nYeah. Yeah. I mean, we are in a place where we do have like demonstrations of psychotherapy sessions that go to for like 30 minutes. So, yeah.\nEMILY\n24:39 \nNot, would those?\nJENNIFER\n24:40 \nWill be on vimeo, though, right? Ingmar, this would be on our side.\nINGMAR\n24:43 \nBe on vimeo. Yeah, I think I should check with, I need to check with Rob who manages our studio.\nMATT\n24:50 \nI like 30 minutes at 10 adp is not gonna go over a gigabyte, 30 minutes at four K.\nJENNIFER\n25:00 \nThere's like an hour long, and one of the clearvoyance where they go like start to finish. I think some of the content is an hour, but the content that seems to be lost on YouTube or somewhere else. Yeah.\nINGMAR\n25:12 \nYeah, split it up in the worst, you know?\nMATT\n25:15 \nOftentimes what we'll find is that in these cases where people do wind up coming into the system with like one gigabyte files, this is a good opportunity for you to do some like pedagogical examination of resources and then say, should I split it here? And then what people will do is they'll split it and then they'll do things like throw a little quiz in between section.\nJENNIFER\n25:33 \nWe've been talking about that, yeah.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jennifer asked about content storage and LTIs, and Emily and Matt discussed integrations.\n• Ingmar mentioned they have a production studio to help manage file resolution and length, with Emily adding longer videos can be split up into sections. END"}
{"prompt":"EMILY\n30:51 \nWhat they might be asking about too is like just seeing content that's not in, of course, like, you know, catalogs and channels. That is what we saw earlier. So to be very clear if you want things in a course gonna look like this. If you want just some of these pieces separate or additional pieces that are not in this course like on their own.\nCoach & Share\nEMILY\n31:16 \nAnd folks can literally just click into them kinda similar to how it's already set up on your website right now, then that would be more when you would use a catalog or a channel. So those little things right here, the industry knowledge helpful, you could totally, okay. And you can, those can be delivered like the visibility on these is highly configurable and flexible. So like your members could see certain channels where you're non members don't have access to those.\nCoach & Share ends\nMATT\n31:41 \nYeah, for example, if this page is set up where it's like, hey, show these catalogs or show these channels depending as to who logs in, they might have the same page, but they see different things because it analyzes the permission structure when they log in.\nJENNIFER\n31:55 \nSo, like for example, if my academy certificate program versus a collision program student, my industry knowledge, my helpful resource will all be different but they'll still be the same headers. I got you. That makes sense.\nMATT\n32:06 \nI feel so bad now, I've been pronouncing it academy in the whole time.\nJENNIFER\n32:10 \nYou…\nMATT\n32:12 \nOkay.\nJENNIFER\n32:13 \nThis, I…\nINGMAR\n32:13 \nThink it is, yeah.\nEMILY\n32:15 \nMar, you're the expert.\nJENNIFER\n32:16 \nSo he is certainly the expert.\nMATT\n32:21 \nI was, so I was so worried for a sec because I was just like.\nJENNIFER\n32:23 \nYou good.\nEMILY\n32:24 \nOkay. Well, how often are you talking about Katie?\nJENNIFER\n32:30 \nI…\nMATT\n32:31 \nI've never been on a call with an expert before, but.\nEMILY\n32:33 \nRight. Cool.\nMATT\n32:37 \nSo just in terms of, in terms of the setup on, there's a couple of other things that I wanted to showcase with this while we're still talking about setup though. The first one being under add training material here is your L ti. So all that's involved is that from this, you just get given a title but you do need the information from the source. So if this is like a video that exists on, so, sorry, I keep wanting to say, go react. Thank you because like react now is a programming language. So, but for go react with their L ti, they'll just have to give you like the URL and the credentials to be able to get people access to. But that's where it comes from. The other thing about these files that's really nifty is that when you edit these, there is also the section for additional information where you can take these. And so what this does is it exposes not just the course but the individual materials that make up the course to the global search engine. So that if anyone is ever coming here as like after training. And they just type in keywords into the search engine and do a search, it will surface not just the just not the, not just the course information but the individual.\nJENNIFER\n33:47 \nIt's actually really good. So I can think of examples like forms that we might provide to students to be able to use in practice like an informed consent form or practical forms, you know, those types of things. Or maybe I mean, there's just a number of ways. So that makes a lot of sense.\nEMILY\n34:03 \nAlso, another thing to note about this is that even you see how here it surfaces material that is tagged as training because that's what we search. However something else to kind of keep in the back of your mind is, I know you have a lot of video content. It will actually the AI can actually pull videos where the word as mentioned even if it's not tagged or in the… that's super cool. Now that question for them. Because I wanna be super clear here if they are hosting their videos in demo, but like linking to them from Docebo. Would that still work?\nMATT\n34:40 \nNo, we don't get to crawl that unfortunately because.\nJENNIFER\n34:43 \nYeah, yeah. Okay.\nMATT\n34:45 \nYeah. We need the source file to crawl it.\nINGMAR\n34:52 \nI have another question for you. This one is like totally, it's okay if this is not a functionality you have, but I would like to ask, is there such a thing where students could create like their own profile and then somehow interact with each other or see each other or something like that?\nMATT\n35:11 \nSo there is a location. So one of the things that Emily mentioned earlier, the channels is a place where students can interact with one another. There's never going to be a scenario and it's just for completely for privacy reasons where they'd be able to view each other's profiles.\nUser Permission\nMATT\n35:26 \nBut like say, for example, like I've got a section here that's just helpful resources, me, and this is as a learner profile by the way. So the admins over here, this is a learner, I can come in and take a look at some of these resources that are already here.\nCoach & Share\nMATT\n35:41 \nAnd then there's like a little like comment and Q in a sections down below where we can participate and go. A few go like a couple of levels deep on. It's not like a red it forum. It is more of a like a it's closer to a Facebook than a read it where there's like a post with a resource and then conversation can surround it, right? But you can open this up so that the learners themselves can share links, share files, record their screens and share their own materials in here to create the post in the first place, which is then exposed to anyone else that has access to the same channel, of course.\nINGMAR\n36:17 \nSo if we wanted to.\nJENNIFER\n36:17 \nSo in groups that might work, it is okay.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Emily and team discussed how content can be delivered through separate catalogs and channels, with visibility being highly configurable and flexible based on user permissions. \n• Ingmar asks if students can create profiles and interact with each other; Matt explains that though profiles cannot be viewable, users can share materials in channels under their learner profile.

{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n48:07 \nWith canvas, it was the same with canvas. In order to get the push Notifications, you had to have the app. So there's a, because that we were trying to figure out, was it even worth telling people about this free app? Would it be confusing to send them to the web or send them here? I'm very clear with people about why you would want the app on your phone and it's for that kind of thing like shoot, I forgot. I have.\nEMILY\n48:28 \nThat…\nJENNIFER\n48:29 \nKind of, yeah.\nEMILY\n48:31 \nYes, exactly.\nMATT\n48:33 \nSo SMS is possible through API integrations. But again, anytime you do that, there is like cost. So, but this is just an example of what the app looks like in terms of a push note, like just on his phone? Like this, was it telling me that, hey, you know, here's stuff I, to do. So, yes.\nJENNIFER\n48:53 \nI'd love as much Automation on that from the system as possible.\nMobile App ends\nJENNIFER\n48:56 \nBut yeah, we can, we could use Hubspot for like direct texting. And right now, I'm using Google voice for that. So. Okay.\nMATT\n49:04 \nNice. We're getting about the 10 minute mark and I know Jennifer like from the last call reporting in visibility was one of the, so I wanna make sure… that we get into this because I know this is a, this is a big deal.\nCustom Reports\nMATT\n49:19 \nThere's two types of reports in our system, the premade ones, which is what we're looking at right here. And then we have custom reports. Think of it as like the premade ones are like, you know, pretty charts and graphs and, you know, like navigable custom reports can get you a better data set, but they come as an excel spreadsheet.\nJENNIFER\n49:38 \nI was gonna ask you that, can I run a quick summary report and then export to excel if it's already a standard report you have in here?\nMATT\n49:45 \nFor sure. So actually like you can just come to this courses dashboard and then there's a, there's an export to excel.\nCustom Reports ends\nJENNIFER\n49:50 \nYeah, perfect.\nEMILY\n49:51 \nThank you.\nMATT\n49:52 \nSo go ahead and apply like you could say, like just show me this organization. Just show me that organization. You could say, just show me the last three months. Anytime you make one of these filterable changes, it'll change the data set here and it'll also change what you download.\nJENNIFER\n50:05 \nCan I ask you, are you able to… we did this through another system that's why I'm not sure if you could do it in the LMS, we did it through a student information system or is we were able to cap enrollments so that people could not put too many students in a class?\nCourse Enrollment\nJENNIFER\n50:22 \nAnd then also, we would be notified that class has reached its maximum. And that is again, something we did in the sis and I'm just trying to find out, is that something we'd have to build in Hubspot? Or can we do it in here?\nMATT\n50:34 \nSo if it's a, so the E learning, we don't enforce a maximum but for the Instructor led, yes, each of the individual ones, any time that there's like a specific date and the time you can enforce a.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nJENNIFER\n50:47 \nSo, Ingmar, this is a really big problem we're having right now with courses is you'll have somebody go in and register for that single course, say understanding Cato, me and then you have your people that are coming into the certificate program who also need understanding admin on the same day. And I mean kinda mean on the same day, but they're coming in from a program as opposed to a single course purchase. So, I'm tracking certificate people, someone else is tracking those single courses and together they have to meet and it's manual right now. So I don't I always, I'm a little nervous.\nCourse Enrollment\nJENNIFER\n51:22 \nI always want to check my spreadsheets to see. Is this class already full? Because if so, you can't offer this particular Cohort in this progression. Do you know what I mean? This?\nINGMAR\n51:32 \nYes.\nEMILY\n51:32 \nYeah.\nMATT\n51:33 \nYeah, set the maximum and you also have access to or there's a checkup a button here as well for like wanna wait.\nJENNIFER\n51:42 \nYes, we definitely do. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Okay.\nMATT\n51:48 \nNo worries. So, yeah, the E learnings, we don't enforce a maximum on like they like if there's going to be 10,000 of them in the E learning, but they're going through it at their own pace anyway. So it's generally not a, but yes, for the, any time it's going to be like an Instructor involved, you can set a maximum that they can, that they can jump into.\nNext Steps\nJENNIFER\n52:08 \nOkay. We'd like to, I know we're out of time. I'd really take one more time and look at this stuff. Maybe if that's possible in a separate you.\nEMILY\n52:16 \nTook the words right out of my mouth. Usually when we get down to this section and we only have like 10 minutes left. I say let's just book another call. I mean.\nNext Steps ends\nJENNIFER\n52:27 \nThat's okay with you guys?\nEMILY\n52:28 \nOut.\nJENNIFER\n52:29 \nMy…\nEMILY\n52:31 \nCalls, we don't care, we can do whatever you need.\nMATT\n52:37 \nAnd if you want one of those calls to be me giving you like an idea of what to play around with in here and you come in and test out the reporting.\nJENNIFER\n52:43 \nThat's actually what I'm referring to kind of because then I can go in and look for, okay, well, when this happens, because scenarios user stories is what I call them from like a project management where I think about how a student will reach out to me and have a problem and how we can make it better or fix it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jennifer needed to find a way to limit enrollments in courses.\n• Matt offered an alternative solution of using Hubspot and setting a maximum for instructor-led sessions.\n• Emily and Matt suggested booking a separate call for further exploration into the system's capabilities, including testing custom reports and playing around with scenarios in the system.

{"prompt":"JENNIFER\n53:01 \nAnd I think that, you know, you can kinda see that as you start to look through what resources are available and moving things around. If you start to look at some of this data analytics, you can figure out where people are like kinda dropping off like we have people disappear from the school and it would be at a quite time in the course. This data shows you that. And then you can kind of course correct because, you know, what's going on in your own classes. Do you track faculty activity? Can you run faculty reports or not so much?\nMATT\n53:30 \nOr what the instructors are doing and things like that or, so, yeah, we don't have a ton of visibility on the instructors themselves.\nCourse Enrollment\nMATT\n53:36 \nWe often integrate with another system to do that where it's just like, hey, this person has taught, you know, 36 hours over the last.\nJENNIFER\n53:43 \nThe, they'll go full time or something. We don't want that comes.\nMATT\n53:47 \nSo, yeah, we don't have a ton of like Instructor management capabilities within the platform, yeah of like time.\nJENNIFER\n53:53 \nYou're giving us some things we don't have that will allow for more of that sort of time. And I understand that there are some integrations for faculty management that can.\nMATT\n54:04 \nTraining orchestra is the main one that we work with advantage is another one. So, but like the training orchestra, it's free. It's out of the box. And that has like essentially like people tend to manage the instructors and like the times of the ILT and stuff like that in that software. And then we just get the end result through the integration.\nJENNIFER\n54:22 \nOkay. So why that works for us? I think why I feel like we could use something like that is because we have a lot of adjunct, we're onboarding a lot of adjunts some of them won't teach for a while. Do you know what I mean? And I, I've heard from another LMS that there is an integration you can get that will actually allow that Instructor to put in their availability over like the next year and then it can help you schedule them out. And that is because we're starting certificate programs.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nJENNIFER\n54:46 \nNow, those courses run for like eight or nine months. So we need to book out as far as we can and, you know, have people kinda lined up. So that would be a quick and easy way for us to see. Is this person going to be able to teach? So that's something I would, you know, I don't know how much these things cost, but it is something I think that will make our lives a lot easier like you have to hire humans or you get your knowledge to do it that's…\nEMILY\n55:09 \nAbsolutely well. And I feel like to like Matt, you just listed off, you know, the training orchestra, those options after you all dig into some of those. Like we can totally if you get, you know, access to like a platform like a sandbox or some sort of we can play around as much as.\nJENNIFER\n55:28 \nSo that was training orchestra.

Now. I just remember that. So my apologies.\nEMILY\n56:55 \nAre…\nINGMAR\n56:56 \nYou all on the east coast?\nEMILY\n56:58 \nWe are.\nINGMAR\n56:59 \nOkay, great. We are too. So, my availability is on Monday. I could either do in the morning between like nine and 11 or I could do a or four PM. What Jennifer is that?\nJENNIFER\n57:12 \nNine to 10, if nine to 10 is okay. That don't work?\nINGMAR\n57:16 \nTo…\nEMILY\n57:16 \nMe. Yeah, great time with me. All right. So, Monday morning at nine o'clock…\nJENNIFER\n57:22 \nThank you guys.\nEMILY\n57:23 \nAre we doing? What are we doing?\nINGMAR\n57:25 \nBut that's what?\nJENNIFER\n57:30 \nI love it. I.\nEMILY\n57:32 \nI am. And Lucas, you know, normally, we would only book like 30 minutes to go through like the admin side alone, but I feel like we need an hour so we can.\nNotifications\nINGMAR\n57:43 \nA few more questions I'd like to ask.\nEMILY\n57:45 \nYeah. Yeah. So first of all, you can send over via email or save them until the next call. Okay. Yeah.\nINGMAR\n57:53 \nYeah, I'll send that over email, but.\nJENNIFER\n57:55 \nYou can rattle them all off right now because you're being for.\nINGMAR\n57:58 \nOne thing I just want to say is, please, can you as soon as we're done, send me, I like that a deck or those images you had of the different ways you customize the homepage.\nWrap-Up\nEMILY\n58:07 \nYep. Any.\nINGMAR\n58:08 \nKind of images you can and stuff you can send me so I can share with my team would be really helpful.\nEMILY\n58:13 \nYeah, absolutely. Yes, I will send you even more than what we showed you. We have real life.\nINGMAR\n58:19 \nPerfect. That's great.\nEMILY\n58:21 \nYeah, for sure. Yeah. Okay. Cool.\nCourse Enrollment\nMATT\n58:24 \nDo you guys have a Zoom account by any chance? Yeah. Okay. They're actually. So if you, if you're ever wondering what it's like to be like a learner and a Docebo platform? Sorry, let me just grab a window here.\nEMILY\n58:36 \nThinking, Matt, I know where you're going?\nMATT\n58:38 \nSo, if you ever just wanted like test it out, Zoom is a client. So just go ahead, click on, sign in, create like if you have a Zoom account, they will allow you to jump into the Zoom learning center and just like start learning. So this will give you an idea of what it's like to be a learner in the system?\nWrap-Up\nJENNIFER\n58:56 \nFantastic.\nMATT\n58:57 \nThe admin capabilities.\nEMILY\n59:02 \nPerfect. All right.\nJENNIFER\n59:03 \nTime everyone.\nINGMAR\n59:05 \nThank you so much.\nEMILY\n59:07 \nThis is fantastic. You'll ask such good questions and we enjoy talking to you, so it's our pleasure.\nJENNIFER\n59:11 \nYou too. You too. Thank you.\nEMILY\n59:13 \nWe'll talk to you Monday, thanks.\nJENNIFER\n59:15 \nBye.\nEMILY\n59:16 \nBye of.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jennifer, Matt, Emily and Ingmar discussed resources available to track faculty activity and data analytics.\n• They discussed the use of an integration system that would allow for scheduling adjuncts over an eight or nine month period.\n• Training Orchestra and Administrate were mentioned as suitable solutions that could be used.\n• They also discussed the need for images of customized homepages and that Zoom could be used to understand learner experience on the platform.\n• They scheduled a meeting for Monday morning at 9am to discuss next steps.

{"prompt":"DRUE\n5:10 \nYeah, absolutely. Okay. I was just curious the back story on these considerations and we'll work through them just as matter of factly, as much as possible to the ones that we can address. And then any of the ones that we can address directly. We can always Loop in our legal team as well, okay? Per.\nBRETT\n5:32 \nPerfect. Appreciate that. Yeah.\nJOE\n5:37 \nSo, Brett, just going down the line here, the first one that one's easy for us to fix. Obviously, I put the dates that we had talked on originally, but you and I can put whatever date needs to be on the actual contract itself. So I wanna make sure that that's kind of what you're asking there and just understanding if that's the.\nBRETT\n5:56 \nYes. And I think it might be in here twice unless it's the, very well it might be in here twice. I thought, I remember reading it twice what John had stated. And because he deals with these and then it kinda makes sense. He's like wait, you're going to have like a 12 week, you know, launch period basically.\nPricing\nBRETT\n6:15 \nAnd so you don't have full access to the platform or whatever. But your contract starts like that three months before he's like we can't even use it, but we're paying for it. He's like that doesn't make any sense if you say it out loud, it doesn't even make sense. I was like, yeah, correct. Yeah, you're correct?\nOnboarding\nJOE\n6:30 \nSo, yeah. And just so you're fully kind of understanding of that as well. You do have access to the system day one actually, which is important to say the onboarding process is going to help you get it kind of in the Shape that you guys are looking towards. But at the same time, you'll actually have access to start using the system day one and that's really easy to start building learning plans, whatever it is that you need to do so that you're actually rolling it out like we talked on of like a soft launch at any point during the onboarding process. So the start date itself, Andrew if you have anything else to share on that, which is helpful is typically the start date, the start date for when we go live with the contract just because especially you have access to the system out the gate, I guess is the best way to put.\nOnboarding ends\nBRETT\n7:19 \nOkay. But it doesn't do us any good if we don't know how to use it. I think that's what John, his point was. He's like great you guys can use it. But if you don't know how to use it and you're not, and it's not you, it's not really being utilized as the online training platform that we want, then why are you paying for it yet?\nPricing\nBRETT\n7:36 \nAnd because I don't think it's not about the cost but it's about when does that cost start? So that we're not, you know what I mean? We're not losing two to three months worth of our first year.\nJOE\n7:47 \nYeah, for sure. Drew anything to add on that? I'm curious if you've had that question come up before on start date versus onboarding?\nDRUE\n7:55 \nNo, it's just very much. So what Joe said in regards to as soon as you sign a contract, you technically do have access to the system. And so within a matter of two to three days, you could go ahead and start assigning courses. And so it's industry standard just that you are build right away upfront plus an implementation fee.\nOnboarding\nBRETT\n8:22 \nOkay.\nJOE\n8:25 \nSo I'm happy to like let's kind of ensure that you have exactly what you need ama wise to go back, question wise, but you let me kinda know how we take each question from here.\nBRETT\n8:39 \nHang on a second.\nBRETT\n8:48 \nAnd then when I talk to him, if something is different, then I'll make sure that I clarify for you guys as well. Yeah. And I mean, I'm hoping because it's not that we're that we don't want to move forward. That's for sure. It's just again he's just making sure what he does, where is where his expertise lies? Is this? So he's just making sure that we're getting off to the right start. So.\nJOE\n9:13 \nI'm with you. I'm with you. I don't wanna make sure you guys are comfortable too.\nDRUE\n9:16 \nAnd just to like again preface this conversation by saying we deal with different types of considerations questions, suggestions all the time to our msa and our overall business processes, but we're not really flexible with them.\nOnboarding ends\nDRUE\n9:29 \nSo I just want to be very transparent about that. If we seem very matter of fact, it's because that is our msa. Neither Joe or I have poll on that. There are a couple that might be a little bit more negotiable, I would say, but we'll cross that Bridge when we get there, but I just don't want you to feel like we're being very matter of fact, but it really is a matter of fact.\nBRETT\n9:50 \nNo, but no, but you just understand it goes both ways basically as being the customer super easy for us to say, hey, thanks, but no, thanks too. So.\nDRUE\n9:59 \nAbsolutely. And so we, and that's definitely something I hope we don't get there but that might be, if we don't come to common terms, then that could be.\nBRETT\n10:09 \nYeah. And I wouldn't take it personal by any means and Joe is amazing. It's been an amazing partner so far helping me get this going. So.\nJOE\n10:17 \nWell, I wouldn't take it personal either. I think you and I obviously need to be on the same page and I'm with you there.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Brett raised an issue about pricing and onboarding, wanting to clarify when costs start in order not to lose two to three months worth of the first year.\n• Joe mentioned that customers would have access to the system immediately after signing the contract, but data suggests it might take two to three days for onboarding. \n• They all agreed that the customer should understand the MSA terms and conditions and be aware that they are not flexible. END"}
{"prompt":"JOE\n10:21 \nSo, yeah, cool. But going down the line here, let's look. So three year contract, this was brought up a couple of times in this as comments. So the pricing that you and I were able to work on that's the hard part and that's where we're gonna fall outside of your budget of keeping it under 20 K a year, like we talked on because giving you a three year contract, if we looked at the overall discount, it sat, I think like 39 percent through if I'm not mistaken… which a one year option, we don't have pricing discount options at hand. Therefore it puts us way over the 20 K per year price tag. So there's a few aspects that kinda go into play there reading into this of reducing it to a one year contract. We're happy to entertain that. But the problem is I see is going over your budget. So I just wanted your take on that.\nBRETT\n11:19 \nWhat is the year by year contract price? You know?\nJOE\n11:22 \nI do. Yeah. I actually looked it up this morning just to make sure I was in the no 24 K per year would be the one year price. And as it stands for you guys right now, you're right around what 17 and a half I think is what we had it reduced down to.\nBRETT\n11:40 \nAnd then, and also the first year would still be that implementation fee, correct?\nJOE\n11:44 \nAnd that's the other thing that I wanted to talk on through here as well, right? Because yes, very much. So, which was out of the box. It's 5,500, but we discounted that down, right? To try to fit it within that first year for you. So we applied a heavier discount upfront on year one to kind of fit. And that is, and Drew brought this up as well in conversation of that Docebo onboarding light, right? Which is that shorter period. And the reason we did that obviously was price constraints.\nOnboarding\nJOE\n12:15 \nBut we may based around some of the concerns of onboarding, want to look at what the full onboarding process looks like. If you wanted to go towards goals onboarding, which is more, you know, handholding potentially a longer period. If you want to spend some more time with an onboarding coach. It's just not something we geared towards the first time through here because it just… the scope of what you guys are actually doing is fairly simple, right?\nBRETT\n12:42 \nYeah.\nJOE\n12:42 \nReally necessary except for the obviously helping you guys get up and running. So, so a couple of ways we can look at that, the price obviously increases if we go towards the full onboarding experience as well.\nPricing\nJOE\n12:54 \nSo, but I can give you that pricing as well. That sits at 13,000 for the onboarding. It's 13,080 dollars to be exact, get it here. So.\nBRETT\n13:06 \nWith what, like I said, with what you and I agreed on, I don't think that the onboarding needs to be higher than that level for sure.\nPricing ends\nBRETT\n13:15 \nIf Gothic already had something in place, there was anything besides an excel spreadsheet… or manuals that we've printed. I might say, yeah, we might need some of this but we don't at this time.\nJOE\n13:27 \nYeah. And one thing I thought was helpful at least was bringing up, I'm gonna send this to you. I'll put it as one of the go backs is I'm not sure if I send this to you yet. Let me share my screen.\nJOE\n13:44 \nJust the time line which breaks down the onboarding a little bit better for you. I think so. If this is kind of some ammo for you to go back of what that schedule looks like, did I send this to you yet by chance?\nBRETT\n13:57 \nI don't know if you sent this like this format, but you did send a timeline, but I don't think it was as detailed as this.\nJOE\n14:03 \nI'll send this to you just so you have it just because it might help you guys in preparation as well just in getting set.\nPricing\nJOE\n14:10 \nSo let's look down here to make sure we're covering all your points. So 300 active users, you and I had talked a lot on this. Go ahead. You had a question?\nBRETT\n14:26 \nI wouldn't say you told me that 300 is the minimum that you guys do exactly at your very bottom. And he didn't know that, and.\nPricing ends\nJOE\n14:32 \nTotally. Yeah.\nBRETT\n14:34 \nAgain, when he wrote this, remember, I hadn't we, it's not like he had sent these questions over. And then I hadn't given the wrong information. So he, okay.\nJOE\n14:42 \nI'm with you. I just wanna make sure that you're fully aware that is the minimum. So, so there is just no downgrade options in general, but he was talking about upgrade options throughout here.\nPricing\nJOE\n14:54 \nWe're happy to entertain that at any point. Drue, I know you're able to speak on that a lot better than I could… but again, I'm not sure how building it into the contract, how necessary that would be for your time frame of things on what we talked on just because obviously even at 300, you were slightly below that. So it gave you some cushion towards Growth is kind of how we talked on it last at least.\nBRETT\n15:18 \nYeah. I think he's more worried about or what's not spelled out. Is that next box down there? The active users? Yep. And again, I think Joe you covered this with me. It's only people that are actually going in and doing the entry. It's not the people that are listed as like I think I call them an observer or something like that from another platform that then we can still send stuff too. But if…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Joe and Brett discussed a three-year contract, but the pricing puts them over their budget so they are now looking at reducing it to a one-year option instead. \n• The one-year contract price is $24K per year. \n• An implementation fee of $5,500 is included in the first year's fee, with discount applied to fit into the budget.  END"}
{"prompt":"JOE\n15:42 \nYeah, yeah. So they're not marked as an active user until they're physically logging in to consume content. So there was some question around. He almost made it sound more like towards the licensing model of a per head that's sitting in the system. It won't be that way for you guys. So, okay. So that person's still in the system, they're still active as a user, but it's not marking them as a monthly active user until they're logging in to consume content within that given month? Okay? So… are there any other questions on kind of the monthly active user versus license model? Like we talked on, I'm just kinda curious if that kind of answers that for you based around because he specifically said active concurrent users versus active named users and it would be active named users in that case, just because they're physically associated with a log in that's keeping track of when they're logging into the system as that user, I guess.\nPricing ends\nBRETT\n16:42 \nOkay… cool. I did like his math that he did on the next point?\nJOE\n16:51 \nYeah. And Drew, you might be more helpful to talk on this one. But this is, I'm not sure if it's more helpful if I share my screen on the spreadsheet we're looking at, I know we're all looking at it together. But let me do that. Just so Drew sees it too.\nPricing\nJOE\n17:08 \nRight? Can you see my screen? I think.\nBRETT\n17:11 \nI can. Yeah, yeah.\nJOE\n17:12 \nOkay. So Drew this point here about added… essentially the overage rates I think is what we're getting at, right? Any additional users above the original? Yeah. So I guess first and foremost, and this is where we were talking on kind of like 300 being kind of a padded number for you. Anyway, do you first of all, see yourself going over 300 per month on any given month over the next three years is how I would ask it?\nBRETT\n17:42 \nI don't see us having the person active, three over 300 people actively using it per month. Now, there could be 450 people over the year that might log in and out, but it would be, you know, 200 in January that we've sent this training out. And then we're gonna do an next group of guys that will do another 150 or so in February or March, but they wouldn't be at the same time. So I just, is that, so are we still within our constraints if we're not doing it on a monthly basis or is it the yearly basis that we're gonna kinda look at?\nJOE\n18:16 \nNo, we're looking at the monthly basis, right? So, so that's where you have that flexibility and you're not gonna be over that overage like we were talking about.\nBRETT\n18:24 \nWe will not. But the math there is it because there's a discount for the for.\nJOE\n18:31 \nSo 590 is just our standard overage rate and Drew that's where I kinda need you kind of helping to speak on that.\nDRUE\n18:39 \nBrett, remind me how many employees do you guys have currently?\nBRETT\n18:45 \n1,867 as of today.\nDRUE\n18:47 \n1,867. Okay. And so it sounds like based on just the overall use case, it would not be even close to likely that you would go over 300 users per month. However if, for some reason you did, which would be very unlikely, our standard rate for an overage user is that five dollars and 90 cents, you will have an account manager tied to your account after you onboard. And one of their main goals is to your account and track different types of usage patterns on your account. So if you're trending towards over usage, if you're getting over 90 percent usage, they're going to be reaching out to you with the different options of, you know, does it make sense to upgrade your user account? Does it not, what's your usage strategy? So you'll have that option at any time, upgrade based on whatever that upgrade packages at that time, right? You would negotiate that at that time, but you can upgrade at any time.\nBRETT\n20:01 \nOkay. I think, I understand that very.\nDRUE\n20:05 \nI really don't think based on at least what I've seen here that you would go over 300… I.\nBRETT\n20:14 \nCan almost guarantee it, but there's we don't have, we don't have a department big enough to handle anybody that where we're doing 300 pieces of, you know what I mean of training or content or anything like getting that many people through in one month. There's just no way we don't have the time to do that. So.\nOnboarding\nDRUE\n20:31 \nAnd again, if you were getting close, then we would reach out to you proactively about overage. Okay?\nJOE\n20:43 \nNext thing on here was, are you good on that one?\nBRETT\n20:46 \nYeah, this is, yeah, this, and on this one because it's the same one.\nJOE\n20:50 \nYeah. So I'll send you that as well, which kind of breaks down the onboarding process a little better as well as this is very… attached to the msa, was the onboarding breakdown. So it does kinda speak a little more specifically. But what questions can we take away from these ones? At least?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Brett clarified they have 1,867 employees \n END"}
{"prompt":"BRETT\n21:22 \nI'll I, he didn't get that. So I'll send that to him. Okay?\nJOE\n21:28 \nLet me know if there's any go backs necessary on that. And if we need to explore, you know, further details and onboarding, we can probably provide more info as well. I can take that off line with you if we need to. Okay, it's just seen to be able to provide.\nBRETT\n21:47 \nYeah. What's so funny is that we can't we're not going to be able to do, we're not going to have the time to do more on boarding than what you guys are probably going to provide. So, I told you in the beginning that we needed a lot of hand holding because this is our first time doing this especially through Gothic. But again, I, I'm very confident that we're going to be okay?\nJOE\n22:08 \nYeah. And they're going to set you up for success and give you every resource you need especially through a lot of it self paced. So it doesn't even need to be handhold per SE, but they're going to point you in the right direction towards saying here's the best set of articles to read here's.\nOnboarding ends\nJOE\n22:21 \nThe best set of videos to watch that are really going to help you get set up from day one. There's like a boot camp you can go into for Docebo university that walks you through setup, right? So, so you're gonna go yourself on that.\nDRUE\n22:35 \nA majority of the cios that I've worked with could be comparing this on these onboarding services to something like an HRIS system or an active directory or a system, right? Like those are going to be very different onboarding versus our light onboarding. So he could be thinking a lot bigger than what this will entail but it's a great consideration.\nJOE\n23:07 \nFrom there, looking at this one. So this one, we kind of vetted this previously with obviously Patrick and book boon and whatnot, but we've kind of established we didn't need any special hours or anything like that for onboarding and that we've just try to connect book boon via either I frame or link to it, right? So with that being the case, we shouldn't need to provide an sow for any kind of data migration or anything like that. If you do want to go that route, we can definitely explore that. So just let me know if you want to explore that further. I'm just kinda curious just because I thought we had checked that off the boxes, not needing that essentially. But the wording is in the msa. I'm sure that's why he's asking about it.\nBRETT\n23:55 \nYeah. Yeah. He's just, he is, he's worried about, he's worried about scalability for us. And when we, what next steps look like is why he wrote that question. So.\nJOE\n24:07 \nOkay. Let me know. Does that kinda answer that for you at least based on what at least thinking back towards our conversations around book boom, that seemed to be the case?\nBRETT\n24:19 \nYeah. And again, he just does it, he does it. Yeah, he just doesn't want us to get ever caught with something that's not working. And then all of a sudden you guys, like he wrote in here, I know it may sound a bit absurd, but then you guys could charge 500 dollars an hour for someone to come out and try to fix something that we shouldn't have to worry about. I think is what is his comment was meant to be? So.\nIntegrations\nJOE\n24:41 \nYeah, Drew anything to add on that just especially with what we had already scoped out just kinda curious.\nDRUE\n24:48 \nThe only thing that comes to my, I've hardly ever seen that being needed unless we're talking about some very complex API that we don't have an already in house built API. If we had to like custom build an API for you to some foreign system that we hadn't worked with before. That's the only scenario I would see in which we would have to talk about any type of additional fees. But I just don't foresee that being an issue right now just because we have so many out of the box API system.\nIntegrations ends\nDRUE\n25:26 \nLike if we need to do that, yep, okay. For scalability, you know, are there any further plans that you guys have? Like connecting with a bunch of different systems down the line or?\nBRETT\n25:39 \nNo, what's really were, and maybe this is, this might be where John came from is that right now we have broken systems. Basically, we use Sage 300 for payroll one and HRIS. But there are like 14 different systems that try to talk to each other that to try to make things work. It has nothing to do with training and developer online training system. But I think maybe that might be some of the where he's hesitant. But our only thought process for the future is that we at some point are going to a platform either pay com or something like that. I'm assuming that would work very easily or you guys would work better with than what we're trying to deal with anyway. So I think future wise, it's probably even easier, not harder. So, yeah.\nIntegrations\nDRUE\n26:22 \nAgain, and that's very common right? From a lot of companies that we work with, getting systems to talk to each other, but because we have so many different APIs in like, you know, even if you were to switch systems, I mean, 99 percent confident we would already have an out of the box API to connect it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Joe and Drue discussed options for onboarding and integrating with a variety of systems. \n• Brett informed Joe and Drue that they might need more handholding due to lack of experience, but Joe reassured him that the necessary resources would be provided. \n• Joe assured Brett that further data migration would not be necessary as it had already been checked off the list. \n• When asked about scalability, Brett said the team's only plan for the future was to transition to a platform such as Paycom or something similar.

{"prompt":"DRUE\n26:43 \nYeah. So, so I don't think that this would be an issue for you guys if you can communicate that back to him, but we can always talk more. Got it.\nJOE\n26:56 \nAnd then the next one kind of reference almost back to the first point which is just correcting the order form based around obviously what we land on.\nOnboarding\nJOE\n27:06 \nBut the msa and Drew, maybe he'll speak on this. But what I have here is obviously the msa wording is still indicating the proposal as is as it stands within the MS.\nBRETT\n27:20 \nYeah.\nJOE\n27:20 \nYeah. I just have a note here that obviously we'll need to correct the order form ahead of time before signing.\nOnboarding ends\nJOE\n27:28 \nSo… looking down… let me scroll down here. Addendums are changeable by virtue of being link up. This is referencing our website addendums… to you. And I talked on this as well. Obviously if you know, this is how it is obviously with it. So we won't be able to change it. But if we need to get legal involved, I'm not sure, best practice there.\nIntegrations\nBRETT\n28:00 \nMaybe I can, I'll ask him for a little bit more clarification. I think this was the one I was like, I'm not sure what he means on this. I'll ask him if there's anything else.\nDRUE\n28:13 \nThing too. And I don't know how this fits in here but it's just to remind him that we don't hold any sensitive data within our system. To again, we're not an HRIS system. We don't have socials, we don't have really any sensitive data. So.\nJOE\n28:28 \nAnd the fact that we use Aws for storage anyway, we don't actually store… we're not storing your data, I guess is the best. I think that came up later on just trying to.\nBRETT\n28:43 \nIt's I don't know what it is. John is the most well, I guess you use you or we use the word sensitive.\nIntegrations ends\nBRETT\n28:50 \nHe's sensitive about that more than anybody else that anybody that I've worked with before. Like we just have to make sure we get, we don't want to be on the hook for everything that's been going on. In fact, we do it training every single month. There's quizzes that come out to everybody that has an email address, they have to do training and that kind of stuff. So he's overly sensitive. And yeah as he should be.\nAbout Docebo\nJOE\n29:15 \nYeah, to just to know that we obviously use the best of the best for storage of data being Aws, actually, they're one of our clients as well as what I would say. So I assume that's a public client. I think it's actually on our website, which is good.\nNext Steps\nJOE\n29:32 \nSo they're yeah, obviously a very secure network is what I would say. So, okay… support timeframe just for reference, it should be noted available from nine am to six PM Pacific Time. So, so there's a few points to this. I guess that gets around first of all your account manager.\nNext Steps ends\nJOE\n29:58 \nYou'll have access to a lot of different support options and even a point of contact directly that you'll work with. So most likely you'll be working with that individual, not on like our help desk hours, you know, like if you do need these emergency time frames, you can always open tickets for example. And we do have support globally, correct me if I'm wrong on that Drew. But if there's any kind of emergency situation, we should be able to address it in a timely manner.\nDRUE\n30:26 \nOr, yes, correct.\nJOE\n30:30 \nAnd just the standard support of what we're looking at here is us based says that means if users in Arizona want help, they're a bit limited to the time windows.\nAbout Docebo\nJOE\n30:40 \nSo, yeah, what I'd say is you probably don't need the help. We, I would reference our customer service reviews too is as a probably a good point of reference for him as well. And just our customer bank a WS that's probably a good example of some of our clients, right?\nAbout Docebo ends\nJOE\n30:57 \nWhere you can trust that they're obviously picking us for a reason. And the actual support hours itself are reflective of when we can help you obviously in that given day. But… yeah, any questions on that? I guess I wanna make sure.\nBRETT\n31:13 \nNo, no. Because the people that are using it are our hours are eight to five. Basically, Melinda just fell out of her chair. She's like I'm here past five, but it's usually eight to five though we need support because it's not like the field that's going to be using it at five a M in the morning or if it is, we would just push it to the next day if something was wrong. So.\nJOE\n31:36 \nYeah. And again, if you need catastrophic help, we're here for you.\nBRETT\n31:39 \nYeah, I'm not concerned with that. I am concerned with the next point. I thought that was a really good point that I'm not sure if there's any apparent, according to him, there's no language in there that if by chance something was down on your guy's side for an extenuating amount of time because there's nothing that allows us to recoup some of those costs while you guys are down.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Brett said the team uses training and quizzes monthly.

{"prompt":"JOE\n32:04 \nI might refer to you on that one.\nDRUE\n32:07 \nWell, you scroll down a little bit. Is this the, this 13?\nJOE\n32:12 \nThis one, right?\nBRETT\n32:13 \nHere. Yeah, 13.\nDRUE\n32:20 \nAlso have…\nBRETT\n32:23 \nHave you, do you, have you, has this ever happened before? Is a good place for me to start?\nJOE\n32:31 \nNot that I know of Drew. You correct me if I'm wrong there. I highly doubt it though.\nAbout Docebo\nDRUE\n32:36 \nWe haven't had any of our companies come on board for North America or Canada that have had any type of financial comp claims, right? So, let me look at the verbiage here.\nJOE\n32:54 \nThe note I put to myself had to do with like a three year versus one year, but again, it gets back to that point of price. It puts us at.\nPricing\nBRETT\n33:03 \nNow, he's talking about if there's no… if there's no service to table for a few months, but, you know, but we're paid X amount of dollars for the year. Like what does that look like for us? Like we can't be on the hook for an extra three months that we were not able to use the system is what I think he's worried about.\nPricing ends\nJOE\n33:26 \nYeah, I would say it wouldn't happen obviously first and foremost, but at the same time I read through this. I'm kinda curious. I don't know the legal aspect of that, to be honest.\nDRUE\n33:43 \nYeah, I can't speak to this one. I've actually, we've never even really had push back on this one specifically.\nAbout Docebo\nDRUE\n33:51 \nThis would be something that we could clarify with our legal team just because if there was any type of financial compensation that would go through them and our account management team directly so we can dig deeper into this one on financial compensation. I just can't imagine ever that our system would not be usable for three months let alone ever like even an hour.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJOE\n34:20 \nMore than an hour. Yeah, yeah.\nDRUE\n34:24 \nWe can look into this one for you. I can just tell you confidently that this would never happen but.\nJOE\n34:32 \nI think our client base would not allow that to happen is probably the best way to put that… but I marked it as a go back for us to try to get some more info for you.\nPricing\nJOE\n34:49 \nLet me see here Professional service fee table.\nJOE\n34:57 \nPayment terms. The note I wrote here was net 30 is what we had for the proposal and that includes the Professional services that was set as net 30 as well. Is that kind of what you're asking or am I misunderstanding that?\nPricing ends\nBRETT\n35:22 \nThink the way he wrote it, excuse is that seems pretty cheesy to me. I gave you exactly what he said because I didn't wanna, I didn't want to delete something.\nJOE\n35:34 \nI…\nBRETT\n35:35 \nJust, I'm not that guy. So I think what he's saying is if we were gonna cancel the contract, I guess it's only up to your guys sole discretion. And that says in section three point six. And I mean, there were only, the only reason that we would want to cancel the contract is if something was bad on your side and like we were not getting the time frame or was not usable. I think that's where he's coming into of like, hey, it can't just be up to them if the service is so bad or we're not able to utilize the service for what it's meant to be.\nOnboarding\nBRETT\n36:13 \nWe should be able to, we should have some in kind of out to counsel and it shouldn't be just up to you guys to decide, yes, we're gonna let you have the contract or not let you out of the contract. Gotcha. If there was extenuating circumstances not just because my, gosh, we're not making enough money this year or something like that. Not that at all, but he, I know when he was talking or he talked to the CEO, he's like you just wanna make sure that it's not working on their end and you can prove that the service level is not meeting our expectation, then we should be able to get out of the contract, you know, paid up to whatever, and then maybe a 30 day or 60 day notice or what have you, but not for the entire contract. So.\nJOE\n36:55 \nGotcha. So this is much deeper than I thought it was. Drew. I'm pretty sure that we don't have any kind of, you know, out on the contract when it comes to just service level. So let me know what your take is on that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Brett asked what would happen if their customers weren’t able to use the system for a few months but they still paid for the full year services.  END"}
{"prompt":"DRUE\n37:10 \nSo there's no no outs on the contract based on just kind of what we've talked to up into this point.\nPricing\nDRUE\n37:19 \nAnd based on what you've mentioned about your cio, it might make more sense just to do a one year versus multi year just because that way you do have, you know, an out at the end of each year versus three years.\nJOE\n37:38 \nIt would just be… the challenge for you.\nDRUE\n37:42 \nYeah, you would just have, you would pay a little bit of a premium for a one year, but it's a little bit. I guess from you guys is perspective less risk.\nJOE\n37:58 \nYeah, maybe it's helpful. Brett and I'm happy to do this as well is actually provide you a one year proposal just so you have it in hand. If you want to compare them. It's really easy for me to whip up. And again, it just shows you that I looked it up. I think it said 30 percent discount overall. So it's a good way to look at it side by side.\nBRETT\n38:20 \nReally good way to look at it and prove a point to a financially conscious organization. So please send that over.\nJOE\n38:28 \nI'll do that as a follow up as well.\nJOE\n38:34 \nAnd then let's make sure to go through these. What are we on here?\nBRETT\n38:39 \nSix number 15.\nJOE\n38:41 \n15, thank you.\nJOE\n38:47 \nThis is expense for us traveling to you guys. We're not gonna need that, that's if we're doing in person set up in any way Shape or form or in person training, which some people purchase into like Professional training, but we're not going that route is what I would say.\nPricing ends\nJOE\n39:05 \nSo it's just on the contract if we send somebody your way, essentially which we wouldn't be doing… and correct me if I'm wrong on that Drew.\nDRUE\n39:17 \nCorrect. Okay.\nJOE\n39:18 \nMaking sure… let's see that we're on sixteenth three point nine. I am not familiar with this Drew, but the actual lockdown of admins to be able to purchase items within the system is what this is about. I'm not familiar with this to.\nBRETT\n39:43 \nAnd Joe, I'm not sure of items that can be purchased. I don't think we covered that in the demo at all. I'm not sure what there is like what kind of add on? Is that when, I mean when you're logged into the platform or are there like being in the app store, you can purchase a couple of other things here and there, or?\nPayment Gateway\nJOE\n40:01 \nNot really. It's more like in go ahead Drew.\nDRUE\n40:05 \nOnly see this in franchise groups where each different franchise has a different owner and they say, you know what I wanna add on dos content authoring tool and I'm just gonna click and add it on and then it's going to get billed somewhere else like from a different cost code, billing code. So I can't imagine that you guys would ever have this instance, but we protect the business by not allowing any separate kind of entity. Just add it to the cart, whatever else they wanted to add into your contract.\nJOE\n40:47 \nThat answers that, right? That was a little better than I could word it through. So I appreciate that.\nPricing\nJOE\n40:58 \nThen looking at number 17 here, it's the same as 300 being the minimum. So there are no downgrade options anyway, yep.\nJOE\n41:13 \nNext one.\nBRETT\n41:18 \nThis one did catch me. I think I highlighted on my phone too, the, because we're locked in for those three. If we were gonna do the three years, and then in here, I did to say, and maybe we're just not reading the contract correctly, but it was like an Automatic 10 percent price increase. What, so give me the legal of that. What is that about?\nDRUE\n41:42 \nSo at the end of your contract term?\nBRETT\n41:46 \nContract, right? At the end of that one, if that's what we're okay?\nDRUE\n41:49 \nWhichever contract term you decide upon.\nDRUE\n41:58 \nThat could be up to a 10 percent increase in the cost of Docebo at that time, three years from now. So you would not have any type of increase during your contract term. But when you're up for renewal, that price could be up to 10 percent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Pricing discussed regarding one-time contract versus multi-year, with a focus on one-year renewal.\n• Brett asked about the potential 10% increase in cost for renewal of Docebo. END"}
{"prompt":"BRETT\n42:17 \nOkay. And same thing would go if we had the one year, then at the end of one year, it's a lot more than the three year price right now. And then I'd have to tell them and actually they could charge us an extra 10 percent once we've got this up and rolling because one year we're going to barely get off the ground. So I'm on our side, I guess if you wanna say as far as the three year contract goes, because within one year, we're not going to have anything really done yet or we won't have any amazing results anyway, so.\nDRUE\n42:46 \nPercent is pretty standard. I know you mentioned looking at separate HRIS systems too, right? Like a lot of HRIS systems do 20 percent adp does like 25 percent uplift or something crazy. So 10 percent is pretty standard. And of course, it's better to do a longer contract. But if you wanna do one year, then we can always do that.\nBRETT\n43:09 \nOkay.\nJOE\n43:13 \nThe next one is gonna.\nSmall Talk\nBRETT\n43:17 \nHe's really locked in on that. He just does not. I don't know. I don't know it's funny because it's not like he got back to me and John didn't get back to me and say, I've only heard horrible things about the table. And like, you know what I mean?\nSmall Talk ends\nBRETT\n43:31 \nOr like you guys have been down forever. I think he's just so cautious with it stuff. So yep makes sense. We don't have to cover that because I totally understand.\nJOE\n43:40 \nAt the same time, I mean, again, that same argument a one year versus three potentially if you want to take that route as well and just show them that kind of risk.\nBRETT\n43:48 \nRight here.\nJOE\n43:49 \nSo, next one's here a small thing but not that this contract is not assignable. So this is like a signing. It should Gothic change hands or something like that is essentially what this is that… you.\nBRETT\n44:08 \nI was just gonna say that would make sense to me that it wouldn't be transferable over to whoever the new owners are yep of the company.\nAbout Docebo\nBRETT\n44:16 \nAnd given where family own private business, I mean, it could be sold, it doesn't look like it'll be sold in the next 10 years at all. But if it did, what a waste of money.\nJOE\n44:26 \nThere's three points here. These last three points Drew you and I on our internal notes just put red lines for legal that all three of these would need to go to legal for changing in any way she perform.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJOE\n44:39 \nBut at the same time, Drue, I don't know if we want to speak on these just to, before we kind of go that route. I know that with the logo usage that's a pretty easy one that we can usually just strike out and correct me if I'm wrong on.\nDRUE\n44:52 \nSo, the first one, typically, when if a company were let's say Gothic, you guys were to sell Gothic, typically, our account management team would work with whoever purchased you guys on continuing that contract at that same rate and going through that process with you. It's not all that common necessarily. But if it does happen, we just typically try to renew with the new purchaser, okay? And then what was the one after that? We wanted to talk through and set.\nJOE\n45:33 \nWaves the right a jury or spining arbitration.\nDRUE\n45:40 \nYeah.\nJOE\n45:41 \nFamiliar with that.\nDRUE\n45:42 \nReally speak to this one. I just know that legal that's one of those as they don't redline that one. Okay? I know that directly they just won't remove that, gotcha.\nJOE\n45:57 \nAnd then the logo usage was the last one which I don't…\nDRUE\n46:00 \nYou should, absolutely, we can take that out that's optional for you guys. If you want us to use your logo, we'd love to do that. If not, we can strike that.\nBRETT\n46:11 \nYeah. We definitely, we definitely wouldn't want to give you just the rights to do that without, you know, I have, it would have to be written consent from the guy that's in the next door to me. So.\nJOE\n46:23 \nSo, maybe that I'm putting that as a go back for us through that, I can have our legal strength.\nDRUE\n46:30 \nTo move the logo usage if at any time like we wanted to add it in later, right? Like let's say you guys have really strong usage and you're doing some really cool stuff in your system and we wanna work with you guys on a case study, then we can negotiate it at that time. Yeah. But logo usage, let's just knock that one.\nJOE\n46:50 \nNo. Okay. That should be easy to do.\nBRETT\n46:55 \nI'm not sure what we need the jury for in this case anyways, because I know that we have the exact same thing in our employee handbook, like we're going to go to arbitration before jury any day, and it's usually beneficial to both parties, but I understand that where you guys are coming from that. So you don't have to worry about that… cool.\nWrap-Up\nJOE\n47:19 \nThat's all of them. Well, do you wanna go back through anything? Any questions we didn't answer?\nBRETT\n47:28 \nI don't have any unanswered questions.\nDRUE\n47:32 \nI would say for you guys take away would be, you know, of course, as you go through these with your cio, I think you seem pretty confident enough to kinda speak to what we talked about today, which is great.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Brett and Drue discussed the terms of a one-year contract and how the price will differ from a three year contract.\n• They discussed 10% being a standard uplift percentage.\n END"}

I'm Jenae, I live in Omaha. I lead our employee experience team. And in the absence of not having someone who's doing L and D as a full time position, my big take is that the heart of employee experience is learning and development. I paired that with connection that's truly, I believe what makes people stay at companies which is the heart of engagement. And so, for me learning and development, if I could double down on something that we're working on the next in the next year, like this would be it. And I think we can utilize your system from an onboarding perspective that would help us scale in a big way as well. I'd like to pair this with a… you know, with a mentor ship program. And so, I think that there's a lot of different areas here. So really excited to get a demo of the product. I'll have Charles on Lauren, explain what they currently do at the company. How I see them working with this is through the lines of employee experience and helping with setting this up, tying it to a mentorship program, tying it to our ergs and development within our E RG organizations. And for right now those are the big ones more to come.\nJEREMIAH\n3:56 \nThat's awesome. No, I love that. And I think we'll share as we continue conversation, we'll share kind of what we have learned so far as well so that we can fill in any gaps but specifically understand like what your specific needs are, what your measurements of success want to be, so that we can understand we really are the perfect fit if everything's great. And it seems like our conversations were siloed in the beginning. So I'm glad we have a larger team here. And lowest, I saw this you stuck in as well. Lowest is our solutions consultant and have her give her a little bit more time to introduce herself. But Charles and Lauren, if you can go ahead and give us a little bit more insight into what your specific needs are and goals out of this will be great.\nLAUREN\n4:35 \nYeah, definitely. I'm currently the employee experience program coordinator. So definitely just working side by side with Jane and Charles and really digging deeper into making the employee experience at SmartRecruiters the best that it can be. I kinda have experience I would say with like the learning and development and career pathing because I first started in sales and definitely and kinda just more reached out to Jenae about going towards the HR and employee experience. So I think definitely utilizing a tool for like career pathing and having that available to our employees is definitely something that we're looking forward to and just to keep growing our employees because if I can do it and I reached out myself like just imagine if we had a tool to do that, I definitely think it could help grow the company and bring out the best experiencing people say I'm excited.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae leads the Employee Experience Team.\n• Lauren is currently the Employee Experience Program Coordinator.\n• They are excited about utilizing a tool for Career Pathing which could help grow the company and bring out the best in employees.

So not a super long period of time, but I have been in learning and development for probably more than 15 years now. So lots of experience in this space, and it's really great to be talking to you.\nJEREMIAH\n6:41 \nAwesome. And I'll wrap up to I'm Jeremiah, I'm the account executive here. So really just a transparent person in here to make sure that you thoroughly evaluate that we are not wasting our time. That I'm safeguarding my time, lowes is time and that we really just dive into what is really going to make a difference in the organization too.\nOnboarding\nJEREMIAH\n6:57 \nSo we're definitely looking for a partnership as we continue the conversation. So as we dive into a demo today, we don't want this to be a presentation. We want it to be really, you know, a conversation around how we can help you use cases, maybe some specific things that we didn't catch with our initial conversations. But if it's okay with everybody, I'm gonna quickly share my screen and just kinda touch base on what we initially talked about and then ask a quick question to share gaps. I swear I've done this before. It's been a couple of weeks. Okay, perfect. Lordy. All right. So what I ultimately wanted to get out of this is that that's our initial conversations demonstrations.\nOnboarding ends\nJEREMIAH\n7:39 \nWe learned that there wasn't a centralized land system or function today. Training is kind of housed all over that. We do have a global organization. We may only be focusing on specific locations today. I'm not sure if that is, you know, a change if we're going global or not. But just knowing that you have a lot of resources and a lot of technology that you're leveraging in order to, you know, track, deliver and train all of your organization. So some of the desires that you wanted to focus on were some of the things that you've really reiterated today, right? Creating the learning culture for employees, making sure that it's really easy to use, that it is plug and play friendly with the environment. And then it can handle some of those core competencies and tracking and be part of those programs and mentor ships that you've mentioned. So integrations are going to play a big part making sure that we can take the administrative burden off of your shoulders.\nIntegrations\nJEREMIAH\n8:26 \nWe also talked about creating content and pulling content off the shelf. So as we demo today, we'll be able to show some of that. It is of interest. Some of the things that we talked about having is that I've been with a little over three years, but we've seen the table come from just kind of an LMS to now a one stop shop, right?\nIntegrations ends\nJEREMIAH\n8:45 \nSo wherever you go with your learning strategy, wherever it kinda grows or evolves, too. We have, whether it's within our system or within our suite of products. A. Way to engage and adopt in any of those struggles. So I is getting a little bit wordy. But the thought was to tie everything into one system so that you not only can deliver training but you can adapt and have collaboration whether it's with managers, whether it's with the… administrators or leaders in your organization that are creating content, working together to deliver content, or if it is just within a need to have more interaction within a system.\nLayout & Content\nJEREMIAH\n9:20 \nSo driving that engagement. But is there anything we're missing here that you'd like to add before we actually dive in and take a look from a learner perspective, what it might look and feel like?\nLayout & Content ends\nJENAE\n9:31 \nI think probably that a couple of things I'd like to highlight which may get answered. So, so just be like awesome.\nLAUREN\n9:38 \nWell, that later is.\nJENAE\n9:40 \nCurious around language functionality. And I believe when we first had a quote on this, it was for a segment of the organization and I would like to expand that to find out what the quote is for the whole organization.\nPricing\nJENAE\n9:52 \nI'm thinking 450 seats instead of, I think the first one was 300. I'm so curious as to how that would change things moving forward.\nJEREMIAH\n10:01 \nPerfect. And we'll talk about our active user model. It's very interesting. So an active user is not only somebody that logs in but they have to interact with content.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n10:10 \nSo they have to click on a course. They have to take a live video. So if you have people that aren't going to be in there every single month and we can, you know, maybe tailor that and save and not necessarily have to grow as quickly as we think. But we'll definitely look at all options.\nLayout & Content\nLOIS\n10:23 \nI…\nJENAE\n10:23 \nLove you for that. I think maybe that's something that was not, may have been lost in translation as to how that works. So we can discuss later.\nJEREMIAH\n10:31 \nCool. Cool. Awesome. With that being said, then I'm gonna stop sharing my screen and lows. I'm on a, I extended our platform, I know that you have been in there as well, but I thought this is that if we jump in from a learner perspective and take a look at what it might look like because we have people that are coming in from onboarding.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Charles is transitioning from Remote Operations Manager to Employee Experience.\n• They mentioned there is no centralized system for training and a learning culture needs to be fostered.\n• Integrations, layout & content, and pricing will be discussed in order to create an easy-to-use plug & play environment with tracking capabilities, content creation tools, and collaboration functions. \n END"}
{"prompt":"JEREMIAH\n10:46 \nWe have people that have been there. They have tenure. They may not want the same experience. So I'll let you take over. And then of course, if you don't want to drive, please do hop in, let us know.\nLOIS\n10:57 \nYes, please, if there's any questions at any point along the way, just let me know and hopefully I did unmute myself. Perfect. So if you can see my screen there, just give me a thumbs up there. Perfect. Excellent. I'm logging in with the user name and password and that branding is all customizable for you. But we also do support single sign on as well. So if you wanted people pass directly into doable from other systems, we can accommodate that.\nLayout & Content\nLOIS\n11:26 \nSo it's been a while since I've talked to you guys and I was actually kinda surprised at the way we set this up. So it's been a while for sure that we haven't been in this site but I'm coming right in and I'm landing on a page for a learner, but, you know, if I was an onboarding, I could come in just pop in on an orientation page here.\nLayout & Content ends\nLOIS\n11:53 \nI could just be very simple. Have folks directed to move everything from that not yet started column over to that completed column. The page that I land on is determined by my user profile. And so any of those additional fields that you apply to the user even down to like where I'm located can determine which page I land on as a user as I'm coming into the platform.\nLayout & Content\nLOIS\n12:22 \nSo the reason I learn landed on the learn page instead of the orientation page is because Ashley the user I've logged in as her Audience is beyond onboarding and she is a learner now and she's just landing on that homepage. But again, everything's widget based customizable. Really, it's what you want it to be in terms of the experience. So any questions so far on pages or anything you've seen so far? Is it?\nCertifications\nJENAE\n12:51 \nManual process of moving things from not yet started in progress? Or as you're going through, it will auto move things to the different stages.\nLOIS\n12:58 \nYeah, it auto moves. So as I go in, if I click on this, it should move me now that I've been in here although this is an ILT so it may or may not if I hit view the recording, I'm not sure how long it'll take me to update this. But as I come in, I complete content and then I go back, it should automatically there. Thank heavens. It did. It just moved it right over here to the in progress. So I haven't completed it yet. But I have started. So it's moved me over. I don't have to do anything as a user and we will move.\nLearning Plans\nJENAE\n13:33 \nI'm sure we'll get into this in the actual sessions of how we track if people are actually completing it versus like skipping through it et cetera. From this page, is there customization of like I'm envisioning our remote onboarding process as two tracks? One is a required track and then one is elective. So think like college, you have your core curriculum and your electives. Is there a way that we can say which of these are required versus not required?\nLOIS\n14:03 \nYou can, you can absolutely set up what we call equivalency. So if it's this course or this course, they can be equivalent to one another and the others marked complete as soon as I finish the one. So that's an option in terms of doing that you can assign things to people. So all of this is required content for Ashley in terms of our onboarding. But if I go back to that learner homepage, what you'll see are some catalogs here. So I've got online courses. I've got management development. These are all open and I can come in here and say, maybe I wanna do the management essentials course and just click in and enroll myself in that course. So it can be completely open. Is in I'm going to let them go to a catalog and select a course or it can be I'm assigning all of the electives.\nLearning Plans ends\nLOIS\n14:56 \nAnd as soon as they finish this one, this other one, they don't have to take. They're both marked complete. So there's a couple of different ways you can do that. You can also add text wherever you needed to if I wanted to maybe on the learner homepage, put a banner across the top using each CML in the widget to say in the catalogs below, select two courses from this catalog, three courses from that catalog and make it, you know, up to them and not do the equivalency so that they can have the option to do those other courses, lots of different ways you could accomplish that for sure.\nJENAE\n15:33 \nYeah. Okay. Cool.\nJEREMIAH\n15:36 \nAlso tie into that, you know, depending on who the learner is, I think we're going to pull, you know, if we're doing internal employees from your HR system. So if it's high Bob today or it's going to be day for tomorrow, whatever the HR system is, we'll be pulling that in depending on which role they are.\nBranches & Groups\nJEREMIAH\n15:50 \nThey may have all the mandatory training that's assigned to them right there smack data center. But right below that you may have if you want to call it like collective or additional content or maybe content that's relevant to their role or to their, my gosh their location, you name, it can also set that up on their landing page, so it could be different and unique based on who they are, where they are and how you want that information to be pulled.\nBranches & Groups ends\nJENAE\n16:13 \nWe're walking into this pretty, I've had a little bit of knowledge second hand as to some of the features and functionality Charles and Lauren do not. And so by the way folks, if you have questions like toss them out because if you have them, I probably have them to is… I was told we can do like, there's a whole list of courses you'll have.\nCourse Enrollment\nJENAE\n16:40 \nAnd then there's also the option for us to upload our own. And it can still be in a similar format of this where it's… like, yeah, Instructor led things E learning et cetera. Would love to hear more about that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeremiah and Lois discussed the layout and content of a platform, which is widget-based and customizable.\n• Jenae asked if there was customization for required versus elective courses, to which Lois replied that equivalency can be set up so that certain courses are automatically marked complete when others are finished.\n• Jenae inquired about ways to upload their own courses in a similar format as Instructor Led Training (ILT) and E-Learning. END"}
{"prompt":"LOIS\n22:16 \nAbsolutely. I thought I just touch on the central repository first since we mentioned it. It's just a way of pulling that content in. And as Jeremiah said, you can organize that in folders. You can look for a particular type of content. If you were interested in just seeing which videos are in the system, it's telling you which courses they're being used in. So that video happens to be used in three different courses to. So as you were talking about doing a custom intro and outro, you might have different versions of that for different Audience members or different job roles. You could have the same video playing in three different courses, but a different intro and euro for each specific role. So you can get that granular if you want to. And then in terms of things changing over time, if you wanted to see whether you have a different version, if I could actually type here, I can see here because this little icons dark end that I have a two different versions that were used. Version one is no longer being used in the system. The version two is being used in those two courses. So it's giving a bit of an audit trail as well as things change over time. And then when we get into the course itself, what we can do is we can pull that material in. So I'm gonna pull up this starting with the basics course rather than create a new course. This happens to be an E learning course with a lot of different content in it. So we have everything in here from video to powerpoint, etcetera. And really if I wanted to add more training material, I can pull it in directly from the central repository or I can actually just start to pull a file in. I can create that test if I want to. And under evaluations here where I have that sign on submission. I also have a test here as well. So if I wanted to go in and take a look at that, I think I can edit it here. I can't remember how.\nCourse Enrollment\nLOIS\n24:13 \nSo I'm just gonna go in and create a new one when you start to talk about having that be self marking, what I can do is I can start to add that. I don't know what I clicked on there. Something wrong? I think because your faces are in the way and I'm gonna be able to pull in whatever question type I want if I want it self marking.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nLOIS\n24:34 \nI would stay away from that text entry like Jeremiah mentioned. But here, I can manage how long I have the different options for the test, et cetera. Any feedback I wanna give them. If I wanted to set feedback to come back depending on what score they achieved. In the task that's all set up right within the course itself?\nCoach & Share\nJENAE\n24:56 \nTheir call to actions, that can happen after people submit their stuff, like if it's like, I would like to chat with someone from the employee experience team around this, like my I'm envisioning, we start doing more coaching around some of these topics that are going to be coming up for folks. Are there certain things that we can do for call to actions or text fields where we can tell people where to reach out to?\nLOIS\n25:21 \nYeah, go ahead Jeremiah.\nJEREMIAH\n25:22 \nSorry. Yeah. So we talked about engaging with our, we have something called discover coach and share within our platform and it's more on the learner side that we probably can show that. But it is a way that we can guide them to contribute to specific channels or groups, whether that's reaching out to have a discussion with somebody, whether that is adding a document, maybe a knowledge resource or something to a specific channel. But it allows you to set specific cohorts up with the ability to communicate, collaborate or engage in like sharing files, documents in different things.\nCoach & Share ends\nJEREMIAH\n25:55 \nAnd I think the goal of this is that anything you put into the LMS, it's going to be index transcribed and cataloged. So if I go to that very top search bar and I am just in the flow of work and I hit a key term, it's gonna pull up not only any of those mandatory courses you've made me take as a learner, but anything that I've also enrolled myself into or if I have access to that specific asset, you've uploaded into the channel, any question or answer that's been asked around that. So if I have visibility into it and it happened within the platform, then I can search it.\nCoach & Share\nJENAE\n26:27 \nCool. Okay. Cool. I think there's a, I think probably Wade had chatted with you about one of the things that we're rolling out as leadership commitments across the organization, and we'll be creating some custom content around that, and I anticipate that there could be a lot of things where people would want to provide feedback links to other resources, etcetera, that would be valuable to the community. Cool.\nJEREMIAH\n26:55 \nAnd I like the way you're wording that too because not everybody needs to have feedback permission, right? So maybe for certain people have access and at the top, right? If you actually can click on that little hat to ask a question or even, yeah, I, we can basically allow them to have different channels, right? So maybe a question goes to mandatory training, maybe it goes to industry specific, and these are just things that we've created, right? So I want you to use your imagination on what those channels might look like for your team, but those would be on the back end, a subject matter expert or manager and admin is going to be receiving these questions and having the ability to answer them.\nCoach & Share ends\nJEREMIAH\n27:30 \nAnd on their landing page, they would then have task widgets that say, hey, you have a new question in this answer? Maybe we'd even email you and nudge you on your platform to make sure that you know, things are happening, but definitely big onto the collaboration association. And I think that gotcha. Given the amount of time to, I'd love to even show our internal one so that you see it kind of like even as a salesperson, I have access to like all of our sales collateral, all of our major documents, but I can't see anything that lowes has access to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae asked about call-to-actions, where learners can reach out to receive coaching or additional resources. END"}
{"prompt":"JEREMIAH\n27:57 \nShe has access to all of our like technical data, API integration, like the smart stuff like that's way over my head but I don't have access to it because it's not a need for me specifically, I can still integrate to ask questions to the channels that I have access to and it makes it a lot easier in the flow of work because Slack is your only other pit of information and I can find something from six years ago as easily as I can find something from last week.\nUser Permission\nJENAE\n28:21 \nTotally… cool. Question on accesses as well. Is there a way for individual managers to be able to find resources and make that required? Like tell me about user Permissions. Can individual people give access to their teams for stuff? Or does that go through specific admins that would be on our team handling that?\nLOIS\n28:48 \nSo that depends on you. So we have a level of access called a Power user which you would probably have for most managers. And what you do there is you can provide a profile to that person where they have beyond basic user level, but not as much Power as a full admin. And so you decide whether you have one profile or you have several different profiles with different types of access. So that user could have access, you know, to reporting and their users, or they might have access to reporting users and content. So it really depends on you and how you want to set that up. But yes, you can absolutely give additional access to certain users in the system so that they can perform additional functionality. And I think it's a great way to leverage the expertise out in the organization. You don't want it always to have to come back to you. If you have instructors that are going out and helping to train these folks, you may want to give them a certain level of Power user access, so that they can be helping, you know, mark those assignments, submissions, or reviewing some of those checklists coming in. So it really is very flexible in terms of having a different levels of access to the platform.\nJENAE\n30:06 \nOkay.\nJEREMIAH\n30:07 \nBe helpful to see what a manager might look like or might look at when they log into a platform. And so I thought that might be helpful too. I believe we have a Power user created here that has some employees underneath them so that if they have, you know, a team of users going through, they're able to see exactly what's happening when it's happening and report on them as well.\nLOIS\n30:27 \nYeah. So this particular Power user, they have access to courses as well as their users and some reporting. So Alex is the Power user and I always call her. She, it never occurred to me that Alex is gender non specific and it could be he as well. But her folks here have some expired certifications here.\nCustom Reports\nLOIS\n30:50 \nOne overdue course as well. And if Alex wants to get in touch with Ashley, she can send her an email. She can enroll her in courses. She can go and look at her user summary report which is kind of a level of reporting at the individual level that's all available to the Power user here.\nCustom Reports ends\nLOIS\n31:09 \nThere's some skills overview. We'll look at skills in a minute over on the learner side of things. We didn't touch on that yet, but suffice to say we have an aggregated level for the whole team. So if Alex wants to get a view of all of the skills that her team is working on as a group, she can get a view to that as well particularly as you're looking for someone to do maybe a stretch assignment, what skills do I have out on the team where I can choose someone to take this on those behavior checklists as well? I can come in, have a coaching conversation with someone. If we have either had them observe themselves or have observed them, had an Instructor observe them and send that in. So some great functionality there as well. And then when we talked about those assignments submissions, I can come in here as a Power user, find the assignment and it's kept right here within the course itself. This is the assignment that's been submitted. So Jason sent this video in. I can come in view, it, give him some feedback. If I need to. I can mark them as failed and allow them to re upload if I want them to redo that or mark them as passed as well.\nCoach & Share\nLOIS\n32:23 \nSo lots of functionality as well. And those questions that are coming in my expert tasks. I have a page to come here, take a look at what's been submitted by the community, review it and approve it. If it's suitable to go out to the organization. Any of the questions that have come in, I don't have any open questions right now, but this is the page that Power user would review those on and provide that feedback back.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae asked about user permissions.  END"}
{"prompt":"JENAE\n32:53 \nOut. Awesome. And that's cool that we can review and approve assets before they're available to everyone. Because that was a question I didn't think to ask but it's very helpful to know.\nLOIS\n33:03 \nYeah, yeah. Absolutely. So that's kind of it from a Power user perspective. Would you like me to hop back over to the learner profile and kinda look at, you know, maybe what a learning path looks like or the content that's managed from the learner side of things or is it more useful to head over to admin and kind of dive into some things?\nUser Permission ends\nJENAE\n33:27 \nWhere are skills located? I would really like that.\nLOIS\n33:31 \nSkills absolutely. So that's on the learner side of things. Obviously, there is admin as well, but we'll look at it from the learner perspective first. So we're back as Ashley our learner and she has a skills dashboard. So this is kind of self directed or you can ask the manager to direct the user in terms of the skills, but it's more, I would say qualitative than quantitative. At the moment. A lot of energy is going into developing at our skills capabilities as well. But Ashley has chosen certain skills to work on including time management, public speaking, et cetera. She thinks she's a beginner in terms of her public speaking ability, but maybe she's completed some courses and she feels now like she's more at an intermediate level. So this web is gonna tell her where she started with the skills she's working on and it's gonna give her a view in terms of how those skills have grown over time. Sorry, were you gonna say that? Yeah?\nJEREMIAH\n34:37 \nA lot about this is that organizations now are choosing to do some type of test as like people are coming on board to figure out kind of where you are specific level, whether they've created it or if they've got it from like an industry lead or creative type of space. But they're trying to figure out kind of where you are whether it's me saying, you know, I'm a beginner intermediate. This is how I fill is the skill. And then we have a manager go in and say, okay, this, you know, I've seen XY and Z and I think they're at this level. So you have two different inputs, the imprints from me, the inputs from the manager. And the goal is to say, hey, today, I've started at this area. So that diagram at the very top is giving me kind of a general area of where I'm starting today. And then six months down the road, you're gonna see based on the courses that I'm taking, the tests that I've done and completed, and everything that I've associated within the platform is now going to start to change. And it can show me not only through the lessons that I've taken, the hours that I've spent in the platform, but I can actually show me via a graph that I'm making change towards that. And positive change has been reflected in studied to produce more engagement and produce a better, you know, enhancement within the platform. And it will show you kind of where people are wanting to spend time so that, you know, hey, I'm, getting this calling to focus on these more skills or I'm getting this feedback. But again, this is a little bit newer for our platform too as well. So as we develop our skills, you'll get more Notifications and pieces. But I'm curious where you want skills to go because I think competencies and certain things for like your leadership space, the mentorship program, those are all gonna play kind of a role in this in a way. So I'm curious how you want that to work?\nJENAE\n36:11 \nTwo things. Number one, I think the leadership… competencies that we are creating will be something that we would like to be tracking over time. But number two, maybe even a bigger thing for me is that if we can start to match, so like these are very clear career pathing opportunities that we can create for folks. If we can start to map what current roles are in our organization, the skill sets that are needed for that, for those roles which we're currently doing on the recruiting side. And as we can start to match those with these skills that would be listed in here, we can start to tell people here are the specific areas where you can start to increase in here is clear courses that we can help provide you along that path… which for me would be a huge win. So my question is number one, does that make sense? Number two? Where does this list of skills come from? Do people type it in or is there like a master skills list? Because honestly, we're at the very beginning stages of this. So if I could take this skills list and we start matching that from our side of stuff on the other side, amazing.\nLOIS\n37:22 \nYeah. The list is in there and there are hundreds of them. So you can map your courses to the skills that you want to take them with. When we set up a course, it actually will ask you kind of on the main page, what skills you want to associate with that course. You do have the ability now and I gotta check this, but I think in the last few months they've released the ability for you to actually add skills that we don't have in our list Germany's nodding. So I think that's validation, right?\nJEREMIAH\n37:56 \nEarly December we got the full go ahead on that. But yeah, I mean the thought is that we have a lot of organizations and a lot of customers that will be kind of a Guinea pigs with us and make sure that they do the trials and errors. And for some of the skills, it took a little bit longer than expected. And the reason being is that when we leverage a ton of skills, we can't necessarily filter some of the good ones and bad ones. And you would be surprised at the words that you just don't think of that are actually like they're not relevant and they're kind of bad.\nJENAE\n38:25 \nTheir own, yeah, I.\nLAUREN\n38:26 \nUnderstand.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae is interested in mapping organizational roles with existing skill sets and creating clear career pathing opportunities. \n• Jenae asked where the list of skills comes from.

{"prompt":"JEREMIAH\n38:28 \nJust completely off the wall, you let you know. I never would have thought about that, but now that it's there, I don't want my learners to ever see that. So a lot of finding and things that just the, you know, engineering teams just don't realize and we don't realize. So, yes, we have released that and then adding your own has been like the latest thing. But skills is like one of the biggest things on our radar as far as the road map goes. And I'm excited our road map will be released like mid January or February or something. So I can get a copy out to you all as that happens too because it's I mean, it's huge.\nJENAE\n38:56 \nYeah. We would also be interested in being testers as we move forward with this by the way. Like whatever beta programs you have, we would be interested in that. It's funny. You say that because Charles just this last week, like we made a list of like interests and one of them was domestic violence and I'm like, well, for the record, we're not interested in domestic in.\nJEREMIAH\n39:14 \nLike…\nLOIS\n39:15 \nPreventing and like awareness around, yeah, like.\nJEREMIAH\n39:18 \nA…\nJENAE\n39:19 \nPrime example. So when it comes to custom skills and tell me if there is a different area that we would do instead of under the skills area, but I think it could work here too. We're also starting wanting to tie court some courses back to our values. So, you know, it make like one of our values is CEO. Well, that's technically not a skill per SE, but we could list it as value slash CEO if no one else is seeing that. Like can it be custom just to our organization?\nJEREMIAH\n39:50 \nSo, we have things called tags?\nJENAE\n39:52 \nOkay, perfect. That'll do.\nJEREMIAH\n39:53 \nI really like what if I'm just gonna throw the, what if out there, we have a localization tool. Maybe you change tags to values like the name tags to values and people search values instead of searching tags, but I don't know if that captures it envisioning 100 percent.\nLearning Plans\nJEREMIAH\n40:09 \nWe could categorize it in a couple of ways. When we talk about creating courses as well. We can categorize the course and give them the course codes.\nJENAE\n40:21 \nLike a learning path based on values too or like I'm just wondering you could.\nJEREMIAH\n40:27 \nChannel based on values like you have on this value, all the courses related to that value or that channel?\nLearning Plans ends\nJENAE\n40:36 \nYeah, a similar thing with each of our leadership drivers as well.\nJEREMIAH\n40:41 \nSo, here's the, what I love and hate about Docebo. There are a lot and I don't know which one's the perfect one for you. But I can say here's door number one, two and three and do either any of these doors fit with the way that you're looking to design it and deploy it? So I would be curious as to like what that vision looks like? A lot of this is like, hey, give me the world and let me see if we can build it for you in a lot of times we really can.\nJENAE\n41:07 \nOkay.\nJEREMIAH\n41:08 \nHere's…\nJENAE\n41:09 \nAnother question I have for you. I love this I'm nurting out. So I used to work at LinkedIn. So I have like a lot of background of learning stuff on the back end and also like matching skills with the profiles and doing some cool things like in the community with like building real time curriculum with organizations to get jobs for people.\nOnboarding\nJENAE\n41:28 \nLike so I could nerd out on this all day long. I know that when we start it's going to be overwhelming. Tell me about what the onboarding process is like and how we would walkthrough deciding some of this stuff to take our first steps.\nJEREMIAH\n41:44 \nSuch a good question… onboarding for us is a big collaboration event. So I'm creating in on the back end what's called like a foundation and we call it like the name or it's like a quit. But essentially what you're looking to accomplish, how you're going to measure that success and ultimately like where shortcomings could happen from there, we figure out who on your team is going to have some responsibility in the LMS. And then we go ahead and we map out our project plan for you typically about eight to 16 weeks. And I believe that we chose the 16 week plan. We have two different plans. We have an eight week plan and a 16 week plan. There really isn't much difference other than just being able hold your hand a lot longer. The integrations are all very easy for your team to set up. But when it comes to discussing best practices, talking about launching different use cases within the same platform in different pieces, like the more time you have, the better we can guarantee a successful launch quicker, you know, advances.\nOnboarding ends\nJEREMIAH\n42:50 \nAnd then we're also here with you meeting with you every quarter once you launch. So by means having that partnership, is that we're not gonna let you fail. We're gonna talk about any shortcomings that are happening, talk about things that you love that you hate. We're always going to be continually working together so that at the end of our renewal period, we have that 91 percent retention rate that we have sorry, 91 percent retention rate so that we can continue to Talent that because it's huge for us but no learning is big time, right?\nCourse Enrollment\nJEREMIAH\n43:18 \nSo we're gonna, and we're going to enroll everyone into the university that's our online learning pathway. And there's probably around 12 to 15 hours of actual learning that you'll do online. We'll couple that with Instructor led meetings that can be once a week. It could be twice a week based on your availability and how quick you're wanting to get up and running.\nOnboarding\nJEREMIAH\n43:36 \nBut our goal is to define exactly what we're going to work on each week. We're going to give you the materials that you need to understand what to do. And then we actually do require you to go in and configure the platform. So, yes, we're here to, you know, hold your hand, make sure that it works and configures, right? We are going to also make sure that you are 100 percent stable and that you're not gonna how to pick up the phone to call us to make a change to support you of course, if you have like troubles, you'll have an account manager, you'll have a solutions deployment manager. If there are technical requirements that go above and beyond which I don't know if there's anything that we've talked about so far that would go above and beyond. But we have a technical account manager that we can also put into the account. And then you'll have a customer success manager.\nOnboarding ends\nJEREMIAH\n44:18 \nSo, lots of people that you'll continually be reaching out to for whether it's support answering questions or us reaching out to you so that we can communicate and collaborate on what's happening, how's the success going? Where's Growth heading? What do we need to think about as far as like grow growing, adding new locations, you name it?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae shared her background on learning platforms from previous work experience at LinkedIn.\n• Janae asked about the onboarding process & taking first steps.

{"prompt":"LOIS\n50:22 \nSo clearly, I've missed something here, but it's going to allow you to send that out based on who needs to receive it, whether it's all admins, all Power users, certain users, and you get to customize that based on what you need the notification to say.\nJENAE\n50:39 \nOkay. Any. Sorry. Go ahead.\nCertifications\nJEREMIAH\n50:44 \nWe also have a training and recertification app which allows us to track any of those mandatory courses or like what I'm trying to get like security fire extinguisher, like all those random things. You have to take the ability for us to track that and make sure that we can email or send Notifications to let you know, hey this is coming up on renewal. And I know that Lewis is already here. So you have the actual name of the course, the description of the course and the expiration, maybe it's expiring every one year, every three years, every six months. And then what we'll do is we'll start notifying. And I don't know if we've mentioned this at all, but everything we're talking about is also available on your mobile phone.\nMobile App\nJEREMIAH\n51:23 \nSo if they've logged into the mobile device, they also get Notifications on the mobile phone. So if you haven't got pinged enough, it will come there too as well guide us on if there's anything that we didn't answer from that initial question.\nJENAE\n51:36 \nIs there a way to ping someone's manager, if they haven't like in how users are set up?\nUser Permission\nJENAE\n51:43 \nCan they be mapped to a person? And so that way, like a manager could be pinged if people are outside of a window?\nLOIS\n51:49 \nYes, absolutely. So when we set up the users profile, and if we just go back and look at Ashley here, she has a profile. And within her profile, if I look at this, it's going to capture all of the information about her including any additional fields, her job role, where she is, et cetera. And if she has a direct manager, she can be mapped there. So Alex is Ashley's direct manager. If she had folks reporting to her, you could say, yes, she is a manager. This user manages a team and who are those team members? So that mapping can go in both directions. And that manager does have insight in terms of who is coming up for renewals on certifications or is overdue on courses. So it's gonna show both on their Power, user dashboards there as well as you can have a notification setup that's gonna ping them email as well. If that's happening?\nUser Permission ends\nJENAE\n52:54 \nPerfect. We, will that be like, can that be auto sync to high Bob, for example? So in their line of who they report to changes, it would auto change in the system.\nLOIS\n53:09 \nYeah, absolutely. So we can do that by APIs. If you wanted to set it up to be completely automated. We also have an Automation app that's gonna allow you to either export a CSV file from hi Bob and then have doc pick it up. So in that case, if I have just a new rule here, whoops cannot be blank. I always miss things when I do this. So I'm gonna schedule something, it's gonna happen dearly at one a. M. And the condition under which it's going to happen is a new file in an FTP folder. So hi Bob is gonna export the data in a CSV folder, put it up to your FTP site. And when we see it there, we're gonna pull it in and that's gonna update everything. If I have a new manager, it's gonna update that field on my profile.\nJENAE\n54:03 \nOkay. And so we could have it. So it syncs regularly to those fields and hi up like the manager one, I feel like we would want pretty real time. But for example, if we do, I'm trying to think ask people to enroll or re enroll as here's a good example like a lead of a employee resource group that is probably going to only change, hopefully not more than once a year. But like it could be, this seems like it would be perfect for like a spot in time if you want things to be from that point.\nLOIS\n54:35 \nYeah, absolutely.\nJEREMIAH\n54:36 \nLike hourly. It doesn't have to be just like daily. It could be like six, it could happen six times daily if you wanted to, just depending on how many changes or how rapidly changes happen. But I really like about this as well as it's bidirectional. So if you do have certain things you're tracking in hi, Bob, we can also push like completion data and certain things back if it's necessary to.\nJENAE\n54:56 \nOkay, cool.\nJENAE\n55:01 \nAwesome. What else do you got?\nJEREMIAH\n55:08 \nWell, I guess we looked at courses specifically\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae inquired about whether it was possible to ping someone's manager when they have not completed something after a certain time period, which Lois affirmed is possible by mapping them in the user profile and configuring automated notifications.  END"}
{"prompt":"JEREMIAH\n55:11 \nWe haven't looked at any reporting or tracking any analytics through any side. And I'm not sure if that would be, you know, important to us. We are like a full learning repository or RS or anything that happens when the LMS is tracked and reportable. So it can happen within the system and it can also be downloadable.\nLayout & Content\nJEREMIAH\n55:27 \nSo how you wanna see it's really up to you. We have a couple of course dashboards that we can show you as far as like giving you a highlight from the organization or showing you as tailoring it if you wanted to look at it for maybe a specific location.\nCertifications\nJEREMIAH\n55:39 \nInstead, you can see exactly how many people are enrolled, what the health of the courses are, and maybe a percentage of like when people are taking a course, if they're taking courses in November and they're completing it. But December, nothing's happening. We know probably should something new in December, taking words right out of lowes mouth there, if that's a lot.\nCoach & Share\nJEREMIAH\n55:59 \nBut again, at the top, you see the PDF option if you wanted to, you know, PDF and roll into a meeting and say, hey, this is what's happening in the organization today or if you just wanted to really scroll into a specific location or department and say, hey, this place is, you know, this team is struggling, what can we do to drive more engagement in this specific piece?\nCustom Reports\nJEREMIAH\n56:16 \nBut this would just be kind of like a ready report. Where the fun happens is if we go to a custom report builder and we actually start slicing and dicing the data the way that you wanted to. So we can pull reports in a lot of different ways, whether it's on courses, whether it's on user or specific sessions. But in order to give you just a general idea, we'll go in and just create kind of like a blank tester and show you all the different fields and columns that you can pull from. So the whole point of this is just to do it once, right? Go in, create what you're looking for and then have this scheduled to where it sends to you on a daily weekly, monthly cadence. But you are driving the data that you want. You're getting the fields all right. And then you're saying that you want it to show up in your Inbox at a specific time and this will save you from having it show up and then having to re, slice and dice it. Or… there you can sort all the fields right within this or preview it before you save it.\nJENAE\n57:10 \nCool.\nJEREMIAH\n57:11 \nAnd as we talk about Permissions, you can give certain users Permissions to the report, you pull, you can give them access to pull the reports. You could limit them and not let them see reports. It's completely up to you.\nJENAE\n57:22 \nOkay.\nCHARLES\n57:23 \nAnd then within the reporting feature, we could like also see like our top learners and like could we pull that report and, you know, entice more people… to do learning?\nCustom Reports ends\nJEREMIAH\n57:34 \nYeah, Lewis, can we show the dashboard there? I think if we hit the admin cog, will it's like that very first one top left?\nLOIS\n57:42 \nThis one here?\nJEREMIAH\n57:43 \nSo I love this. We've actually set something up to entice people like that. So we'd have it on the top. We have it based on activities.\nCoach & Share\nJEREMIAH\n57:50 \nSo we wanted to kinda drive like, hey, how many people have posted? How many people have asked a question or, you know, did something there? So we have that at the top, we could also move this and restructure it. But as we scroll down, you'll see top contributors, top three, most watched courses are assets, most popular, least completed, you know, like the negative side effects to it as well so that you can track that and figure out why.\nCoach & Share ends\nJEREMIAH\n58:12 \nBut this is just kind of a teaser to show that you definitely can have all those different types of reports and dashboards so that you can tell a little bit of a story as to what's happening and where you should spend time.\nJENAE\n58:21 \nAnd I think a second question building off of this is absolutely the next direction I wanted to go was into gamification. So actually promotion and enticing people to come back to the like to be using it regularly. I would love to dive into that.\nLOIS\n58:40 \nSo gamification is part of the basic platform. So it's not an extra. You can turn it on if you want to or just leave it off while you're coming up with your strategy around it. But we do have badging and leader boards. So our learner Ashley here, she's at the top of the leader board and she can compete against either the entire organization or just her immediate team. It's completely up to you how you set up those leader boards. A, and when we go into the gamification app and look at badging, Ashley has the option to share her badges out to LinkedIn or Facebook if she wants to. So you're getting some of that social aspect of earning points when, or badges when you're completing those courses. And then the other piece to this is our reward shop. So if you want to enable the ability for people to use their points or coins that they've earned towards rewards, you can set that up. And again, the reward set can be targeted to everybody the same, or it could be targeted by job role. If you wanted to buy location. It's whatever makes sense to you. And typically, the best way to engage folks is to have meaningful rewards for them to. So I often tell the story that I worked for a company. Prior to Docebo. They had a fairly robust rewards program running with a gamified element and they gave away once a month, you could bid on a parking spot at the door. And we were a company that was very small, probably about 100 people. You'd probably walk further to get it into a building at them all than you would at this office.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae expressed interest in gamification.\n END"}
{"prompt":"LOIS\n1:00:16 \nBut people loved it. They bid on that every single month somebody on that designated parking spot and it was a huge engagement factor for them. They just really knew that these folks loved parking right beside the door they wanted to go. And so I never understood. I'm like I need the walk I'm gonna park back here.\nSmall Talk ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:00:41 \nWe have a use case, come out. Sorry. A case study come out here shortly as to the difference in adding the rewards program because it is a little bit of an admin work on your side to think about like we have coins, people redeeming something is going to be a cost to the organization.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n1:00:54 \nBut I mean, even if it's like an additional paid time off, maybe there's not, there are rewards that don't cost additional like revenue in order to set up, but they talk about just the change in attitude and engagement within the platform and kind of the difference in the engagement from like month one to month two.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:01:11 \nAnd then when the rewards were added from two to three and just the, you know, it's not gonna fit everybody. We don't all have that native, I guess competition drive but it's just trying to figure out that you have one platform that needs to fit every single person. And there's not one magic wand. So there's so many pieces that have to work together and come together. The more different avenues that we can offer and help seem to… seem to be working, but.\nJENAE\n1:01:39 \nThis link out to something else. So, for example, if we have a swag store that's hosted on Shopify, could we link to that?\nLOIS\n1:01:48 \nI think you can with using APIs, I'll get more information for you about that, but I know we do… I have heard of others not integrating but using APIs to pass like the number of coins they've earned across to another kind of rewards management system. But let me ask the specific question around Shopify and a swag shop because I haven't heard it phrased exactly that way before.\nPayment Gateway\nJENAE\n1:02:18 \nProbably a workaround is they can redeem a 75 dollar coupon code that's for them or something like that. So they do that from there, and then they would still go to the Shopify store, but I would, a direct link would be awesome. I have some really big ideas for stuff like this but it'll be a multiple stage approach, but I think there's some cool stuff we could do here. Who was just speaking?\nPayment Gateway ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:02:44 \nIt was actually me, sorry, with our internal platform, we actually can redeem swag as well. And it just looks like a box like we're looking here. So I'm curious as the back end how we have that integrated to?\nJENAE\n1:02:54 \nYeah.\nJEREMIAH\n1:02:54 \nWhere that would come from because I know that we don't do that off hand. Our office managers are not boxing up swag as we purchase, so.\nJENAE\n1:03:02 \nYou laugh, but we were doing that six months ago, so.\nLAUREN\n1:03:06 \nBetter stuff.\nJEREMIAH\n1:03:07 \nYeah, you're not wrong. I got to start somewhere.\nJENAE\n1:03:10 \nSpeaking to the…\nLOIS\n1:03:11 \nQuir here.\nJENAE\n1:03:14 \nWow. Okay.\nJENAE\n1:03:20 \nWhen it comes to building custom content, wait had told me something about and I'm really gonna Butcher this. So help me translate. What this actually means is like we could take prerecorded content or slide decks that we had have been using previously and like it can help kind of turn it into something a little bit more. Can you explain that process?\nJEREMIAH\n1:03:46 \nDefinitely. And I am locked out of it lows. I don't know if you have access to Shape. I'm not sure if we are going through. I'm sure you don't know what Salesforce is, but we are doing major changes to our Salesforce and it's gonna be down all this week, which is like hour for me, right? Because I have to do Salesforce updates is like the biggest blessing in my life. But now that being said, I can't go in and actually refresh my password ended at the end of December, I change it. So it's just like come on.\nJENAE\n1:04:13 \nYou know, it's fine.\nJEREMIAH\n1:04:14 \nYeah, this journey for me has been great. But Ricky mistake having said that what it is called the Shape. So we are a suite of products. We have about six different products in our Docebo suite and one of them is going to be on the content creation side, but it's not like your typical content creation. It's you've probably heard of like Articulate or Captivate story line that spits out this very fancy scorm package. What this does is it's like the MIddleware between you making a PDF or just recording a video and it actually producing something that's like micro learning ready to go and fancy enough to like just Captivate the Audience. So, yeah. So our goal is.\nLOIS\n1:04:57 \nOops, I think we lost Jeremiah. I'm not sure why, yes. So I can pick up there. It does allow you to pull in either a document like a PDF, a powerpoint deck. You can even point to a link on the web and it will take the key points from that and create a small video with caption. A, it will add imagery or small video clips behind and it will get you about 80 percent of the way. As a former instructional designer. I really like the product because it doesn't have the kind of scale curve that like a scorm development tool like Articulate or Captivate would have it's really simple to use and you can go in and you can edit those captions, you can swap out the image if you didn't really like it. So you have full kind of editorial control on what you publish out at the end. And it is super simple to use. It takes about 10 minutes once you pop that link or the PDF in for it to do its work and use a I to pull in those key learning points. And then at the end you edit it, I tried to pull it up. It says I'm out of Shape and my trial has ended. So unfortunately, I can't pull it up either, but yeah, it does a lot of the work for you. It's a nice product.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jenae asked about building custom content with help from Docebo's suite of products; Lois then explained how the product works, what it can do, and how simple it is to use.

That's what I have for questions off of the top of my head.\nNext Steps\nJENAE\n1:11:20 \nI wanna be one of my things for this New Year's being really respectful of time. So we are over already. How are we? As far as a stop? Are there additional things you would like to show us? Or should we schedule another time to come back? What should be our next step?\nJEREMIAH\n1:11:39 \nThat's what I'm supposed to say to you believe it or not, how much more do you need to see? Because I mean we can been a lot of time and this is this our first time really talking? We're covering a lot. I can only probably remember like 60 percent of what anyway says and then I rely on the recording for the rest of it. So like, I definitely, I mean take a ton of notes from our call… as far as time goes, I don't have another call until 445. So I'm happy to stay on answer questions is completely different story. I don't know what her schedule is like.\nLOIS\n1:12:13 \nI'm good. So this is my last call today, but I will mention Jan, I mentioned she is interested in Shape and I thought we had a video we could send over and then maybe schedule something to look at the product when we can both get into it again.\nJEREMIAH\n1:12:27 \nAt that point, yeah, I mean as early as Monday of next week, we'll have everything in sync away and ready.\nNext Steps ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:12:32 \nThe goal of our Salesforce launch is that we can do all of our own quoting and tools instead of worrying about leveraging someone within our deal desk or internal team. So it's just, it's really just streamlining it for everybody. But unfortunately, it has to be down and our lowest, our slowest time is this week, so.\nLAUREN\n1:12:50 \nThat, that's fair. That's…\nJEREMIAH\n1:12:51 \nFair. I.\nJENAE\n1:12:54 \nSo, does that mean right now you don't have access to see like what we currently have been quoted or any of that yet?\nJEREMIAH\n1:13:00 \nSo I can share that with you. I do.\nJENAE\n1:13:03 \nI have access to it. I wouldn't mind running through it with you though. And if, I guess, I'm gonna ask maybe a dumb question, but if there's anything that I don't know that I should be knowing. I'm a big fan of this, I would really, I would like to talk a little bit about the number of users and how that piece works. I would like to really get moving on this on our side as soon as possible. So that's where I'm at.\nJEREMIAH\n1:13:32 \nThat makes sense. For sure. Let me share my screen really quick. And this is the last quote that I sent out. So aside from like dates and names that will be the main change as far as discounts on pricing right now, it is all the same.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n1:13:47 \nI have heard that we're going to do a pricing change. I don't know when it's gonna happen. I am praying that it just doesn't happen. But as far as like where organizations are headed, something's gonna happen eventually. It's not gonna affect us either way. But what we had was you'll see kind of the list price that we have, the discount percentage that we applied and what that total was. And I'll give you the full total here in just a moment, but let's talk about kind of what we quoted. The main LMS is the learning platform and we quoted 300 active users. So this means that you are expecting anywhere from one to 300 unique individuals to not only log in but click into a course and take training or attend an Instructor led sessions. So you're grabbing the attendance, you know, that they've been there. If they just log in and they poke around or they click on a course and they don't actually start to learning anything. They just look at it. They don't enroll into it. They're still not active. Okay. A lot of people registered logging in but not active, which is a good sign.\nCoach & Share\nJEREMIAH\n1:14:49 \nOkay. Within the platform we discussed discover coach and share briefly. This is a separate line item. This is that collaboration, the ability to ask questions and answers, to tie subject matter experts to channels and to allow anyone to like upload assets to a channel. So really just kind of like the interaction and collaboration piece.\nIntegrations\nJENAE\n1:15:13 \nCool. I like that. I think that's a big piece for us from an experience perspective.\nJEREMIAH\n1:15:20 \nAbsolutely. When you mentioned like the mentorship side of things and just doing a lot of the leadership in the Q and a site is going to be huge. Yeah, it's definitely great. Another line item here that we had was going to be the content off the shelf. So we have three options that we can sell content. We have a 50 bundle, a 150 bundle and then access to the whole catalog, access it different for everybody. This can mean access for just the admins, you could literally give access to all of your employees. They can search any content they want and learn anything. So it's really just in case whatever you wanted it to be whichever option you choose, it comes with the content curation specialist. So it's like your own library and to source content pathways and take some of that burden off your shoulders too.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed further steps needed to move forward with their project, including sending a video related to Shape and a plan for when they can look at the product again.

{"prompt":"JENAE\n1:16:06 \nWould our content curation specialist be someone who can help us then with like skills in which skills would be attached to stuff or is that kind of auto there?\nJEREMIAH\n1:16:16 \nAbsolutely. You can actually search and filter by skill within the platform. But that curation specialist is really there to say, hey, this is like all the courses that you have available. Now. Let's go through all these to match that way you're not just like doing all of the work. They'll pull all the relevant pieces and just make sure that you pick the one that fits your Audience the best.\nLOIS\n1:16:37 \nAnd I just thought of what I was gonna mention about languages. You mentioned the content marketplace would mainly be in English, there is there are other languages available through the content marketplace?\nPricing\nJENAE\n1:16:48 \nOkay. So this one here, is this the full library is?\nJEREMIAH\n1:16:55 \nThat would be everything.\nJENAE\n1:16:57 \nAnd you said the other options were 50?\nJEREMIAH\n1:16:59 \n50 courses or 150 courses.\nJENAE\n1:17:03 \nAnd remind me premium is 900 and growing or something?\nJEREMIAH\n1:17:07 \nPremiums, 90,000?\nJENAE\n1:17:09 \n90,000 and growing.\nJEREMIAH\n1:17:11 \nBut then again, I mean, if you wanna know how to become a Baker, like there's stuff like that in there as well.\nIntegrations\nJEREMIAH\n1:17:15 \nSo it's not always going to be relevant to you. But out of 90,000 courses, you might have 10 on the same topic. But one is gonna be visual. The next is going to be reading. One is going to be interactive. One is going to be mobile friendly. So there's just tons of different options to make sure that there's really hitting or addressing your Audience.\nJENAE\n1:17:33 \nOkay. And why is this one discounted 20 percent instead of 40?\nJEREMIAH\n1:17:38 \nBecause we leverage a partner and we leverage partners in order to have the latest and greatest content, we do not create content ourselves. That would be a lot of work to do. So we actually our providers go one. So go with the number one dot com is our provider. So you actually see your content curation specialist with a go one email address. But yeah, I mean the pricing for this is incredibly good in comparison to what you might see in other places too.\nJENAE\n1:18:12 \nGreat. Had shank you?\nIntegrations ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:18:14 \nNo worries. No worries. We had the sandbox and sandbox is not typically something that we provide. It's just like an ask. And so we included this at the same 40 percent that we did with the rest as well. But this would just be to give you access to anything that we do as far as like my gosh why can I not? I guess releases changes, updates. You have multiple weeks ahead of time to test those out.\nPayment Gateway\nJENAE\n1:18:43 \nLike early like beta access or? Okay. So it's not necessarily a separate testing environment or is…\nJEREMIAH\n1:18:52 \nIt is, it is a completely separate URL. So that way you can have come, you know, test environments and then you actually can choose when you want those test environments to flood into your main installation.\nPayment Gateway ends\nJENAE\n1:19:03 \nSo this allows us to test like for example, the brand new onboarding flow with fake onboarding people first to make sure all of the things work before we would release it to actual people.\nJEREMIAH\n1:19:15 \nThat actually gives me some common sense as to why you might need this way. Did not give me any insight into why he might need to use a sandbox, but the way that you just described that would make perfect sense and as to why you would want a test example, especially if you're launching a new use case. Maybe you don't want to interrupt the current use cases that are going on or maybe like stop yourself from making a mistake, hang around in the system definitely.\nPricing\nJENAE\n1:19:40 \nI'm also from the point of I'm going to go in with a higher price point. And then if I have to negotiate down fine, but I'm gonna get what I'm gonna ask for what I want.\nJEREMIAH\n1:19:49 \nAs you should definitely 100 percent, there are two other lines we'll talk about the Professional services is onboarding. So this was a 16 week training, the trainer approach. So it includes the online training, the over the phone in person training, as well as the monthly and quarterly meetings once you go live. And then the only the product that we had was to say both Shape. So this is the content offering tool and this gives you access to all 300 users actually have access to Shape.\nCoach & Share\nJEREMIAH\n1:20:22 \nIt does not have to be this way. It could be just administrators that can create shapes. But if you did want to have maybe a subject matter expert or a manager have access to getting something out to maybe like a sales team or a customer service team as to how to handle an objection super fast, then you can also do that too.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n1:20:39 \nOkay. And then all of that total, I believe that we did a 24 month term to keep the discount percentages. I believe that we've mentioned that one year term was desired. We don't discount one year term. So it's a drastically higher price to do just the one year. So the two year, the 40 percent. So it was 58 640 reoccurring yearly with just a one time 98 10 for the onboarding and Professional purposes.\nJENAE\n1:21:06 \nOkay. All right. Tell me about active users. And if we were going to increase that to 450… I love the only thing is if we start to use this and we make this required training, then for sure, we're going like if, you know, like if all of our required trainings are necessary, like the, what am I thinking of? It's? A C word that's HR compliance training stuff happens through here then they will automatically be considered active users, right?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Pricing includes Full Library (90,000+ courses), 50 courses or 150 courses, and Premium (90,000+ courses). \n• Payment Gateway included 40% discount for a 24 month term with 58,640 recurring yearly and one-time 9810 for onboarding and Professional purposes. \n• 450 active users would be considered. END"}
{"prompt":"JEREMIAH\n1:21:40 \nJust for the 30 days that they're taking that training, right? So maybe that you stagger different locations, maybe certain compliance for different departments happens in different months. There are a lot of ways that we can tailor that to make sure that you actually can stay on a lower tier instead of having the upper tiers. We're all about taking money though. Like, so don't feel bad. No, I mean the thought really is to get in at the lowest point possible so that you don't feel like one, you're overpaying and that Growth. But I mean, obviously, there's two, it's a double edge. So we don't want to put you in the 300 and then immediately say like you got to jump to 450 or 500. So I would say that you would know better than me if you think that you would have more than 300 people and let's say by 50 to 100. If you think you have more than 400 people in the platform every month taking some type of training, then pricing you out of the 500. It's the way to go. We would want to go ahead and look at the differences. But if you really think that it would be just a little bit before you're having over 300 between all locations doing some type of training in the platform, then our thought of grow, you know, start small and then grow crawl before you walk before you run.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:22:48 \nWe love that. We love to grow later on. It's just an addendum to our contract. You're not going to renew because you have to grow.\nJENAE\n1:23:01 \nI'm just gonna have to think through that. Thank you for your honesty and that is really helpful.\nJEREMIAH\n1:23:07 \nYeah. And on Monday, I'll write a quote.\nPricing\nJEREMIAH\n1:23:09 \nSo let's say everything stays as is you'll have a copy of a 300 and a copy of a 500. So, you know, exactly what your differences are. The percentages discounts will all say the same. But that way you at least have an idea and you can budget effectively if it doesn't make sense to do it today, then it would, you know, a couple of months later on down the road or, you know, whatever your schedule might look like.\nJENAE\n1:23:30 \nHave 300 and we… know that we're going to do a one time training and people have 30 days to do it. So they, some people would be in and out of the system. Is there, like do we get dinged for each person above at like a certain amount or?\nJEREMIAH\n1:23:47 \nYeah. Yeah. So I mean, like we do statistics like on a monthly basis. So like an organization that has 300 employees, statistically, we can prove that 30 to 40 percent will be active on a monthly basis, higher than that. We're saying that you are super exactly. So it's really tough, right? The one off trainings again, like based on how you deliver it, how you communicate it, maybe you have one or two months where you go over to 300 monthly active users. We have an overage fee. So it's like per user, if you go over 300, then it's I think it's like five dollars and 90 cents per user that you go over. That would be the only thing it's like a one time Bill. So like if you went over by 10 people would be five dollars and 90 cents times 10.\nJENAE\n1:24:39 \nYeah… which, yeah, I mean depending on what the price is for the total, if we know we're going to do that once a year, we may go that route and just take the Ding for the overage fee for that and stay. But I'll just need to have a little bit more conversation around that. I also think that there's some other things we could do where all of people managers do their training the first month. And then it's rolled out to me is 50 percent of our organization namer is the, you know, other 50 percent. So I think we could probably split it up a bit.\nPricing ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:25:13 \nAnd gosh, if only you had a system where we could read some of this data, you know, I'm joking. But yeah, I mean, a lot of it is trying to learn what's gonna be the best mark. I mean, so the first year really is like the best year for everybody, right? It's like it's the chaos. We're trying to get it all set up and figured out, did we do a good job? Let's get people in there? And then we start to be able to tell a little bit of story from some of the reporting and some of the, you know, engagement that we're seeing.\nOnboarding\nJEREMIAH\n1:25:39 \nAnd then if you open it up to, you know, whether it's surveys providing some type of feedback is gonna be huge. So that way, you know, like, hey, which courses are hitting the mark, which courses do we need to actually focus on? And we'll again like the best practices and knowledge sharing, we'll talk about all that throughout the implementation and onboarding process.\nOnboarding ends\nJEREMIAH\n1:25:57 \nSo, you know, what to look out for. You have a small and robust team. So it makes it even easier. It's actually harder the bigger teams because there's so much that everyone wants to do. It just makes it tough. So with a team, the side, I mean it really would make it very streamlined for us to talk about kind of what you want to accomplish, how to get there.\nWrap-Up\nJEREMIAH\n1:26:15 \nAnd then really it's just kind of gosh what's the best term for it? Trial and error until you figure out like the best thing for each department?\nJENAE\n1:26:24 \nAbsolutely perfect. Lauren Charles, any questions that are top of mind for you? Otherwise we can totally sync off this as well.\nCHARLES\n1:26:35 \nYeah, I think we can take our questions offline. You thought of questions that I didn't I couldn't even think of. So thank you.\nJEREMIAH\n1:26:45 \nPerfect. It's been a pleasure and thank you all for the additional time as well. I'm glad that linked up this way, my thoughts after this call is that once a recording is uploaded, I'll send this out to you.\nOnboarding\nJEREMIAH\n1:26:55 \nSo you have access to it all up with a couple additional resources, brochure for content, just some technical pieces, everything that I can think of, I guess as far as just the first step in. But honestly, I mean we've we had a lot of conversations and for this just to be our first one and let's just hit the ground running, it's probably not gonna happen.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeremiah discussed pricing options, suggesting to start in the lowest tier and grow gradually. \n• The onboarding process was discussed, including suggested best practices to maximize individual performance.

I want to do this for a while.\nSCOTT\n0:55 \nYeah, test, tell me about it. So, you don't know how frustrating it is when you do all of this work and I am on a very literal and I guess you can say, yeah, I came out of the military and I shouldn't be this way, but I am… common sense type aspect because everything in the military is not common sense, but like hardly anything is right?\nAbout Docebo\nSCOTT\n1:24 \nBut in doing so… I'm very, you know, go go go, you know, here's, a problem. I wanna fix it and this is how we fix it. This makes sense. We get, you know, there's an ROI that's an achievable goal from the company's perspective, blah, blah, blah, and they're like, yeah, yeah, we're gonna just do this.\nSmall Talk\nSCOTT\n1:45 \nLike, so when I got on a call with the CEO and the words stupid came out of my mouth, that was probably not the best thing in the world to say to a CEO. But I mean, I'm not the political person.\nTIM\n1:57 \nRight. I love it.\nSCOTT\n2:02 \nBut it was, we just had a call yesterday.\nSmall Talk ends\nSCOTT\n2:09 \nSo, I was in the office, we had a call yesterday and… interesting information came out of this. So the LMS that, so you remember, Casey, Ricky?\nRICKY\n2:22 \nYep.\nSCOTT\n2:22 \nOkay. So, Casey is the admin for the net exam on the Skyhigh security side for the tax owns one side, Skyhigh Security owns the other, but they kinda share the same instance, well, that one might be coming up for renewal and telex might be kicking them off of their LMS and forcing them to purchase a new LMS and so they have kinda like this hidden purse or should I say some hidden funds that nobody knew about.\nAbout Docebo\nSCOTT\n2:56 \nAnd on top of all that, there's a huge ever like revenue recognition aspect that's been going on. We have a large amount of business that we've been utilizing on the pro serve side because we deliver courses.\nRICKY\n3:12 \nYeah.\nSCOTT\n3:12 \nWe're talking months they've been going through is like we should get this much money, go figure out how we get it.\nAbout Docebo ends\nSCOTT\n3:22 \nWhat? So we have to go dig through the tree. And so the T is silence supposed to be the relic but no, it's…\nRICKY\n3:29 \nWe…\nSCOTT\n3:30 \nWe, we love our counterpart company but no… so in doing all of this, we've been, you know, when they said, hey, this is what net exam gave as a quote when Casey was going through and he's like this is what, you know, the quote would be for us to stand up net exam. I'm like… okay… let me take that and let's run to cable for the entire company, for the entire company. He's like, I like that idea. But the leadership on that side for pro serve doesn't so when we got onto with the CFO and we were chatting, he's like, yeah, this is great. Let's can this for now? And that was at the end of last year, even though we had the great deal, we had everything that was set in stone that we could just jump on it, but we didn't have funds.\nRICKY\n4:27 \nYeah.\nSCOTT\n4:28 \nNow, this magical number came up… that we know what they quoted now.\nPayment Gateway\nSCOTT\n4:35 \nIf they wanted to keep their business course, they're gonna play the number game, right? What they wanna always do. I know it because we all buy use cars, we all buy new cars and we never pay sticker price that's just the way it is. It's come on just the way we work. So going through all of this.\nPayment Gateway ends\nSCOTT\n4:59 \nI guess you can say I spun words in such a way that, so Eric sun tag just like the word Sunday in German. So Eric son tag will be the one that he is our he's leading it.

I'm like, no, we don't we need to talk to Docebo and he's like, well, we need, I'm like, no, I've already done the three and a half four months of work of doing demos in see what's all the he's like, did you?\nSmall Talk\nSCOTT\n5:39 \nSo I sent them the document, he's like… okay, now we also have another individual called Nick Lebron. I mean, make sure I'm saying his last name, right? I always messed up his last name. So run Lebron. Yeah. So Nick is, I guess you could say the admin side for one of the admins. So… come on, why doesn't my stupid teams open up there? It is… Lebron. Yeah, Lebron. So Nick is going to be joining the call. So you'll have Dave, you'll have case you'll have myself. And then Eric, son tag is kinda like the lead that's going. He's the political adviser will say, right? He still puts me on the tip of the spear to beat up everything and fight, but he's the political person. I don't play politics, nice like that. I just get the work done.

{"prompt":"SCOTT\n6:49 \nNick is kind of like, you know, in, for making sure that we get the gist of what we need for internal. I know that the one year the two year, the three, all this stuff is gonna come up. So I just want to be, you know, fore, warning you. So just I'm trying to set the road to where it needs to go. And I told him I said I'll have a call with Ricky and I will see what I can bring up. And then once we find out because on Monday… sorry… yeah, Tuesday, a lot of stuff's going down on Monday. Eric is having a chat with like he had a chat yesterday with the CEO and the CFO and they're both like nodding like we need to do this. He's having a chat on Monday with… the cto which is under the basically controls the funds will say for the PS, but we're trying to make sure that we have the people from PS, we don't want them in, you know, stabbing us in the back later on. So on Tuesday that's when all of this is gonna go crazy. Tuesday morning, we have a call with PS and Nick and Eric. So we're going to chat and try to Cohort them into moving towards getting off of net exam for the better good of the organization instead of themselves and then move to Docebo which… Nick. So Nick will run and across both say that they would rather have Docebo than any other LMS. So we're all in your favor. It's just how we have to push this now. Eric is kinda like he's out there. So he's not your champion and he's not the one that says yes or no. That would be our C level executives, but they will never get on a call. They're just fighting for us. So if you wanna say champion, yeah, that would be me. I only have, I… beat it until I get what I need to move forward. The biggest thing is about ROI and the way that I told them and I was talking to him yesterday, we're able to show an ROI within about three to five months.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n9:12 \nThe quick turnaround depending on a couple of things at the end of last year. You shared a quote that said, yeah, it's a three year deal. It's 80,000 dollars for the first year. No overages, blah blah blah, you know, all the things that you were gonna give us.\nPricing ends\nRICKY\n9:26 \nYeah, I.\nSCOTT\n9:26 \nCan't say no to that, but of course, they, you know, leadership it… we have possibly the ability to grab a hold of the funds from the pro search side. Remember that little change person that kinda like came UN hidden because their renewal if they have to go net exam is at K. So I'm like… let's move it, let's you know. But then of course, we have to get the, I wanna say it's a cio because we have to use the, it on the Trello side because we don't have our own, it, we share the, but they don't like I don't call it sharing. If they don't give us any time… it's not… so we have to work with the tree it to make sure that we can implement this. That's why I was really a stickler on. And I apologize what her name was because we had your pro serve individual was talking about typically looking for how many hours do I need? Our it?\nRICKY\n10:41 \nYeah.\nSCOTT\n10:42 \nSo I can fit this in. So… with all these moving parts and it's like a big game of chess that I'm playing right here in my head. I would assume by Tuesday, as long as I have numbers basically from Docebo saying, this is what we can do.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n11:03 \nNow. The one thing that Eric is going to be a stickler on and so is Nick, hey, they're going to be, you know, kind of like playing that standish off kind of aspect because the first numbers that I gave you is like we have 115,000 partners globally. I know all the numbers I shouldn't but I do that's what Eric can should know. I know that we have, you know, millions of customers all over the globe. I also know that we have about a 1,000 employees collectively. It's about 900 employees, but it's actually about a 1,000. We keep growing, right? Yeah, we just had a lay off kind of thing, but, you know, so we're in that flux. We always do the layoffs every year. That's what all companies do. It's just part of the big games. So we're still sitting around 900 to a 1,000 employees. And I'd rather make sure that as we grow, we can still not be overcharged. You know, like not have any overages now with 115,000 partners. My assumption was, I believe the first numbers I gave you, Ricky were three?\nRICKY\n12:08 \nOr 5,000. So we went up to 10,000. Yeah. I believe you gave me in that, yeah, you gave me 1,000 internal, 200, this was to get it started. So this was the initial numbers. So you said a 1,000 partners to started off, which I imagine we'll probably change for this.\nSCOTT\n12:28 \nIt, it will, I'm assuming that and that's the biggest thing.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n12:32 \nSo I spoke with… the admin, I guess that runs all the reports on the tree side. They do the Saba and we share, you love this one, we share the same partners. So because we were mcafee altogether and then split. So we have fire eye and make that came together.\nIntegrations\nSCOTT\n12:55 \nAnd then we split out and we made tree high security. That's basically how we came together and split apart. So as we still have and share the same SFDC on the back end side. So that's going to be a problem with the LMS, but we have to be able to tie into the SFDC to be able to pull it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nick and Eric are working to get the organization off of NetExam and on to Docebo for a better solution. \n• Scott is a champion for this change, pushing to see ROI within three to five months. \n• A three year deal with Docebo has been quoted at $80,000 for the first year with no overages. \n• They need to be able to tie into SFDC.

{"prompt":"SCOTT\n13:16 \nYeah, share it over to there. But just, you know, so I know that they have 115,000 partners because cause we have 115,000 out of those they've been running and they've already redone their whole Saba garbage LMS that they play with. And in the past before, so it was the last six months, the last two quarters, they had basically 3,000 partners that took like was it 3,000 or a 1,000? I can't remember. I apologize. I'm trying to remember the numbers. It was either a 1,000 or 3,000, but I know that it was like 20 something 1,000 courses that were taken between those one or one, two or 3,000 partners. That was, it was like… but okay, was it the same one? And they said, yeah, it's always the same people. So I was thinking in the very beginning that we have about 10,000 partners, I'm thinking.\nRICKY\n14:19 \nYeah, that was, I have the original numbers, 10,000 partners, 1,000 employees and a 1,000 customers.\nSCOTT\n14:25 \nYep. So I know case said that he did 200 last year. He did 200 trainings. So there was 200 training, I think, yeah, 200, yes. So there was 200 trainings done last year, but if we go back before that, we've done a lot more.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n14:52 \nBut that includes macafe when we were part of macafy. So we only have one year of data and if I look at the data based off of just last year of the training that I know that we've taken within Saba for Skyhigh security. I don't have a 1,000 partners and I think that's a bunch of BS. I'm not political. So it…\nRICKY\n15:19 \nI…\nSCOTT\n15:19 \nThe reason why it's so low is because it's so hard to find our content, which that jeopardizes our partner programs and it jeopardize moving forward as an organization. So, this is really, we need to get it out there and do it and do it right? So we have content new content that's actually being made.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n15:41 \nAnd I know that during the first couple of months, we'll probably see a big influx. And then after that, as our partners, a partner side, our partners will start to see the value and we'll start to see what the numbers are, probably even the first year of what it should be, month over month because I know that you can report month over month of hey, on first month, we had 300, month two and three. We had a, you know, 12,000, but in four or five and six and seven, we had say a 1,000. So we wouldn't want to renew like saying for year one of a 1,000 users, year two is 10,000 or 3,000 or 5,000. If we're only getting a 1,000 month over month. Why are we paying for this overage that's so big out there? Does that make sense? Yeah. So we, we'd like to keep that floating number kind of aspect. We would love to see it at 3,000. Trust me if we had 3,003 1,000 partners month over month taking our content, I'll tell you what.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n16:41 \nI'd be happy, Tim, Ricky, you know, I, I'd be happy because that means that the content that we're creating and delivering is very valuable because they want that interaction they want to keep with us. Yeah. But if we only have say a 1,000, then why are we paying for 3,000?\nPricing\nSCOTT\n16:58 \nAnd that's where they're going to come at a, at, in regards to the customers? Yeah. I wanna say, you know, we have millions of customers, but if we saw in the first year, there was only 200 trainings now, are we expecting only 200 trainings next year?\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n17:14 \nHall? No, this year… we're expecting a lot more. And if we can simplify it, I'm thinking probably, you know, 500 customers. Now, are they the same customers? Now? They're not because once a customer takes a class on how to administer their product, then, you know, it's not always the same customer that's gonna take it over and over again unless they're just not getting it, you know, people that skipped or didn't skip the grade. They got held back year over year in school.\nTIM\n17:47 \nThey're not ever getting out of third grade.\nSCOTT\n17:51 \nExactly. So it's and then when we talk about the internal don't know, sorry, you gotta give me a second, my back and clean wanted to start up again. So it's doing this thing. It's housed in the office.\nTIM\n18:06 \nI think we're on the same schedule as your mba.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n18:10 \nYeah. Monday, Wednesday and Friday, it goes and does it stay.\nRICKY\n18:15 \nThere we go.\nSCOTT\n18:18 \nOkay. So… in regards to internal, I would say still, I would say keep it at a 1,000 and that'll hold steady. Probably, you know, that 900 to a 1,000. Basically that should hold steady for at least another year.\nAbout Docebo\nSCOTT\n18:37 \nWe may increase that as, you know, if our company grows blah, blah blah and getting in now, I think would be beneficial especially if we could tie in like a, at least a parent like a two year contract. I, I'd rather stay with, you know, get in, hold it steady and then move forward.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott discussed the number of partners, employees, and customers for their organization. \n• There have been 200 trainings done in the last year and 10,000 partners overall. \n• He hypothesized that due to difficulty finding their content, the number of users has been low. \n• They're expecting 500 customers in the coming year. \n• Internal employees should stay steady with 1,000 and if their company grows they may increase this number.

{"prompt":"SCOTT\n18:59 \nBut… we need to have a price like if you can just spin out a quote, you know, we'll look at this. And then year two is based on numbers of say the last four to six months of averages of not the, so that the employees should not change, should not change year over year. Well, at least for the first two years after that, I don't know… customers should increase, but I can't guarantee that, okay, partners. Well, I'm wanting it to increase but well, we hit 10,000. I don't think we ever will.\nRICKY\n19:42 \nSo, do you think 3,000 is a good place to start from a partner perspective?\nSCOTT\n19:48 \nYear.\nRICKY\n19:49 \nOne.\nRICKY\n19:55 \nI'm just doing the math on all of them, so you got a 1,000 for the employees, five for the customers. And.\nSCOTT\n19:59 \nDidn't even hit a 1,000 last year or this last year in Saba, for partners. Give me one sec. Let me pull a report.\nTIM\n20:08 \nBut they had like you had about one to 3,000… from the other side, right?\nSCOTT\n20:17 \nYes, the Trello side after they're newly created whatever, and I'd have to give me one second. And I might actually be able to give you a number… mind quick… close that one. What's his name?\nSCOTT\n20:42 \nYeah, I see.\nSCOTT\n20:47 \nIt is not there. Let me see the 100. See 3,000.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n21:06 \nSorry, I'm reading through the.\nRICKY\n21:09 \nThat's okay?\nSCOTT\n21:10 \nMultiple conversations that I've had with?\nSCOTT\n21:34 \nAt overage… I'm seeing there they're overage fees and everything. So, I'm just trying to get to where we had a chat. This… is shared, but I'm not seeing it here. He must have sent me an actual email or something and he is.\nSCOTT\n22:00 \nWhere is he? So he?\nSCOTT\n22:08 \nNone better?\nPricing\nSCOTT\n22:34 \nI'm wanting to say he's gonna confirm, you know, the one to 3,000 or something like that, but it wasn't I don't think it was the 3,000 high limit, but I'm just trying to find out his numbers, but he's an hour behind me so I know it's it should be a.\nSmall Talk\nTIM\n22:51 \nI…\nSCOTT\n22:54 \nI don't see him online right now. So I'm like, okay, other than that, I think that… if you can kick out a quote, I know it's Friday and I know it's Margarita Friday because it's close to the weekend, right? But if you can kick me out something that shows like especially when we talk about your, if you want that three year contract and wanting us to sign up for it, we can't go so far out.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n23:21 \nWe're looking at 100 to two or 300,000 dollars because leadership will not buy off on that. They'll like the first year. But hey, we all know that that's you're giving us something that we can stand up, set up for free and then move forward as we move to additional pieces of, you know, on paying for things that you're giving to us for free.\nPayment Gateway\nSCOTT\n23:43 \nIt's kinda like say, but it's like a drug dealer here. Let me, I'll give you this for free. You gotta buy it after that because you're hooked on it now hooked on?\nTIM\n23:54 \nRight. So… so.\nSCOTT\n23:59 \nI'll… and if you show within it like, hey, we're providing this for free.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n24:04 \nBut next year, if, excuse me, if you continue to use it, then you're going to be charged at that cost or whatever. Because I know that there was, you know, the no overage charges for that first year that allows us that Growth and that ability to blow up.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n24:20 \nAnd I think we can sell… that. We're using these other features if we don't use it or if we try to use it and it just, we fall flat on our face because it's not what we were expecting or hoping for it to be. Then we can say, okay, we're going to stop using that because it wasn't working for us or we're not getting… the feature requests that we're looking for because you gotta think the people that are going to be using this for the admin side. We always had a lot to ask just like if you ever put out a product, they always say, well, cannot do this. Well, no, it does. It's not a calculator. It's you know, it's an LMS, it's not a calculator. So, or it's not a bread basket or a bread maker. So, no, you can't make bread with it. We'll teach you how to make bread but it won't make it for you. So the way it falls into play, but I know that there will be some asks once we get it stood up and running.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott discussed pricing for the first two years. \n• Scott discussed overage fees and shared that leadership will not buy off on anything over 100-300,000 dollars.

{"prompt":"SCOTT\n25:18 \nAnd then they're going to Eric's going to be asking about a timeline because he's gonna be I'm pushing heavily that, hey, I want this like last month or last year, but of course, you know, what's the minimum viable that we can stand up what's the cost going to be? And then he'll be looking at well, how they, what are the cost saving factors? Can we put in there? What if we don't do that? So, what if we don't do that, give them a bottom line. This is what it's gonna cost. We're gonna give you all this for free for year one, what you do or don't use in year two, we can come back. But also, these are the numbers we're assuming that you're going to have in year two. So this is what it's gonna cost using all the features. And this was using all the features that we gave you for free in year one, whatever the features were. And then, so that price can change. So we're not signing on for 200,000. Dollars for year two. If we're not going to be using the features, that just makes sense.\nRICKY\n26:12 \nGot it. So, I did want to discuss some of these. It's been a while since we talked. So I wanna make sure that everything that we present to you in the quote is something that you want because things may have changed since December because I know there are some things that you weren't sure if you're gonna use.\nCoach & Share\nSCOTT\n26:29 \nLike the table Shape and the table.\nRICKY\n26:32 \nSo discover coach and share for sure. I think that's gonna be huge.\nSCOTT\n26:36 \nWe're giving our…\nRICKY\n26:39 \nCoach and share is like allowing you to have subject matter experts to interact, have questions.\nSCOTT\n26:45 \nTo see it. But I know that it's not going to be fully implemented for at least three to six months.\nCoach & Share ends\nSCOTT\n26:53 \nI could tell you that right now so that they were not, they're not probably going to be pushing to get that set up for like three to six months. But, and the reason why I say that is because I can keep pushing and feeding, you know, keep feeding the puppy kind of thing.\nAbout Docebo\nSCOTT\n27:09 \nYeah, we have a tech form… in November and the technical form that we used to do year over year at make is that we would go somewhere south of the border and we invite hundreds of our partners in south North America, South America. And we go somewhere in these beautiful areas.\nNext Steps\nSCOTT\n27:31 \nThis time is going to be in November. Normally, it's like, you know, August is when we would go… when we go to tech forum, we do training, it's always some five star full resort, whatever we're there for a week and from seven o'clock in the morning until about six o'clock at night.\nNext Steps ends\nSCOTT\n27:48 \nWe do training. We teach them, you know, on like not on demand training. We actually are in person, we're teaching them how to work with the product, blah blah blah. So it's full course, you know, training that we're doing. Yeah. And then we have like a half day in that week that we basically take off and we go to the beach, but there's a lot of that communication in that… we chat and we actually hold award ceremonies and the whole nine yards. So it's a great event there's a lot of together ness. But after the event, how do we continue that? The ones that we're doing and they're wanting to move forward with our product, how do we keep them engaged? My God, discovery coach and learn or?\nRICKY\n28:35 \nYeah. So.\nSCOTT\n28:37 \nThat's why I would like to have something like that, but I know that they're probably not gonna do anything for like three to six months.\nRICKY\n28:44 \nYeah.\nTIM\n28:45 \nYeah, you can call whenever you want to the expert for the premier partner, you know, whatever social. So this way we'll name it whatever you want. It. That's what it'll be named inside of the platform. And I say really start that engagement and really get people.\nSCOTT\n29:04 \nYeah. And I like that aspect as long as we, and because we could say, and I'm loving this aspect where we could say, hey, on this day, like a tech form, we're releasing this and then we can give them the guidelines for all of our partners. Like we're going to have this if you want to sign up, you go here and you sign up. So in November, when we, if we released it at that point in time, so it's kinda like we can set it all up and kinda like get everything set up and ready, go to the tech form, then release it to our partners, the partners would sign in and then we give them the guidelines. So it was like, look, we're not talking about, you know, customer issues here. We're talking about product specific issues. If you have questions, this is where you go and these are the people that they're now meeting face to face. These are the people that you're going to interact with. And I like that aspect of it because this way you're putting it out there to the partner, a large partner community, not the all of them. And then that would be your test case scenario to see how are they coming in to utilize it? How is it being utilized? And then open it up to the greater, you know, partner organization… just something that I threw out there, you know?\nRICKY\n30:21 \nNo, I love it. And it's good to know because when I go back to our finance team, like I'm gonna have they're gonna ask me these questions as well Shape we could there. I know we had access on the sandbox… definitely new sandbox, I think, yeah, I think that would probably be something.\nSCOTT\n30:41 \nWe, we need test box just to make sure that how it would look coming out because.\nRICKY\n30:47 \nBut also because of the connectors. So like when you're doing connections and stuff, I think that's you absolutely need.\nSCOTT\n30:54 \nAnd then.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott and Ricky discussed the timeline, cost savings factors, and bottom line cost of the project.\n• They also discussed the implementation of \"Coach & Share\", which may take 3-6 months.\n• Scott mentioned their November Tech Forum, which includes training sessions and award ceremonies.\n• They also mentioned setting up guidelines to engage with partners, starting with a test case scenario.\n• Finally, they discussed needing a test box to check how it would look on output and connectors due to connections. END"}
{"prompt":"TIM\n30:54 \nWhat was the other expensive?\nSCOTT\n30:57 \nOne where we were giving a setup for one of our partners. I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think that's going to happen until later like a lot later because… I keep getting to me as being thrown under the bus. So they keep changing things on me and I'm like what, so what they keep changing on me is where things are at or how we're moving forward with things. And it's like wait a minute that just came out of the blue, what, what's going on and the way that they're talking about which partners that we're going after, I would assume that enterprise connect one that would be one that we would wanna make sure that goes to one of our largest partners that help them train them. Yeah, we're trying to get rid of those.\nRICKY\n31:55 \nAnd add on like that is easy because you can add it on at any time.\nSCOTT\n31:58 \nAnd that's…\nRICKY\n31:59 \nGood to know that it's there.\nSCOTT\n32:01 \nMake sure that you hand us the white paper or data sheet on that on the benefits or the, you know, the use cases for it, that would actually help.\nPayment Gateway\nSCOTT\n32:09 \nAnd we can put that to the side to kind of like this is available if we needed at some point in time. And then how we could use it if you had any kind of.\nRICKY\n32:20 \nYeah. At the end of the day, essentially what we call it extended enterprise, what it is, it just gives you a whole new instance but it's still being administered by you. So if you want a wholly new branded different URL, different log in everything.\nSCOTT\n32:34 \nNo, that's in the partner portal, I believe. Does your, no, no, never mind. I was thinking co branding, but that partner portal, sorry, I'm thinking PRM, LMS, I got different things. So.\nRICKY\n32:45 \nPotentially co branded.\nSCOTT\n32:47 \nNo, co brand documentation that's what I was thinking of. So if they.\nRICKY\n32:51 \nOkay.\nIntegrations\nSCOTT\n32:52 \nThey co brand it, but that's supposed to be done a partner portal, which I've got to go talk to one of the directors and a cto about their PRM choice that they did?\nRICKY\n33:03 \nYeah. All right. So then I also got well, the three connectors. So Docebo connect that's the iPad solution. So, are we, and I just wanna confirm what we are connecting? So SFDC?\nSCOTT\n33:15 \nIf it can add multiple connections into a single SFDC.\nRICKY\n33:20 \nSo, it's a, it's an iPad per platform. So if it's connected to fsdc, then you create essentially how it works. It's like Workato, you're creating recipes which is pushing which data you want between the two of them. So you would have one connector for SFDC.\nPayment Gateway\nRICKY\n33:35 \nYou would want a connector for the sandbox. And we do have the bundle of three, which is what we had in that original quote. I think the only thing we were wondering was, do we still need the PRM is that even…\nSCOTT\n33:46 \nHave a partner portal now, partner now channel mechanics?\nIntegrations\nRICKY\n33:51 \nYeah. And I wasn't sure if we needed to connect on it or if you just wanted someone to link out to the LMS, you don't need to connect for that, but it just if you need.\nSCOTT\n33:58 \nWe're just gonna link out because we could be tracking like there's really nothing inside of the, I don't think that there's anything in a PRM that we could actually track other than, hey, can we see that they downloaded xyz file, I mean, but.\nRICKY\n34:13 \nBut that would be in your own PRM. So it just depends on if you want an info passed between the LMS and the PRM, which if you did, then we'd have to look at connect. But if you're just linking someone out, that's literally just a link them out, connect for the sandbox, you definitely need one. Was there anything? Was there another system that you guys wanted to connecting or is it really just SFDC or maybe the HR system for the internal folks too could be, but we can also do that via Automation app, which.\nSCOTT\n34:39 \nThird one to the side. And we can probably push it like when we ask about the connect, the API connectors and with Eric and Nick because they know that there's some other connections that there might need to be because I know the SFDC, but we're probably going to need some type of connection whatever into the ID?\nMobile App\nRICKY\n34:59 \nGot it. I only say I'm only saying for a third because we do have a three connector bundle. So that's kinda like how that works, but I mean, you can go with one.\nSCOTT\n35:08 \nCome on.\nRICKY\n35:12 \nAwesome. Going down the list mobile app, this, you know, you don't think so.\nSCOTT\n35:18 \nI don't think so at, in the beginning.\nRICKY\n35:20 \nBranded mobile app, but I'm just thinking for later on. So if you have partners who hey download our app, you're not bringing them to our app, you bring them to your app. That's the difference. You'll always have a.\nSCOTT\n35:29 \nAnd our marketing might love that later.\nRICKY\n35:33 \nOkay. Later out on.\nSCOTT\n35:36 \nBut do talk about the branded app or the mobile app to Eric to see how he wants to pitch that to marketing or it?\nRICKY\n35:46 \nYeah, just, it's just to let you guys know it's there from the app. Is always there. It doesn't change our app itself. Like you have access to an app. Ours is called Learndot go that's how people can download it. Typically. When we have the external partners, folks tend to want to have their own app living in the store that's really the big difference in your right marketing may want it.\nIntegrations\nRICKY\n36:03 \nThat's pretty much the list for me. So learn S, Shape sandbox extended enterprise later, the connectors, the mobile app, one more thing I did want to talk you about because we did implement not implement. We have a new module if you will because we did talk about analytics last year and what we spoke about was Docebo learning analytics. We now have something called learned data which might be a little more enticing for you.\nNext Steps\nSCOTT\n36:31 \nBring that up on the call. As soon as I bring you into that other call, I'm eight minutes late for another call. So that's like boy.\nRICKY\n36:39 \nSorry about that. You might be interested in the learn data. I'd like to go over it with you.\nSCOTT\n36:43 \nDefinitely. I'd like to hear about it.\nNext Steps ends\nSCOTT\n36:46 \nSo if you can bring that up, actually, can you send me a data sheet or a white paper on not?\nRICKY\n36:49 \nOne. Yeah, for sure.\nSCOTT\n36:51 \nAnd, and I'll read up on that. So this way I can kinda pitch it to the team before and like, and what's the cost on that one?\nRICKY\n36:58 \nI believe that is it goes.\nSCOTT\n37:01 \nAdditional to the business analytics that we already get.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed integrating a payment gateway, connecting to SFDC and a sandbox, linking out to an LMS with PRM, and potentially creating a branded mobile app.\n• They also discussed implementing Docebo Learning Analytics' Learn Data module and Scott asked Ricky to send him a data sheet or white paper on it. END"}
{"prompt":"RICKY\n37:05 \nYeah. So like you're going to get reporting out of the LMS, what learned data is a little different. What it does is it actually pre packages data out of our table learn so that you can then take it into your business intelligence tool already packaged up and ready to be, you know, compared for KPI'S and stuff.\nIntegrations\nSCOTT\n37:26 \nOkay. And I'll find out if we have a business intelligence tool.\nRICKY\n37:29 \nYou need a business intelligence. We'll see if you have like a Tableau or something. What we're doing is we're packaging the data so that it's cleaned up for you guys to just easily now.\nTIM\n37:38 \nYeah. Some.\nRICKY\n37:39 \nDeeper analytics.\nIntegrations ends\nSCOTT\n37:40 \nAnd, and that would be, Nick would know if we have a business, he works in the ops as well. So ops and Lesley admin, so that's what he does. And so this way we can kind of move things around. If we have one. Great if we don't we're thinking on getting one, then we can probably purchase it later on.\nPricing\nRICKY\n37:56 \nAbout 15,000. Okay. Yeah. Awesome. I did want to ask one quick question. I know you got to hop off here because this is going to be asked for me. So if we're going to do the pricing, we're going to look at, obviously we're gonna do multi year from, we'll try to present you multi year. So we're looking at 4,500, maybe year one. Do you envision? Like if we came back at a year two and three where we can increase that number but potentially give you a better deal on it. Do you see like?\nSCOTT\n38:26 \nI see an increase but I don't know the numbers of the increase that's the problem is I don't know what that increase would be and I seriously doubt that it would be a decrease depending upon what we start with on year one.\nRICKY\n38:40 \nYeah, because the first go round was we went from 2,500 with the no overages, then we went to 8,009 1,000. And now I understand that you're thinking it's not gonna go that high but maybe even like a 6,000 on like a good deal or something. Would that be something enticing? I'll talk to my…\nSCOTT\n38:56 \nI'll find out because Eric, Eric's going to reach to me to say what's the numbers and it's like, well, that's the same thing with Casey. How many customers does he assumed that we're going to have this year? Because we can't go back to last year's data or the year before that? All we have is last year's data right now for last year, so.\nTIM\n39:17 \nYeah, I.\nRICKY\n39:19 \nThe last question too. So I understand this is net exam where you got 8,000, you know, with them that's new money that you can now allocate to this. But you're not necessarily tied to that number. Are you?\nSCOTT\n39:31 \nNo, it's they want 80,000 dollars for net exam for us to stand up our own instance for Skyhigh security only for customers.\nRICKY\n39:40 \nOkay. Not even partners, just customers.\nSCOTT\n39:43 \nAnd not even internal.\nRICKY\n39:45 \nOn still using 500 customers.\nSCOTT\n39:48 \nI think they were 500 to a 1,000. I can't remember what they were.\nRICKY\n39:52 \nOkay.\nSCOTT\n39:53 \nBut Casey did the case, did the math and he went through their quoting calculator and everything. And he told, you know, he gave me a number.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n40:00 \nI was like, okay, 8,000 here we go. I need and so, but I have to change… the territorial aspects of, hey, it's pro, serve. This is mine. I want mine and mine only and it's only for me. So go away everybody else to, you need to be open to move forward as a company to grow as it as a business, not your individual personal goals. So that's… my fund all next week. So we, I have to change somebody that's territorial about their business, that they think that we're trying to get rid of them. I'm not trying to get rid of them. I'm trying to bring them in as a group effort to move forward as a company.\nPricing\nRICKY\n40:44 \nYeah. Yeah. Got it. Okay.\nTIM\n40:47 \nIt's a starting point for us.\nSCOTT\n40:49 \nYeah. So it's great to be able to start something like that. That's actually when I'm seeing a price over there that, that's you know, and that's before they start any deals or anything else that's what was quoted based out of their calculator, that's the number that I got.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n41:04 \nAnd I was like, so can I take that money that he says we'll just go ahead and do it with and reallocate that to something else because you have to stand up your own instance. It's not like net exam is just gonna go. Yeah. Well, everything is just here. Now, you still have to transfer everything over regardless because it's a new instance of net exam. Net examined, net examine is still a new instance and you have to stand it up. You're not pulling all the content that's you know, in this other one, it's a different instance under a different company, blah blah blah. So he's thinking that it would just, it's done like, you know, flip a switch and everything is up. It's like, sorry, it's not like that.\nRICKY\n41:44 \nYeah. And actually, you brought me on another point. I don't know if this is be the case here and I think we did talk about it, but you mentioned you want to start from a new, but do you think there's going to be any data transfer between one and the?\nSCOTT\n41:54 \nWe can, we could probably export import ourselves.\nRICKY\n41:59 \nOkay. We do have a service for that, just letting you know. But I do remember we did go over this and you kinda.\nSCOTT\n42:04 \nIt depends on how much data because I don't know the exact numbers, but I am severely late and I know it's a demo.\nWrap-Up\nRICKY\n42:10 \nWe'll let you go. We'll let you go. This is fantastic. If I have any questions I'll reach out which.\nSCOTT\n42:15 \nThanks. I appreciate it, Ricky. Thanks.\nRICKY\n42:17 \nTake care bye, Tim.

So we took it back to our RFP team, but usually, you know, with an RFP, you have your different use cases and from there, you kind of figure out the functions needed, and then you list out the functions and then we kinda, yes, no additional comments, things like that.\nOnboarding ends\nJAG\n1:59 \nYeah, this was more of a use case driven one which is a bit more, you know, more of a custom kind of workflows and user interface. So, I wanted to kinda create a meeting. Everybody kinda get on the same page. We can understand expectations.\nACASILLA\n2:12 \nWhat?\nJAG\n2:13 \nExactly. Our team can work on for you to ensure that all your stakeholders know. Hey, Docebo is the right platform for the job.\nACASILLA\n2:20 \nYeah. So, so basically, I mean we've gone through several demos with you and other vendors and you're very much similar to your presentations of what you guys show, you know, and I know most of it is getting of course to a kind of a generic level of showing it.\nAbout Docebo\nACASILLA\n2:39 \nWe are just again a small group. So… this project here is very high profile within. Even though we're a small group within the company, there's been a lot of pain points with our current LMS. And so that's why we're looking around. So we have specific workflows and expectations that we're looking to meet. And the vendor who best provides that a deal, that example that demo. And it's not just to us, you know, me, Aaron and the service team training team, but it's that selection committee. You know, they're the ones that instigated this to strive to look for a new LMS, they have a lot of pain points on their end.\nAbout Docebo ends\nACASILLA\n3:37 \nAnd so we're really driving this demo to meet their expectations. And whatever you guys wanted how to do to present it in the best light possible. I'm not, you know, saying how you should do it, but again, that's the expectations for this group to simply identify those capabilities and features that your system allows for and to them brings a hot moment in their eyes that's what's gonna get them interested in your platform. So, I know we did things a little different with our use case scenarios based on roles, administrator, and users, and so forth. But that's where we want to lay out that's kind of the expectations that we're looking for anyway, you can do to demonstrate and facilitate that to the best of your capabilities. Then time is gonna be again a benefit towards leaning to one of the groups here. So that's what I guess I can layout for what we're expecting in those scenarios to the best level you can do it. Aaron is my colleague here and this is fan part of the RP team or Docebo.\nAHADLEY\n5:02 \nHow are you doing one?\nJUAN\n5:03 \nNice meeting you, Aaron, good to meet you.\nACASILLA\n5:06 \nAnd so, Aaron, we're just kinda explaining, you know, what our expectations are for the RFP, right? I mean, we've seen these generic type demos showing some of the feature sets that these platforms, various platforms have to offer. But anything that can go beyond that, you really hit home with some of our scenarios again will be to your advantage of us deciding who to go to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jag discussed the RFP, and how it uses use cases to determine functions needed.\n• Acasilla mentioned their group is small, but has specific workflows and expectations for an LMS provider. \n• Acasilla outlined the expectations of the RFP, emphasizing showing features that go beyond generic demos to hit home with their scenarios. END"}
{"prompt":"AHADLEY\n5:32 \nYeah. Our biggest challenge is that… without a kind of scenario based mock up if you will, it's difficult for… our customer inhouse customers… every.\nSmall Talk\nJAG\n5:55 \nI think you might be lagging on it.\nAHADLEY\n5:57 \nDown to the engineer to connect the dots. Hold on.\nACASILLA\n6:03 \nMaybe at some storms over here, guys on it's…\nJAG\n6:08 \nReally bad down there whole lay.\nAHADLEY\n6:11 \nYeah. We're snowed out for sure.\nJAG\n6:15 \nWell…\nAHADLEY\n6:16 \nCan you, is it more fluid than?\nJAG\n6:17 \nMuch better. Much I.\nSmall Talk ends\nAHADLEY\n6:19 \nJust closed a couple of apps real quick. But what I was saying, let me close teams while I'm at it. Hold on one second. Yeah. So, so the difficulty that we have with our in house customers, you know, and this goes all the way chain to the level is with the given context of frustrations, pain points, challenges in the organization. When selecting this new platform, we have a selection committee that we've pulled from the field that go across all, you know, department levels and their ability to connect the dots on concepts is very difficult. So, what we're trying to do is to say, okay, given some examples and mock ups of items that they would be familiar with, right? As it relates to our organization and structure. Even then some of the nomenclature, it doesn't have to be, you know, this comprehensive, we're going to show you every nut and bolt, but more so almost a movie like if watching one of my engineers as a, as an area service manager, when you take that use case scenario, when he signs into the LMS to enroll in a certain learning path, what does that look like? Can I get a five minute or two minute demo scenario that shows that, you know, path? If you will? What does it look like for me as a manager to monitor my entire team? I think that was another use case scenario that alto had put together. And what we try to do in those scenario excel… is to kinda almost put together a screen play or script walkthrough of what these users would have to deal with.\nLayout & Content\nAHADLEY\n8:13 \nAnd can we just get an example, you knowing your system? Can you, can we get an example of what that looks like in a mockup if you will.\nLayout & Content ends\nAHADLEY\n8:23 \nAnd that way, these guys kinda get a taste for this platform because if we tell them, you know, they're so far removed from features and capabilities, especially with new modern platforms. They, they've been so battered by the old, you know, me. And so the, to tell them, yeah, you get some AI, right? What does that look like to them, right? They won't have a clue and… selection committee and there's a lot of items that we want to see as well within our immediate team to say, okay, if I add an engineer who based on these parameters upfront identify that person based on upfront parameters, and then plug them into a certain point in their learning path pipeline. And, you know, what does that look like from a scenario standpoint, again, using some of our nomenclature and structure hierarchies that we tried to outline in that use case scenario, spreadsheet. And so that's kind of really what we're after, I know. It's you know, a lot of details and what have you, but we try to put the details to try to take out ambiguity to say, okay, given the, these insights and contexts, walk us through a case scenario of that, right?\nLearning Plans\nAHADLEY\n9:51 \nWithout having to click on every single button. But more so a case scenario of a person going into the learning path, a person, you know, having multiple paths, being able to test out, you know, a person checking the stats for their team and, you know, Automatic suggestions and homepage, you know, rather than going through features, say this can do, this can do that more.\nBranches & Groups\nAHADLEY\n10:13 \nSo saying here's, a scenario based example of an engineer here's, a scenario based example of the admin here's, a scenario based example of the managers, right? And what they would have to deal with on a day to day on their typical use of this platform, right? As Canon would strategize.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Ahadley outlined a challenge of providing a scenario based mock-up to better help customers understand the platform. \n• The difficulty for the selection committee is connecting the dots on concepts and providing nomenclature and structure hierarchies.\n• Ahadley proposed showing an example of what the platform would look like from the perspective of users such as engineers, admins and managers in order to illustrate features and capabilities. END"}
{"prompt":"ACASILLA\n10:35 \nSo, Jag, I know you showing us some of these things right? In between you me and, you know, we've kind of done a lot of research in the past couple of months to just been familiar with the capabilities of what modern LMS are doing today and the expectations of them. So we as a team, the service team training team, we understand and we can make the leads, right? You guys show us certain things. But for this Audience coming up the selection committee… they don't have the time and don't know all these capabilities and features and expectations. So it's gonna be more of a story rather than a kind of demonstration of certain little features here and there, right? Because again, we know what we're targeting and looking for those specific. But for them, it's gonna really be that continuous a concise story from a to Z that along this journey, it's addressing all these pain points, right? Whether end user like a student would receive, you know, we put the scenario in that with the CE, the student, we call them customer engineers, as we call CE slash student. They're the bulk of our end users. So those guys are the ones that actually are gonna go through the training that's offered on the system. But like in the scenario we put up there, it was like I want that element to identify that person right away when he gets in, obviously show him his current training, but also suggest potential trainings within the setup of his profile.\nCertifications\nACASILLA\n12:20 \nThe data set that comes in from who he is, what he works on, what kind of even legacy transcripts from or over information from our old LMS to say he had all these prerequisites already completed or legacy training that is equivalent to certain prerequisites. And so that way he can bypass a path of what we have for a certain system and get them up to a certain point where he says, now you're here, right?\nCertifications ends\nACASILLA\n12:54 \nIt needs to be simple. So if you can tell the story in the simple concise way that addresses pay points as you go through the journey of the experience of the end users, that's gonna go a long way so that's kind of like we want to let you know that we're telling the same thing to the other vendors. The best you can do to tell that story is gonna I guess benefit you guys?\nWrap-Up\nJUAN\n13:19 \nSo, no, Alan Aaron. Thank you so much for like the background that definitely helps to kind of like understand a little bit more of like the let's say the nature of like… the user experiences that you guys sent over because I mean it's fantastic that you guys have all of that mapped out.\nWrap-Up ends\nJUAN\n13:35 \nAnd that's why we wanted to have a chat with you because typically, this is almost like what we do during implementation. It's like, okay, cool. Tell me the engineer role, what do they do? What do they need? What do they need to see? Perfect? Let's go through the things you're going to have to compromise here. Have you considered doing it this way, this other way, right? So that's why we wanted to discuss with you because this definitely will require, you know, for us to like map out exactly word by word, everything you have there that's what typically takes those eight to 16 weeks. But we do during that implementation is working with you on creating these experiences, right? But sounds like what you guys want is more of to your point, like us telling the story of like, hey, like we got the I'm looking here at the, some of the documents like the administrator or the customer engineer role, right? Like us putting together like a presentation, knowing that, hey, this is not the end result. This is just trying to incorporate all the elements that you gave us and telling the story of like, hey, this is what that user journey will look like. And this is how they can do XYC. And it sounds like it's more of a presentation, right us going and maybe presenting that to the executive team rather than giving you almost like an end product for them to go in and like poke our.\nACASILLA\n14:45 \nAlmost like it'll be like a demo of a short demo of how it's used in a daily situation, you know? And I'm sure you guys have clients that already doing that, right? And so, you know, maybe it's based on sharing an existing live platform that has very similar pain points and audiences. So, I'm not telling you how to do it, but I'm just saying it's suggesting, you know.\nJUAN\n15:16 \nAnd, and that's one of the powerful things about the, you've probably seen already with the conversations with Jack. It can be configured in so many different ways that like we would hate to go in and like put something in front and you and your team thinking that the end result, right?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Acasilla explained that the audience for their selection committee does not have time nor do they know about the capabilities and features of modern LMS. \n• Acasilla suggested telling a concise story from A to Z that addresses all pain points from an end user's perspective (e.g. student or CE) in order to identify the person right away when he/she gets in, show current training, and suggest potential trainings within the setup of his/her profile. \n• Data would come in from who he/she is, what he/she works on, etc., to say if prerequisites already completed or legacy training is equivalent to certain prerequisites so they can bypass a certain path. \n• Acasilla recommended putting together a presentation that tells the story of how the user journey will look like and how one can do XYZ; this could be based on sharing an existing live platform with similar pain points and audiences. END"}
{"prompt":"JUAN\n15:32 \nLike we, to your point, we can show you examples of so many different platforms from customers that have like customer facing examples that you guys can go in and like start an account. And you'll see how this platform looks radically different from this other one, right? Because it… and that's where like we wanted to like just again set expectations of there might be situations where we said like guys, have you thought about doing it this other way?\nLayout & Content ends\nACASILLA\n15:54 \nYeah. And we don't know what we don't know, right? That's the issue when we come to systems. And you guys may have a solution that's totally something great that we never even thought about and, or doesn't in a different way that fulfill that requirement. And that's the situation, right? Again, all these demos that we've seen maybe four or five vendors and you all start looking like in your capabilities. But to us, we now we're at the next level, right? With like saying, okay, show us more, show us more detail. Show us more example, show us more.\nJUAN\n16:32 \nOf…\nACASILLA\n16:32 \nWhat we're on you, we like to see even and it's been again, not that we haven't seen those features but it's again now the Audience that we were going to just needs to have that in a more specific manner in a more growing manner for them to grasp the capabilities and the Power that your system has.\nAHADLEY\n16:55 \nIn, in one, I just want to highlight what you said was spot on. It is truly a presentation demo to an Audience that would actually be using these systems from their user role perspective. And so the area manager, their stake in this, they're going to be part of that selection committee. Is they manage these customer engineer groups, you know, upwards of 30 guys in every area… and they're gonna want to see, you know, I can say there, I think we map this in the spreadsheet. But their biggest pain point is when they have guys of all these different feel for 30 some odd years. And now they have to earn a new system. There's these lengthy certification paths and they struggle to say, to go into our existing LMS to say, okay, you know, customer engineer number one, where does he start? What does he even need? Right? Number one? And the number two, where do I inject them that? And how do I enroll them in the whole nine yards? So, so from that person's perspective, when they sit down in a demo, they're gonna wanna say they want to sit back and eat their popcorn and say, okay here's a day and life of your customer engineer. He just got hired on. And what do you do now? Right? Okay. This is what takes place and just some samples highlighting features that may distinguish disable. Like alto said, we definitely don't know what we don't know. So there's a better way to do something that we've been doing. You know, a different way than by all means highlight that. And I think the case scenario examples are gonna be the selling point to these groups that really touch on their day to day activity. So, from the managers perspective, they're going to want to know, how do I get my guy into the right certification path? How do I monitor their progress?\nLearning Plans\nAHADLEY\n18:47 \nWhere have they been? Where they're at where they're going, right? How do I manage multiple modalities that this person is responsible for, and all of those different paths that they have to progress through? How do I see their competence or mastery of competence of the sub components of these learning paths? Those kinds of things are going to be important. And this to the customer engineer, you know, they, they're going to be taking modules and also injecting themselves into these learning paths. And then we, as admins, we're going to have to try to map, you know, all these moving pieces together. So, you know, I think we have what three or three or four user case scenarios?\nLearning Plans ends\nACASILLA\n19:29 \nThree four, we have one.\nAHADLEY\n19:31 \nIs the Bill made?\nJAG\n19:34 \nBiomed admin?\nAHADLEY\n19:36 \nAre ex.\nACASILLA\n19:38 \nSM, yeah.\nJAG\n19:41 \nSo team what I'm thinking then and an, tell me.\nAHADLEY\n19:44 \nOr service manager?\nACASILLA\n19:45 \nYeah.\nJAG\n19:47 \nSorry, Aaron, you kinda disappeared and came back and I started to.\nAHADLEY\n19:52 \nNo, I get a fluid. So if I start static.\nCustom Reports\nACASILLA\n19:54 \nYou know, one thing is like our current elements has a lot of this data, right? We have transcripts, we have… completion records we have, but it doesn't put it in an elegant way in the reports are clumsy. We want a elegant dashboard. We want a dashboard that the manager can go in and look at his group in this entirety, see the progress of, you know, system curriculums in its entirety, slice and dice it in different ways.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Juan and Acasilla discussed the need to show customers examples of different platforms. \n• Aaron pointed out the difficulty in transitioning to a new system due to lengthy certification paths. \n• They discussed their need for an elegant dashboard to view progress on system curriculums.

{"prompt":"ACASILLA\n20:28 \nSo it really, it needs to connect all the dots, right? And that's what we're expectations are of a modern MS with the so called seo AI, whatever you wanna call it. But connecting all those dots, bringing all that information together in a simple elegant way, having the intelligence to prompt people for, hey, you might want to look at this, right?\nLearning Plans\nACASILLA\n20:51 \nI noticed that you're working on the system, you're making your progress towards this. And when you complete that, guess what the next step is this, right? And then there's a class that opens up in, you know, June, you may want to enroll now because, you know, set your plans up, stuff like that.\nLearning Plans ends\nACASILLA\n21:07 \nWe want that system to do what we've been doing manually with our education coordinators to work with these people and to say, okay, where you're at. But if you let me look up your records, okay. Well, this next is come in here. I'll put you in here. We don't want to coordinate or doing that anymore. We don't want a human doing that anymore. We want the system to do that.\nJAG\n21:32 \nSo question for you, then team. I'm thinking, you know, kind of side lining the RFP. I think this is gonna be more so that, you know, that exact kind of like demo presentation where we tell that story of the four experiences to really highlight exactly what you guys said, right? Like can the system do what we needed to do? So, my question for you then is number one will create that kinda, we'll create the four experiences for you. After this meeting, we have an idea of how we wanna do it. So, my question for you is as, you know, an, and the rest of the team and we're creating the demo. Can we meet a couple of times with you and the team to kinda just confirm, hey, is this what we, is this kind of like the experience we want to create? Maybe you guys can give some suggestions, some tweaks because as you said, right, you, that Audience has specific needs. So if you guys could confirm and validate along the way, hey, we kinda going towards the right goal here and you guys say, yeah, this is exactly what this Audience kinda needs and what speaks to them then we know that, hey, what we created, it's validated, perfect. Let's send this out. How does that sound?\nACASILLA\n22:41 \nI think we can, we could do that up to a point where as we're not giving you too much advantage over the competitors.\nJAG\n22:46 \nNo, just mostly because we want…\nACASILLA\n22:48 \nLocation clarification. Okay?\nJAG\n22:50 \nYeah.\nJUAN\n22:51 \nThe advantage we can, I'll do, come on… like I said before, like this is when we take this approach of like building some of these things that's how we approach as well, doing like when the onboarding, it's like we want your feedback, like.\nACASILLA\n23:08 \nYeah, definitely.\nJUAN\n23:10 \nWe want to make sure that we're going down a path that.\nACASILLA\n23:13 \nYeah, yeah, no, I agree.\nJUAN\n23:15 \nSo that's all we were asking like, hey, like this experience with the engineer, is it look okay? Would you thing remove something? Because I know that sometimes these decisions come to like perception of like why is this button on the right hand corner?\nOnboarding\nACASILLA\n23:27 \nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nJUAN\n23:28 \nI think so, we wanna just validate that. Hey, it's that's a.\nAHADLEY\n23:34 \nWe wanna make sure that you guys have as clear understanding as possible of our inner workings and hierarchy, that, and goal of that, those spreadsheets. So, you know, if there's any questions concerning those things for sure, we can clarify those things and, you know, help lay those things out, you know, because at the end of the day, you know, if there is, we wanna see what disable can do to allow these user experience to flow in the rate that, you know, we think they can, where there might be roadblocks or even other ways to do something.\nOnboarding ends\nAHADLEY\n24:11 \nAnd I'm sure there's things that we're probably doing that we don't need to do because there's some new tool out there just because we've been so jaded by, you know, score in one point two and the old guard of things, right? So I wanna make sure that, you know, we can see a scenario based solution for what we believe we targeted is the day to day activities of these different users.\nOnboarding\nJAG\n24:38 \nAnd so now I just wanted to confirm the scope in time wise team. What are we thinking time wise? When do you want this presentation to happen? Do you want it alive? You know, probably send you videos of all four experiences once we validated that those are the experiences you wanted. When do you want these videos by? When do you want to present this to your leadership?\nACASILLA\n25:00 \nYeah, I think…\nJAG\n25:02 \nAll…\nACASILLA\n25:02 \nThat's on the time line.\nJAG\n25:04 \nSo, the original RP.\nACASILLA\n25:06 \nYeah, yeah. Look at that timeline. We're following those. So first review would be with us, the service training team. And then that kind of lets us look at what you're gonna display and then even having an opportunity, I think I built in the time like a week to find TUNE it. Okay?\nNext Steps\nJAG\n25:25 \nPerfect. So.\nACASILLA\n25:26 \nThat, so you're going to have some time to find TUNE even beyond, you know, when you deliver that demo to us. And so when we look at it, we can say, okay, hey guys, maybe you can do this, is this and then after that week, the review week, then we will go ahead and be ready to start presenting to the committee?\nWrap-Up\nJAG\n25:46 \nFantastic that.\nACASILLA\n25:47 \nSo, if you look at the dates that I have on the timeline and the milestones you'll see those.\nJAG\n25:53 \nPerfect. Awesome. Any questions from you? Juan? I am good on my end?\nJUAN\n25:59 \nNo, I think that that's very helpful, Aaron. And although I appreciate you kinda like taking some time, I know this is not the fun part of having to deal with all the vendors and as we got, but we really, I don't know, we really want to earn your business.\nWrap-Up ends\nJUAN\n26:15 \nSo like anything that we can do to like just get better, more clarity on like the requirements and make sure that we also wanna make sure that we're making you guys look good in front of the committee, right? So appreciate your time. That's all I want.\nACASILLA\n26:29 \nYeah, I mean, it's not only our kind of reputation is right on it, but also theirs because of these liked it. And then, you know, the field.\nWrap-Up\nJUAN\n26:36 \nSure.\nACASILLA\n26:37 \nDoesn't react positively. It's on them too. So we're in this team. I appreciate your time, guys.

It's Friday sounds like a busy morning.\nLETA\n0:11 \nI know it's been crazy.\nSCOTT\n0:14 \nI feel like it always is for you.\nLETA\n0:16 \nYeah, it is. I'm afraid.\nSCOTT\n0:18 \nYeah, I think our business is probably different though me. I'm like sitting on the laptop and picturing you having to do a lot of running around, but I don't know if that's true or not.\nLETA\n0:26 \nYeah, I spend a lot of time. I don't know why I chose an upstairs office but I did, and everything that I need is always either upstairs or downstairs, so it results in, you know, not bad as far as activity level however.\nSCOTT\n0:47 \nYeah, you need to get the apple watch going or.\nSmall Talk ends\nLETA\n0:49 \nGo.\nSCOTT\n0:52 \nBut thanks for connecting. I just had a couple swamped days after a demo, so I know I sent a couple of resources and I'm like, I'm sure I owe them a few more things and I know we got to schedule some next steps, but I want to see they shared any general thoughts with you. How it went.\nLETA\n1:11 \nYes, they did. And it was extraordinarily positive across the board. Thomas said he was very impressed. Dale did the same thing and said that he thought that it was… that it looked like it would be something that was gonna be an amazing benefit. I mean, I got really good comments even down who is probably the hardest one to get to, you know, give you any kind of positive feedback was positive about it as well. So, I think it went really well. I actually, I don't think, I know it went really well… what they would like to have. And it was the one thing I think that Thomas questioned you about towards the end was the references he wanted to get those. And I guess pricing was the big one.\nSCOTT\n2:08 \nYeah. I was gonna say, I think we're do for that. What else did I include here? I sent over the recording, I sent the, access to the demo and the content library. So I'm not sure if Dale wants to get in there and check anything out. Okay? But yeah, either way, I mean it's definitely probably good for us to regroup on pricing. I mean, I think you got a general sense of like what we do want to include and what we don't but we could even like go over a quick list just to make sure we're on the same page going into it. Okay? Is that a conversation for you and I to have or is like you have to present pricing up to like, I guess who's the key stakeholder that's kind of stakeholder on? Okay, perfect. Because maybe it makes sense for us just to meet the three of us and just kinda go over what your options are.\nLETA\n2:59 \nThomas and Dan, probably. Yeah, I think that would be a good idea if we could meet. But is there anything that you can give me that I can present to them or do you think that it's something that would be better handled? You know, with you part, you know, doing that part of it?\nSCOTT\n3:18 \nNo. You know what? I think we should know, at least you and I go through it once too. So that way like you can decide like, hey, this is like what we recommend you have like different like user tier options. We've got a few different options to consider. And then obviously part of that has to go into the budget considerations like where do you start with us? Versus like where do you grow? Because you don't have to start with content. Like if Dale is really happy with JJ Keller, but, you know, if you look at it and there's budget and there's a really strong use case I need then, you know, maybe we do want to include it. So let me just see. I kinda just pop this on your radar to do like a quick 15 minute check in today, pull up some pricing or do you wanna book like a separate time and like actually sit down and.\nLETA\n4:06 \nLet's book a second separate time where you and I sit down and, you know, we have an opportunity plus I really need to have a chance to kinda sit down and think of Scott. I want it all.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n4:20 \nYeah, I think it's like how do we help you make that business case?\nLETA\n4:23 \nBut when I made my presentation to the capital projects, I was kinda thinking the 50,000 where I think we put it and we talk about that number. I mentioned that. Yeah. Okay. So I'm thinking that's where if we have to go to 49,999 and 99 cents, let's do that. Okay?\nSCOTT\n4:47 \nYeah. So I think like for you and I let's sit down and let's see how we get the most out of all that. I know we lasted pricing gosh, probably on like October, maybe in September, right?\nLETA\n4:59 \nYeah, it's been a 1,000 years.\nSCOTT\n5:01 \nThe good news is nothing's changed all the pricing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Leta said general thoughts and feedback were positive across the board. \n• Thomas wanted reference materials, pricing was the big issue mentioned \n• Scott suggested meeting the three of them to discuss options and pricing \n• Leta thought it would be good to meet with Scott first and plan before presenting to Thomas and Dan END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n5:03 \nSo there's no surprises there. I'm sure I gave you that number based on including most things. Okay. Yeah, let's just review it. And one thing I like to do for you as well is we'll create a little like pricing grid with I do like a little mini video attached to each section. That way, they just kinda know like, okay, like what does this line item mean? Like what are we paying for? I think it's just easier for you to present internally to.\nLETA\n5:28 \nOkay, perfect. That'd be great.\nSCOTT\n5:30 \nSo we'll do that. And then I think some of the other like common things we do have, I think I presented a little bit of like onboarding and support, but I know there were some questions there. I think it's always good at least for like, you know, whoever is going to be kind of core on the project to kinda see an overview of expectations, some of the tools we're going to get you in and like what the actual process looks like. But if we want to do that after pricing, we can do that too.\nLETA\n5:56 \nOkay. Yeah, that sounds good.\nSCOTT\n6:00 \nAnd then where are you guys at? I know you mentioned it was sort of like was there like end of March, there was an audit going on that was kind.\nLETA\n6:09 \nIt's it's actually. And I got some more information on that today. So this was perfect that we met now rather than earlier. So it is an end of your audit that takes place. And then once that is finished, which is usually in April and should be in April is what Thomas told me. Then everything will roll out where they start with the capital project stuff in may. So now we know now we at least have some kind of time frame.\nPricing\nSCOTT\n6:39 \nYeah, no, that's good. And we've got some flexibility too. So one thing I think when we sit down and do the pricing piece two, if there is like a path to, you know, potentially like contracting or signing in March, it's technically like RQ1. So sometimes there's pricing incentives which, you know, maybe we can just get you more within that 50,000 if it makes sense.\nPricing ends\nSCOTT\n7:03 \nAnd we want to take advantage of it. We can because you can actually book the start date. Like if we wanted to say may fifteenth was the start, you can still capture some of those price adjustments and start when it makes sense for the budget. But if they say, you know, what we need to wait like that's okay too if we can't take advantage of the.\nLETA\n7:22 \nSo quarter one pricing incentives.\nSCOTT\n7:25 \nOkay. Got it. Yeah, it's just kind of our team. I mean, we're a public company. So as we get to end of quarter, so like how do we get everything we can, you know, to sign within March rather than waiting to support for reporting? But it really doesn't affect you. So it's more like if it's realistic. Great. If it's not, you know, we'll wait. So.\nLETA\n7:47 \nOkay. That sounds good. There was one question that Jamie actually had and he remembered it after we had signed off the other day. So we're looking at a group it's called visit VI six and it is to put together these digital boards throughout the facilities so that we can, you know, post KPI boards, we can post balance score cards. We can do information from HR. Like if HR says one like, you know, it's enrollment time. It's basically a board that's a communication board. And they wanted to, he wanted to know if there was a way that we could actually do some of the, if Docebo could be worked into utilizing those boards. I told him that would probably be more for the visits people than you guys. But I thought I'd just ask it just in case you might have some idea.\nSCOTT\n8:47 \nThat won't be new for me and I'm on their website. Now, I mean, there could easily, I don't know what they do on their side, like if they record videos and then post them, or if it's like live feeds of dashboards like I.\nLETA\n9:01 \nYeah, they actually have software that we would either purchase or subscribe to and they, we could either they would host all the data like for our KPI boards in their cloud service and then we could just take an update it with our information or we can keep it all internal, which I think if that would be the better thing. And then I'm thinking I would be able to put some kind of connection. We ought to be able to figure out some way to put a connection with the Saba for like… maybe saying that it would post up on the KPI boards that these people achieve their training goals and they've earn these badges or something like that. I think that's what he was thinking about.\nSCOTT\n9:43 \nThat's what I was gonna wonder to like a learning leader board or something like that. Yeah. So I mean, I think there's definitely like ways to do it whether that's data coming out. And now on a website called optisince, but that's not what you said.\nLETA\n10:02 \nNo visit. Yeah, BISIX.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott suggesting creating a pricing grid along with mini videos attached to each line item to make it easier for Leta to present internally.\n• After discussing suitable dates and quarter one pricing incentives, the conversation shifted towards Visit VI Six; an software that can be used to post KPI boards, balance scorecards, and communication boards. \n• Jamie asked if Docebo could be worked into utilizing those boards and suggested connecting Saba with the KPI boards to post when training goals are achieved or badges are earned. END"}
{"prompt":"SCOTT\n10:07 \nHeaded up on a web page that was sign versus here we go. I'm looking at the right thing. But… yeah, so I think like, you know, whether it's like data coming out, pushing to their software or if they just wanna like do something like with an I frame and like, you know, show the, or pull some of our visual reports if you want to show like a Branches dashboard or like a department dashboard and complete.\nCustom Reports ends\nSCOTT\n10:32 \nLike, so I say the answer I'd say is probably, but it would probably mean like we need to sit down and see what their capabilities are, like what's the best way to do it.\nLETA\n10:45 \nAnd I'm thinking that it's going to involve our it people as well. So anyway, I just thought I'd throw it out there. So you could kinda have that on your radar because that may be coming at you in another meeting.\nSCOTT\n10:56 \nThat's okay. And if there's like, I mean, I don't know if they just post like images or message boards but like if you've got like a new program you're launching like I'm sure you could like take, you know, videos or screenshots of Docebo or your university that you create to post on something like that.\nSmall Talk\nSCOTT\n11:14 \nBut again, I think there's room to be creative. Okay? Cool depending on what they do. So, so that's good. Okay. So we got a bit of a window here. I think, are you okay or Friday today? How's your week next week? Are you?\nLETA\n11:30 \nSo, the one thing that I can always count on working for all smoke is that… it's always fun and exciting.\nSmall Talk ends\nLETA\n11:40 \nWe are in the process, we have the two bottling locations and Newport… is the, what we call the plan of the future. It's the largest facility that we have a smaller facility in pitman center, which we are now transitioning to reducing the number of shifts at that facility and bringing all the people over to the larger campus… the.\nNext Steps\nLETA\n12:10 \nSo right now I'm was put made point person for doing the transition for the team at pitman to get them over here to Newport. So it's been a bit of a crazy time next week is probably the best time for me to, for us to schedule a meeting because… quite frankly we just finished one group of transitions and then the next one won't begin again until late March or April. So if we're gonna take this opportunity, let's do it.\nSCOTT\n12:42 \nYeah. Okay. My Monday, I mean, I've got time there, but Tuesday is almost wide open. Anything other than 11 a. M… if you've got.\nLETA\n12:53 \nAt my calendar.\nSCOTT\n12:57 \nAnd I could have had this prep for today, but yeah, just give your check in.\nLETA\n13:02 \nScott, no, don't even worry about that. Okay? So for you, just you and I would be good. Would you say what day was out Tuesday at 11? Tuesday?\nSCOTT\n13:16 \nTuesday, 11 is the only time I can't do. Any other time is open on Tuesday. Okay. So I'm…\nLETA\n13:20 \nGood. Any other time, but three 30, I have a HR thing.\nSCOTT\n13:26 \nOkay. Do you wanna do morning then?\nLETA\n13:27 \nYeah, let's do morning.\nSCOTT\n13:29 \nI'll just send you one for 10 am.\nLETA\n13:32 \nOkay. That's perfect.\nSCOTT\n13:39 \nAnd I'll just go back. I'll do our past call. I'll pull up all the pricing info I originally sent you.\nNext Steps ends\nSCOTT\n13:44 \nSo I have all that, and from there, we can get you like a version of like what a contract looks like too. So that like your team, can, you know, when you presented to Thomas, it looks a little bit more official.\nLETA\n13:57 \nThat's flawless that's perfect.\nSCOTT\n13:59 \nAnd that should get the ball rolling. I know when they brought this back to you, they sort of said, you know, hey obviously like sounds like the table as a really great fit, but also like we're gonna make sure we're making, you know, an educated decision and, you know, exploring things in the market too. Is that still a path they're heading down? Or did you ended up doing like a couple of calls with different vendors or where you sort?\nLETA\n14:21 \nYes. So that's the, they, they've had me doing my research and Thomas was interested again about the references. If you can get us some of those Berlin packaging is a big one. And I believe he said that, you know, that was one that he'd be interested in looking into.\nSCOTT\n14:47 \nYeah. I actually, I brought them on myself which is why I brought them up. That was just perfect timing that they, that you guys partner with them. Let me reach out to them. I haven't talked to them probably about a year or so. So. Let me make sure I know folks move around, let's see if my…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Scott and Leta discussed the possibility of Scott's team providing custom reports to Leta’s team.\n• They agreed that it would require sitting down and determining the capabilities on both sides.\n• Scott suggested they use visuals such as sample dashboards or screenshots of programs to post on sites like message boards.\n• Leta is working on transitioning team members from a smaller facility in Pitman Center to Newport, their largest facility; this transition won't begin again until late March/April, so she suggested scheduling a meeting soon.\n• Scott suggested having all the pricing info and contract details ready for Thomas before the meeting. \n• Leta requested references from Berlin Packaging.

{"prompt":"LETA\n15:06 \nAbsolutely. And just, you know, maybe two more or something like that. Something that we can, he just wants to Thomas is one of those that does his due diligence. Is why he's now vice president of the company.\nSCOTT\n15:21 \nYeah, of course. And let me pull them up. I know they were using our content too. So, yeah, I'll reach out to them. I'll get that going. I've got a couple of other in the manufacturing space that I'll reach out to as well, but I think would be good references. And then got, we've got like a general way of like going through like our, just like our account management team to request references. They're a little bit more sticklers about like, hey, like we've got like only so many accounts we can bug all the time to give references. So we typically one. But if I use one of theirs, and then I've got, you know, Berlin and a couple more that I brought on. I think we should be fine there.\nLETA\n16:07 \nPerfect.\nSCOTT\n16:09 \nAll right. So, I think we're good. Anything else from your side or anything else we should?\nLETA\n16:14 \nI can't think of anything I think that we kinda… between the two is over this lengthy time period. We've talked about a lot haven't, we…\nSCOTT\n16:25 \nI know. Yeah, I mean, lots change too.\nSmall Talk\nSCOTT\n16:29 \nI mean, I'm kinda open to sharing stuff, but we just found out that we're having our first kid too, so.\nLETA\n16:37 \nCongratulations. That's wonderful.\nSCOTT\n16:39 \nSo, it's been a busy week with that too. We've actually been, we had to go through ibf so it's been a long journey, but we're just super excited so.\nNext Steps\nLETA\n16:46 \nAwesome.\nSCOTT\n16:47 \nWe gotta wait till September sixth now going. So, yeah. So as long as, you know, we're still working together. Hopefully we're all sealed up by then, but maybe you'll have a baby on my lap at some point here.\nLETA\n17:00 \nThat would be awesome.\nSCOTT\n17:03 \nAnyways, the only thing I was thinking of as I'm kinda going through my list here is just the content side. I know Dale had maybe a couple of questions there. Our content team like they're great to meet with. It may be worth just like introducing them for a 30 minute call. I know Dale is got a busy schedule. It's hard to get a hold of. So maybe we just want to float that option out there because they can probably add a lot more value in terms of like just specific vendors that will do, you know, well in your space like publishers that we have in our network.\nNext Steps ends\nSCOTT\n17:34 \nIt's more just for education. So we don't have to do it. But if the options there, if Dale wants to.\nLETA\n17:39 \nYeah, I think he would, I absolutely think he would. Okay. No, he is still here. He's over, we're installing a brand new… still, which is the distilling column and he's over there.\nNext Steps\nLETA\n17:55 \nThey're welding on that. So when they're doing anything around alcohol, he has to be there on site but I'm not gonna go over and try to bother him and ask him to set up a meeting today. So let me do this.\nSCOTT\n18:07 \nYeah, not today. I was going to send you some times for next week.\nLETA\n18:10 \nMaybe I might bring him in… a meeting that we have on Tuesday if he's available.\nSCOTT\n18:18 \nLet me extend this to an hour them… and I'll put a note out to my content team.\nLETA\n18:27 \nJust let me find it. Let's not, you know what? Let's let me?\nSCOTT\n18:32 \nYeah, no. So rush, I'll just put a placeholder you and I meet on that.\nNext Steps ends\nLETA\n18:37 \nAnd then I'll him in. I got your invitation. I'll we'll bring him in on that later with the content team because, you know, you and I've got a ton. So does he?\nSCOTT\n18:50 \nYeah, perfect. I mean, that's fine. He's got access to self explorer too. So it's just a little more guidance as add value.\nWrap-Up\nSCOTT\n19:01 \nBut anyways, I will let you get back to it. But that's awesome. I'm glad the feedback is so good. I'm excited to get this ball rolling. Yeah. And hopefully we can figure it a way to get this done in March and into April and may.\nLETA\n19:14 \nAll right. That sounds great. Scott.\nSCOTT\n19:16 \nCool. All right.

{"prompt":"ALEX\n5:04 \nSo you could literally search anything and can pull up a gift or make slides really pop. Like I'm just starting out. I only like I delivered a presentation using it, but like for five minutes and people are like, wait, what, what's happening right now? What is going on? Like he's in his face, is in the slides. So, yeah.\nSmall Talk\nDAILA\n5:26 \nI love it. I love it. Well, thank you. Thank you for reminding about that. Like I said, now it's on paper. So now it's like it's really.\nALEX\n5:33 \nNice.\nDAILA\n5:34 \nGonna look it up. So cool. Okay. Yeah. So moving right along again, I know that it seems like, you know, you're probably out in the satellite like waiting and waiting for, you know, the water to boil. I promise it's simmering, it's getting there. So, you know, again just have lots of not lots but good amount of back and forth with the Pia folks. I just, they're just funny and, you know, we kind a chuckle and we like sure we can do this for you.\nSmall Talk ends\nDAILA\n6:09 \nBut, you know, now they wanted a diagram of some of the manual processes that we do that have nothing to do with their to, it won't have anything to do with their CEO, but they're like well, but there's data that's flowing and I'm like not going anyway, whatever long story short went back. We created some diagrams to show about how we create a spreadsheet and we upload it to this other website that's completely outside of the LMS… and then they wanted to hear back on this other question from procurement about some language in the MS. So anyway, in that information.\nSmall Talk\nDAILA\n6:46 \nSo again, we're you know, we're moving through the paces. This is normal. This is just how it is. I have heard about this process long before I ever started it from my good friend who works here and just said, good luck. You know, it's not fun but everyone's been real nice and real forthcoming and I've played the new, you know, like I don't know what I'm doing is very first time.\nOnboarding\nDAILA\n7:09 \nSo just tell me. So it's good because that's kinda made them a little bit more endeard towards me. So we're moving through all of that. I just got, it was funny. I asked you for the copy of the nda because the nda team got back. I was like, hey, did they ever accept our red lines?\nOnboarding ends\nDAILA\n7:25 \nAnd I was like, I guess I should have told you that, yes, that is all done. It is signed it crossed off the list. So, and they just had to have a copy for their records. They're kinda out of the process now. So, so that is good. Another, what I think is a big win this week is that… we have, did I tell you the basically for our E learning, we currently use the WalkMe teach me platform to.\nALEX\n7:57 \nThank you. I think we did.\nDAILA\n7:59 \nYeah. And I mean teach me as you clearly know, it's not an LMS, you know? And that's what before we started this whole thing, they were trying to kinda shove us into that. And we were like, it is not gonna give us anything that we need. And so then as this has drug on, then there was this thing like, okay, well, can we, you know, somehow put this in teach me as an interim step before if, you know, we move it into the LMS, so that at least we have something and we keep momentum up and that type of thing.\nAbout Docebo\nDAILA\n8:31 \nAnd… I was really concerned about that… just because I thought that it would set false expectations for what we'd be able to achieve because I mean, we have been blasting this whole like initiative from the rooftops of what we're going to be able to do and all of the data and all of the, you know, retention and reduction of churn and blah blah blah.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAILA\n8:54 \nAnd I'm like, no, that's gonna happen if we try to shove some of this into teach me, you know, like this is not the way to do this. And so we kinda had to work through this checks and balances, if you will. My boss's boss feeling like we've been doing something over the last, you know, five months. But at the same time not saying don't worry, you know, we've been able to do this. So now we can rest, you know, I've tried to walk that fine line and I think that we got to a place this week where it is very apparent that okay, we can use some of the E learning content that we've developed. So check off the box of, hey, we've done something and we're able to use it, but without trying to shove the whole design of the new program and to teach me so that there is still a very large carrot out there saying, no, we absolutely need to keep up the urgency of moving forward with getting through all of this vendor management stuff because I didn't and not that I was worried that they would stop with TeachMe? But I was worried that they would use that as an excuse to slow down if that makes sense.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Daila has been engaging in conversations with those involved in the onboarding process and creating diagrams to illustrate manual processes.\n• Daila expressed concern about using TeachMe as an interim solution, due to potential false expectations from stakeholders. \n• The team discussed using E-learning content developed previously, but agreed that urgency was needed in completing vendor management tasks.

{"prompt":"ALEX\n10:08 \nAnd are you keeping, teach me like for certain things?\nDAILA\n10:12 \nTeach me? No, it will go away. We have a contract right now that I think last another year or two, WalkMe is not going away. We're gonna keep WalkMe, but teach me which is a little offshoot walk me that will eventually go.\nALEX\n10:30 \nYeah.\nDAILA\n10:30 \nOkay.\nALEX\n10:31 \nYeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.\nDAILA\n10:35 \nSo, yeah. So that has happened this week and I don't know if that sounds big to you, but it was big for me. So.\nALEX\n10:43 \nTo realize, hey, we don't yeah, we can't just shove everything into this is okay. All right.\nDAILA\n10:51 \nSo, you know, we're continuing to move down the path.\nAbout Docebo\nDAILA\n10:54 \nI think I had mentioned to you either, you know, in a side comment or maybe in an email that we now have interest outside of our business unit, that people are starting to talk about this. We also have a team that what were they called? I think they were called the product adoption team and they just got rebranded into the customer relationship management team, which again is huge because now, you know, we're starting to really kinda groove together under our strategic pillar for this year, which is all about, you know, retention and, you know, focusing on our core product and getting people engaged with it and that type of thing.\nAbout Docebo ends\nDAILA\n11:38 \nSo everything is really rolling up nicely to really support and envelop the business case. And what I'm starting to see and hoping that I continue to see is instead of us pushing it's almost now we're starting to get that pull, you know, whereas kind of like when it is coming, what are you, what is your solution to this? What are you doing? Versus like, you know, we need this, so.\nALEX\n12:02 \nI…\nDAILA\n12:02 \nThink our patients is gonna pay off. I think, I know your question is going to be all about timing. I still don't have a firm answer on that, but I would say that I don't I would be surprised if we get to any type of signature before June to be quite honest.\nSmall Talk\nALEX\n12:23 \nWow. Okay.\nDAILA\n12:24 \nWhich is probably not what you wanna hear, but I'm just trying to be really.\nALEX\n12:27 \nYeah, that's good. But yeah, that's good to know. Okay.\nDAILA\n12:33 \nI feel kinda good about June, but I, you know, I'm gonna say that so that if something happens sooner than that, we're like.\nSmall Talk ends\nALEX\n12:41 \nExcited.\nDAILA\n12:42 \nBe surprised… but that, that's what I would say just based on what I've seen and what I've heard from others who have gone through a similar process with the technology cool?\nALEX\n12:55 \nOkay… are like the big like, so in terms of like the big things, the steps from here, like the two things, the security review, do you like have any sense of when you think they'll… be like completed with that or you think there is going to be more things that come down. I know you asked about the dpa, I don't know if that was like a huge deal breaker for them.\nDAILA\n13:22 \nYeah. I mean, and it, you guys cannot be the only technology that we use that has up data out.\nSmall Talk\nALEX\n13:31 \nSomewhere things.\nDAILA\n13:32 \nLike come on. So I think it's just them like having to feel like they fought the good fight, you know, in order to resolve the situation. So I don't know and it's a big black hole. No one knows. I do know that the last round of questions was fewer than it was the previous time.\nSmall Talk ends\nDAILA\n13:54 \nI think we were down to like three questions which is good and I was able to, you know, respond to them within a couple of days and get those questions fired off, you know, our answers fired off. And then we'll come back around. So it continues to move. It's not like it's just sitting there. People are actively reviewing it and asking questions and looking at things. So that's good. I know that they're also because we have the Pia people and then we have the vendor management people and I know the vendor management to two different teams.\nOnboarding\nDAILA\n14:30 \nSo I know the vendor management people are in the process of looking at the MS right now. So I would think that next week we can expect any red lines that they would want added to the msa to come through, which will be good again across as everything off as we continue to go. So.\nOnboarding ends\nALEX\n14:50 \nYeah. And then the, any updates on the presentation to Frank or the new business case or I?\nDAILA\n15:00 \nNo, not yet. We're still working on that. I did meet with Linda this week and I reviewed the business case with her. I'm waiting on some data from the coaching team to put in there. So they're gathering that they've had… they've got two managers and one of them has been off on pto for the last couple of weeks. So it's been a little difficult for them to kinda manage everything.

Okay here's, you know, like me maybe me and Stephanie with you first and just say, hey, this is what we would recommend.\nWrap-Up ends\nALEX\n16:28 \nThis is like taking out the Salesforce, this is putting in the Professional services. This is what I think. Like this is our best, you know, like guests and recommendation based on where you are today. And then we take that to Linda together. And then, you know, see what she, if she may, you know, do the whole like, hey, can you give me different bands or different, you know, show me different years or something? But at least we know like this is like what we feel like you would go with and, or, you know, should go with and, you know, see what she would want to negotiate from there. Just so we're not like, you know, we're making up some time. I don't know if she'd be open to at least starting those talks at all?\nDAILA\n17:13 \nI will ask for that. I will meet with her next week. So, so, yeah, I put that on the list to ask her. I think that's a good question and, you know, so.\nALEX\n17:27 \nBecause then we could get give her an order. Like if we get that started like and like I don't know if there's back and forth or whatever.\nOnboarding\nALEX\n17:34 \nBut then we can agree like, hey, this is what we want to go to the business with. We're spending this much. This is what the packages here's the order form of what we'd be signing. This is what like, you know, your vendor management team is eventually gonna, they're probably already asking questions like where is the order form or where's the exhibit? And we haven't had that yet because we haven't really agreed to commercial terms. So… yeah, you know, that may be some of their questions as they review the like, can you send us your order form or exhibit or whatever? So.\nDAILA\n18:08 \nYeah, yeah, absolutely. And you know, another thing too that is gonna help drive urgency here is that and I think this is another win because this is not what they were gonna do but we're not going to announce to our clients that we've done anything to revamp our training that we have, you know, done anything to make their experience better.\nOnboarding ends\nDAILA\n18:30 \nBecause I was like, I'm not gonna do that, you know, because we're only delivering like this pity little thing. I don't wanna make a big deal out of it and then have them be annoyed and then make big deal when we launch the full version in an LMS. So… so they agree that, yeah, we won't say anything. So again, it really puts some urgency under them because they're starting to see more and more that clients are asking for this and that doing it is a big, you know, it helps the bottom line. It has a big impact. So we're working at.\nALEX\n19:11 \nI was thinking of something else just to maybe get some more momentum. Did I ever do… like a promo video of the LMS or a microsite that like kinda listed some of the things from us? Do you remember seeing anything like that from me? I'm trying to search it right now but I don't know if I ever did.\nDAILA\n19:34 \nI don't know. I know we did like during the initial demo, like we had kind of that setup and we kinda walkthrough what it looked like, but I don't…\nALEX\n19:46 \nOkay. Let me actually. So, so our marketing team will make like a it's like a website just with like a few things about the partnership like here's, some case studies, and here's like a… you know, a description of learn and here's like, you know, message from our CEO and reviews on G2. And sometimes I think this would warrant it. Sometimes we make like a minute video and I actually put something we put on you to, but we can make it private but, you know, send it to you and it's kind of like just like a cool little like promo video of your, the site we made for you. Some of the key features of it. If there's music behind it and people get Jazz like even if you, if you've ever seen it, you're like, is this is what we're gonna move to? Like we're gonna go towards this is cool. Like, yes, like when is this happening? So it gets people excited.\nDAILA\n20:40 \nLove it. And we could include that in the business case too, so they could link out and they could see that… if we get it in time, I don't know how long it takes to make something like that. You know, another thing too. Just as you were talking, one small section of the business case talks about like down the road like, you know, things, features, cool things that are not in scope right this second, but.\nALEX\n21:04 \nThey…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Alex and Daila discussed onboarding negotiations with Linda, including the proposed recommendation and proposal.\n• They discussed the possibility of producing a promo video to help demonstrate key features and promote the partnership to clients.\n• They mentioned other items that could be included in a business case for the onboarding process. END"}
{"prompt":"DAILA\n21:04 \nWould potentially be down the road. And one of the things that I think we talked about briefly early on was how to leverage the data from Docebo in Salesforce to help inform account managers or other sales related people about actions they may wanna take based on activity in the LMS, and, you know, those actions could be, you know, if there's a way to identify people who are at risk because they've dropped off, like they haven't engaged in learning in X amount of time, right? And so, maybe we want to reach out and just kinda be like, hey, you know, blah, blah. Maybe it is that I'm just making this up. I don't know what's possible. Maybe it is a way to be like, wow, you know, they really access a lot of trainings about this topic and maybe the license that they have doesn't have that topic.\nPayment Gateway\nDAILA\n22:03 \nSo maybe this is an opportunity for an upsell or cross sell or whatnot, because our different licenses have different access to different features in the platform. So, I feel like we briefly talked about that before I would like to mention something. And again, it's just a, like a bullet point, but I would like to mention something… in the business case if there is that ability to somehow leverage that data.\nPayment Gateway ends\nALEX\n22:34 \nThere is. So, let me… so like… I don't know how to kind of talk about this or present this but, you know, ironically. So we launched things every month. We have a new product releases, something about our platform changes. And I a big, you know, we haven't launched. You know, I don't know if we launched like an actual product last year, but we launched a lot of like updates to our core LMS and different already existing ones. But this past month, we was like our first product launch in a long time and it was something it's basically… it's a tool that allows you to extract learning data from your LMS and then pump it into to your business intelligence tool.\nIntegrations\nALEX\n23:21 \nIt basically cleans the data up from learning. And then without the use of like doing multiple like thousands of API calls which can be done and can be set up. It's just a large lift on like an it standpoint. It basically uses a tool that we have like you may have already, but it uses a data warehouse called snowflake that we use internally and then we give you access to. So you're able to extract it out and then make it clean on your end to visualize it in a tool like I think you use Looker, you know, internally.\nIntegrations ends\nALEX\n23:52 \nSo like, you know, theoretically picture a day where you could like log into Looker and compare like learning data and for other performance data or revenue or adoption.\nDAILA\n24:05 \nRight.\nALEX\n24:05 \nYou know, like, yeah, turn rates or something like that, right? Or health scores like that. There would be a way to do that in just a more seamless way than doing, you know, like a heavy lift of an, it let's say, so that's something I might, you know, think about including maybe I could send you some signs on it.\nIntegrations\nALEX\n24:28 \nAnd as far as like the Salesforce piece, I think that would probably maybe even eventually be like something like connect or something like how we visualize. Yeah, I just think like all those things are or multiple different custom workflows because, yeah, I think that like theoretically those things could be possible where you're notifying somebody, but we'd have to like pull ways of how you identify those people and, you know, how your Salesforce is set up.\nIntegrations ends\nALEX\n24:57 \nSo that would just be scoping. But yeah, like that's definitely something you're thinking like along the lines of like, you know, how you can grow with the system and that's good. You do buy, you wanna buy a system that a two years from now, when you wanna do that you have the ability to do that you're not running into all.\nDAILA\n25:14 \nThat's a point that I made in the business case because you have to like give your hypothesis right of what you're trying to accomplish. And, you know, in minor tangent, another one of our strategic pillars this year is all about modernizing our technology, which kinda makes me laugh. So technology.\nALEX\n25:34 \nBusiness bears.\nDAILA\n25:36 \nYeah. So anyway, so that's why, you know, I made the point in the business case to say, look, you know, we are modernizing our technology by getting an actual LMS but the point is that we're getting an LMS. It's not only gonna modernize what we do today, but it's going to impact what we do three to five years from now, you know, and what we're really to support our Growth, you know, as we continue to evolve and that type of thing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Daila proposes leveraging data from Docebo in Salesforce to inform account managers about actions they may take based on activity in the LMS.\n• Alex highlights a tool that can extract learning data from an LMS and pump it into a business intelligence tool without using multiple API calls.\n• Alex suggests custom workflows for Salesforce to identify people at risk and notify them when needed. \n• Daila mentions that technology modernization is one of the strategic pillars this year, pointing out how an LMS will not only modernize current operations but support future growth.

{"prompt":"DAILA\n26:02 \nSo, yeah, so that would be great and really looking at not necessarily having that information at the aggregate level but being able to drill down to, you know, the specific account level so that we can take actions. I think that would be great. Again, not expected right now. Like let's just get it.\nCustom Reports ends\nALEX\n26:28 \nYeah.\nDAILA\n26:29 \nYeah.\nALEX\n26:32 \nAs I'm hearing you talking like since there may be time and look like that's fine. Like I'm here to align on your time line, like what I like it like, you know, to sign it by March and Q1, of course, but like, you know, the reality is like I want just to be totally transparent throughout the whole process. And then, you know, let's just look, work through all the steps as they come, you know, but if we can, you know, save time like, you know, putting together a proposal or helping with the business case or doing this prom of it like whatever like I wanna do it.\nIntegrations\nALEX\n27:02 \nI'm thinking like it might… be worth your time actually like I've always said this even when before we were picked like we have a customer that I've actually met in person who has actually presented on Docebo and just presented at our S, Ko and she's literally like the same use cases, you external partner train customer training software, fast Growth software company, getting, you know, data from Docebo and Salesforce and like linking up those two systems and looking at customer health scores.\nIntegrations ends\nALEX\n27:35 \nAnd she's like a super user and she's just like can't speak enough awesome things. And I think you would just learn so much from her. Like I don't know if she's doing exactly what you're you know, like your, all these coaching programs and all these. But as far as just like insights on like how she like went through onboarding and like how she structured our Salesforce and just meeting, I think it would just be great to like put you to on or like, you know, set up a call with you. Yeah, her name's Patty and the company is site. I'll think of it in a second. But yeah, I just think like it would just be worth your time to look at that.\nDAILA\n28:19 \nYeah, no, that would be fantastic.\nALEX\n28:21 \nMS company. Yeah, our DMS, they are… interesting software tool. They basically… they work with like a law enforcement agencies. It's a software platform. Yeah, basically like to create efficiencies and managing kind of… you know, the, their staff and… like, yeah, public safety workforce, platinum platform. So, yeah. So they have to train customers all the time on their software. And so she has a lot of a lot of like stuff to say. She actually had to fight the case for, to get this LMS because they're powered by a place that already has an LMS. So she had to like present the business case. So she's presented, she like presented at a conference on presenting a business case of like when, yeah, when people say build your own LMS, you know, how did you get over that? And she presented actually at it was in Orlando. It wasn't an, at, it was a learning guild. She's pretty active. So, yeah, I think you need to go ahead of.\nDAILA\n29:48 \nIt'd be great. Yeah. And I, you know, would love to have Linda be a part of that as well. You know, I think, yeah, we'd love it.\nALEX\n29:55 \nOkay. So let me see if I can broker that. What's yeah, on top for next week? You think like?\nDAILA\n30:03 \nWell, like I said, I given the chatter that I've seen in through email, I feel like we should be expecting some msa red lines. I yesterday, I think is when I sent back the Pia form, so I probably won't hear back from them until later in the week.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Daila and Alex discussed the possibility of drilling down to the specific account level in order to take action.\n• Alex proposed aligning on a timeline for March/Q1 but wanted to be transparent throughout the process.\n• Alex suggested that Daila speak with Patty, a customer who has presented on Docebo, about her use cases, insights and customer health scores.\n• Daila also added that Linda should be involved in that call as well. \n• Daila is expecting redlines from the MSA this week.

And so, like I tried to get tickets last year, but there's like a lottery to get in the lottery to get tickets that are that hard to get. And somehow I got four this time. So like I grabbed him but it's 25 bucks a ticket, all you can eat and drink for the night and it's like it's amazing. So I'm excited.\nNICK\n2:17 \nYeah, that sounds awesome. You can't beat that with a stick, 25 bucks a pop. And that's like it's like when I see a concert, I, maybe when I go to like 15 dollar ticket, like what do I really have to lose? I always buy.\nKATIE\n2:27 \nA…\nNICK\n2:28 \nDay, maybe I'll take a friend. If I have to go by myself. I'm only got 15 bucks. So no big. No harm. No cool.\nKATIE\n2:34 \nBad.

So we're just really excited to talk to you today. I like to always level. So at the beginning of these calls really like to have a back and forth conversation, you know, keep it pretty casual. Obviously, it's Friday just kinda just learn more about what you all are looking to accomplish, how you kinda currently doing things. And then obviously, if you have any questions about our product, about us as an organization, feel free to ask me at any time. I'm more than happy to assist. Ideally. If at the end of the call, there's a one on the table for both parties, love to schedule some time and actually show you a demo of the product in action.

And then I got into HR about eight years ago. And so I've kinda stayed there and then this job came open at the zoo and what they were looking for was a mix of, but also a background on learning and development training and that kind of thing. So technically, the role is a Talent development person. So even though I'm in the HR department and doing that as well, a huge part of my job is Talent development and the, and it's an added role at the zoo.

{"prompt":"KATIE\n5:01 \nSo, so I was lucky enough to have that, you know, what they were looking for and I love here is the best place in the whole world. I've already, I've been here like two weeks now and I'm already like can I get here earlier? But anyway, so that said, so the zoo has trait, there are people here that have taught things, they facilitated things.\nSmall Talk ends\nKATIE\n5:28 \nThere's all kinds of training going on. Not just, you know, like about taking care of animals that a lot of like diversity initiatives. So really what we're looking for at this point. And what I'm here for is not just to adopt an LMS load, it manage or, you know, manage the training, but also organize this project.\nLearning Plans\nKATIE\n5:54 \nSo once we get an LMS, being able to work with the people here at the zoo that have courses, help them load, the courses, facilitate the courses. And in of them teach them to teach a course using the LMS. So it wouldn't be necessarily all online learning. It's gonna be a blended modality.\nLearning Plans ends\nKATIE\n6:17 \nSo, I mean we're looking at all kinds of things and from a previous experience implementing canvas at say Christian university which I love and I know it's more of an academic thing. The zoo has a good balance of we're learning institution. I mean, we're world famous for lots of different things. So we wanna be able to share that knowledge about conservation, animal welfare, you know, around the world, not just internally. So I mean we're really looking for a platform that's going to be able to meet all those needs for us… and do it in a way that works well, plays well with others and isn't gonna, you know, present a lot of roadblocks for us.\nNICK\n7:04 \nGotcha. No, I appreciate that. That's it gives me some good talking points. I'm always formulating questions in my head. I would love to talk about your vision on how you want to organize the project. That's something I really stood out to me about not only when it comes to you managing the LMS and, you know, making sure people are getting the right information at the right time, whether that can be, I would assume that's coming to onboarding and things like that. But also you talked about the external Audience of people sharing this information around the world and helping just be a greener planning and people saving the environment and things like that. I'm all about that as well. So I'm glad we're aligned but also you mentioned helping people actually develop their own skill set in terms of you may be teaching their expertise and being better presenters in that regard, kind of what is your vision when it comes to that? In terms of, hey, how I want to say, hey, you work in this department, I wanna make sure that you can manage this Instructor led session, kinda, how do you envision that? Kinda going on with the intent with your next LMS?\nKATIE\n8:04 \nSo kind of right now, we're working on some learning tracks and curriculum trying to help the department which and like I said, I'm still very new at this but we, you know, I wanted to go ahead and start the adoption process for an LMS as soon as we could so that at least we have something in place as we were working through this process. So… so what we wanna do is be able to take like, you know, let's say we've got a learning path for, you know, let's say by the bird group, you know, and we're going to have a bunch of specialists put together courses in that anywhere from you know, getting the animals here to taking care of them to dealing with geriatric animals, things like that. But we also want to offer internally maybe somebody wants to, maybe somebody wants to take a course about delivering online learning or blended or whatever. So, the one thing that we do wanna make sure of the entire time is that we have a standard based consistent model for this training. So it's not gonna be something where somebody's like, hey, I wanna keep the course. And then I just open up a shell for them and they start it's. Not gonna be anything like that. It's one of those deals where we want them to have. So we want them to learn how to use an LMS. But also at the same time in order to make sure that we've got some quality control we'll have, we may have like peer review, we may do rubric based, but there will be a set of standards before anything can be delivered, you know, to the public or coworkers or whoever it might be. They'll have to follow those standards before anything will be, you know, able to be delivered.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • She is looking for a Learning Management System (LMS) to manage training, organize a project and facilitate courses. \n• Katie wants to create learning tracks and curriculum for different departments, from getting animals there to taking care of them, as well as encouraging staff development in terms of technology delivery and presentation skills. \n• She would like to set standards for quality control with peer review and rubric-based assessment before anything can be delivered to the public.

{"prompt":"NICK\n9:54 \nGotcha. Yeah, I know. And you know, that actually I like your ideas there because Docebo actually has, I mean, obviously, I'm not sure I'll canvas as had their set up but Docebo, you have your end user, which is called a learner, and then you have your admin. We actually have a middle tier, call it a Power user. They can be like have a subset of admin functionality. They can, you know, maybe upload, you can give them some ability to maybe upload some content but it can be reviewed by the admin and things like that. So we have that capability within our platform to really do what you were trying to do there and how you explained it.\nCoach & Share\nNICK\n10:26 \nSo yeah, if you want to do P, review as well as a new hire, they come in but they still have a lot of expertise in a certain field. They can upload some information and then a Power user can say, hey, this is great information I can share with xyz Audience.\nCoach & Share ends\nNICK\n10:39 \nSo really put the owners on some of those subject matter experts around the organization to really help grow that. So, yeah, I'm totally aligned the.\nKATIE\n10:47 \nThat is another like what you're talking about that's another project. And actually he works in the office with me and handle like our onboarding making sure new hires are, you know, seated well, ready to go with the position. So I just actually talked to him earlier today about putting together an onboarding course and using this as an onboarding tool where, you know, I not that people can just start here and never come to the HR office or meet us in person, but, you know, have a way to, you know, even if it's the first 90 days it might be, but we could use this for so many different things. So, so it's kinda one of those things where we're just trying to look into things. And I'm not super familiar with Docebo. I know a little bit about it just from like the past that I've heard about it… but yeah, it would be helpful to get an idea like your pricing structure, your, you know, the housing, how you house, the courses, the availability, what all that stuff is like, which I'm sure we're going to go over, but those are just some of the questions that I have because we're still in, you know, pretty early stages.\nLayout & Content\nNICK\n11:56 \nYeah, of course. Yeah. I'm just taking some notes here on my other screen just doing, we can definitely talk about our pricing structure and how, I mean, when it comes to like designing courses that's something, I can definitely show you a demonstration but it's very simple. I mean, when it comes to uploading content, I mean, and then actually like setting that up into a pathway and then giving it to the right right time, it's no more than clicks of button.\nLayout & Content ends\nNICK\n12:21 \nSo it's nothing super complicated to where you have to go jump through a lot of hoops to really get this to the right people. And that's the best I can tell you now, but yeah, I can definitely, we can definitely highlight that. I can show you what that process looks like, 100 percent and I can cover the pricing to on the back half of the call. I can talk about and I can talk about our structure and things like that. No problem.\nKATIE\n12:44 \nOkay.\nNICK\n12:46 \nSorry.\nKATIE\n12:47 \nBefore I forget, I just wanna make sure that a big thing too is accessibility features which I'm sure you guys have that in some fashion that I would just like to see those or learn more about those also. Were you scorm or API compliant or? Okay, great. So that's a big thing that I'm actually noticing some of the more corporate LMS are not scorm or API. I don't know why or what exactly what it would take to do that, but it's good to know that Docebo has that. So those are really the things that I'm gonna let you go. Now, let you.\nNICK\n13:19 \nNo, no, please, no, that's totally fine. Please ask. And yeah, like when it comes to scoring packages or X API, and whatever you wanna call them, we can satisfy those within the system. So if you're using any type of offering, you have those type of more robust pieces of content. You can upload those and it can be presented to your learners. No problem at all. And then you mentioned accessibility when it comes to accessibility, we are, I don't remember the exact like WC ag compliance?\nKATIE\n13:45 \nOkay, perfect.\nNICK\n13:46 \nSo I can send you some information on that, but we are compliant. We have that accessibility standard.\nWrap-Up\nKATIE\n13:52 \nOkay, perfect.\nNICK\n13:53 \nThat…\nKATIE\n13:53 \nWas the main thing I was looking for? So you're good.\nNICK\n13:55 \nPerfect. Perfect. Yeah, I would love to hear from you. I know you talked about your colleague, Aaron. He handles the onboarding and I know you just went through the onboarding. I love to hear the process.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n14:05 \nHey, how was it for you? What is when you got hired? What did the onboarding structure look like for you from day one to finish? I kinda walk me through that.\nKATIE\n14:16 \nWell, we actually, this would be a new project. So right now onboarding involved. So Aaron would talk to the department or the team lead or the director.\nSmall Talk\nKATIE\n14:28 \nThey would say, hey, we want to hire Katie hill here's. Her start date, email address, all that stuff. So Aaron would go into that in our HRIS which is pay core. I don't know if you've heard of that one or not. It's kind of a it's growing but it was started out small locally and they bought a football stadium and waste a lot of money.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Katie talked to her colleague Aaron about an onboarding course and using Docebo as an onboarding tool.\n• Aaron's onboarding process involved talking with the department/team lead/director about the new hire details, such as their start date and email address. They use PayCore HRIS for this. END"}
{"prompt":"KATIE\n14:46 \nAnd so, you know, what it does feel. So we're not like super thrilled with it but it is what it is. But so basically our onboarding right now, it's different pending on which department you're working in because like my onboarding, you know, involved meeting with Aaron. We have a course called zoo way, which is where or well it's not a course. But basically Aaron meets with the new hires, goes over just how this work, security, things that you that are, must know for your first few days on the job. And then, you know, you can, we take tours at the zoo. We meet different departments that's been my experience which has been great. But I'm not sure. And I'm sure Aaron could speak more to that as to, you know, what he would like to do with other departments on people. We have a lot of seasonal people that we're getting ready to bring on board. And we even have a lot of volunteers that, you know, this may necessarily, this might actually be a good fit for them in certain, for certain things.\nSmall Talk\nKATIE\n15:54 \nBut the seasonal help… that, you know, starts when the spring and summer happens, that's a huge wave, you know, that will keep Aaron super busy. So this will be a way maybe, you know, by next year, we have this in place for the seasonal kind of wave of people coming in that will help them kinda get them on boarded in a more efficient way or faster and, you know, he doesn't have to feel overwhelmed or whatever. So.\nSmall Talk ends\nNICK\n16:21 \nYeah, most definitely. And I just like to ask that question too. I mean, throughout our first 18 minutes of our conversation, I've already seen you have a lot of ideas of how you would like to utilize an LMS. And I always through these evaluations, I really wanted to be a partnership between me, you and Aaron.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n16:36 \nWe're all putting our heads together. So if identify gaps and how can we best maximize the use of the product to help make it streamlined for you guys? So just something like that, that's plenty of information… of your onboarding experience. I appreciate that. One of the other things I wanted to touch on was the content.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n16:52 \nI know you talked about you probably obviously you're gonna have some proprietary content that's specific for the zoos, but I would imagine there's compliance regulations that you have when it comes to the Zoom you talked about if someone wants to learn about, you know, how do we get better at public speaking? And then how, where is that content being pulled from? Moving forward? What is your content strategy? Is it all being built in house? You're pulling it from an extra provider? Is it a hybrid approach? Kind of? What is your content strategy?\nKATIE\n17:22 \nRight now, and again, this is we're still at the very beginning of the Talent development piece, but it's we've got a lot of people especially in our animal department.\nIntegrations ends\nKATIE\n17:33 \nThey have a ton of content there. So, and a lot of it comes from those guys and gals over there have taught a lot of courses, done a lot of white or the white paper presentations to post their presentation. So a lot of the content, the bulk of it is gonna be from our people in house.\nIntegrations\nKATIE\n17:53 \nWe're not necessarily looking to bring things in other than, I mean maybe like a sexual resent course or slips and falls or something like that, you know, has that would have to be done in order to keep our accreditation and things like that. But nobody really has the time or the bandwidth to build but just be able to, you know, bring that course cartridge in loaded and deliver it.\nIntegrations ends\nKATIE\n18:21 \nSo, I mean there we really since this is kind of a wide open thing. We're just kinda looking for what's gonna be most effective efficient, you know, and make this piece work for everybody.\nNICK\n18:32 \nYeah, most definitely. And I think that's right when you're doing something that is, you know, a field like biology and you're talking about like I'm not using the right terminology, but I used to watch like planet earth back in college.\nCoach & Share\nNICK\n18:46 \nI'm obsessed with the type of thing, but I was not a scientist but I like to watch it. But when you have those type of more technical type fields that like you wanna utilize those subject matter experts in house that have that content. I know you said they're like they've taught course, they've taught classes, they've done presentations.\nCoach & Share ends\nNICK\n19:04 \nBut when it comes to actually putting those in the LMS, I know they're probably going to still have some like ILT type sessions, but the mentioned scoring packages X API is going to be videos PDF.\nKATIE\n19:17 \nWhat type?\nNICK\n19:17 \nOf content types you're gonna be looking to bring in?\nKATIE\n19:20 \nIt looks like I'm just looking at some of the case. We've got a big like list of these. It looks like most of the people. And like I said, again, this is, I'm still kinda in the beginning of like listening sessions and needs assessments with the department. It looks like some of the courses will pull from like the ADA which is the American or the association for zoological something. And then a lot of those though are going to be built out by the people themselves and a lot of them, you know, the, I think the plan is they're gonna use a lot of the stuff that they've already developed for those, you know, those lectures that they've presented and courses that they've taught in other places. But yeah, we don't have anything that I'm aware of at the moment that needs to be imported. Like I think we truly are starting from scratch in a lot of ways. So, so the implementation part would not be really that bad because like I said, I'm almost certain that we don't have like a library of courses to load. So.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Aaron meets with new hires to explain their roles and security protocols, while tours of the Zoo and meetings with other departments help orient them.\n• In preparation for the wave of seasonal hires, implementing an LMS would help streamline onboarding processes.\n• Content will be largely built in-house from existing courses and lectures by animal department experts, with potential for external course cartridges for specific accreditation requirements. END"}
{"prompt":"NICK\n20:36 \nYeah, no, that's totally fine. I know you and I know you said you, you're still learning a line? Listen, there's questions if that, I'm gonna ask if you don't have the answers for me that's something like don't worry at all?\nKATIE\n20:49 \nRight.\nNICK\n20:49 \nRight.\nKATIE\n20:50 \nI would say, yeah, that's one we're still learning and trying to figure out.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n20:54 \nFor sure. And yeah, when it comes to content, it's something I always think is key to a strategy for it sounds like you'll have some idea of with what you're trying to accomplish. But, you know, you talked about, you know, some Professional development compliance type things. We do have a content library if you're just needing a couple of courses. I personally want to recommend content library because the base courses, but we do have a library of courses that you can pull from that are premade for that type of development type, content compliance and technical skills, you know, how to time management, things like that and we can walkthrough that.\nIntegrations ends\nNICK\n21:29 \nIn general. I did want to mention is we have a product called Shape and you talk about creating, do Shape is basically like what I like, I call it a light content creation tool. So when you have a lot of lying around maybe slide presentation, you find an article from the internet, you can actually upload that into Shape. And within 10 gonna utilize the artificial intelligence to actually extract the most relevant information and create what we like to call a micro learning pill. And then you can actually upload that within. So if you don't want to have to… you know, if, you know, when it comes to, you know, creating scoring packages that takes weeks and weeks to do and then sometimes.\nKATIE\n22:09 \nYeah.\nNICK\n22:10 \nYou don't wanna have, you know, just okay, you have your ILT sessions but you don't want to just say, hey here's a PDF read that if you want to have something more engaging for your learners, that's an option, we can and I can send you a, one of our solution engineers actually walkthrough our Shape product and I can send you some information.\nIntegrations\nNICK\n22:25 \nWe find it interesting. We can set up some time and talk discuss that more. But something I like to mention was when I heard you don't have a whole lot of courses and content right now that's something that can help you upload or create content quickly and help you grow your content library. So something that always like to mention.\nIntegrations ends\nKATIE\n22:42 \nI would definitely love to see that because that sounds fantastic.\nNICK\n22:51 \nAnd I think it's good to when you talk about leveraging those departments, the people that are in those departments that have those equities, leveraging those SMS. I mean, I think it's great for them to utilize that type of that type of product as well. So you…\nPricing\nKATIE\n23:03 \nRight. I can…\nNICK\n23:04 \nDefinitely send you some more information about that.\nKATIE\n23:07 \nGreat. I'd love to see that.\nNICK\n23:09 \nAbout five minutes left. I didn't want to briefly talk about our pricing structure. So the structure on what's called a… monthly active user pricing model. What that means is you can have you buy, we'll use our, I mean, I can't remember what you said or you have about 200 or 250 people accessing the platform. Is that accurate?\nKATIE\n23:33 \nProbably…\nNICK\n23:34 \nOkay. All right. So our monthly active user pricing model, we'll use our base plan of 300 monthly active users. That's our base model that's the lowest we go. So for 300 monthly active user pricing model, what that means is in any given month, you can have up to 300 people go into the platform and take training. So you can have unlimited registered. We're just tracking who's actually going into the system and taking training. So let's say one was in, they browse around the platform. They look at their user profile that's not going to be considered an active user. It's only the people that are gonna actually start taking a training session. Then we'll count them as an active user. So for example… you buy our platform, you can have 300 people come in February or when February ends in March.\nKATIE\n24:20 \nRolls around and…\nNICK\n24:21 \nSet back to zero, and then the next month, you can have the same users come in different users mix and match and you have…\nKATIE\n24:29 \nYou have accounts.\nNICK\n24:31 \nWithin the admin side, that will tell you like, you know, how close you're getting to your number, but that's kinda how I think it's a good model because it allows for a lot of flexibility when it comes to, you know, who's accessing the system on a monthly basis. So basically, you pay that annual fee, but we're just tracking the monthly basis?\nKATIE\n24:49 \nNo, I think and they plan 300. So I mean, that sounds pretty kinda in a spot where we might be with the including seasonal employees we may be getting up for, and do we have 300 people when they're seasonal? I tell you, so we're over 300, when we have a full staff of seasonal as well. So that actually would work out great.\nNICK\n25:12 \nAnd I know Aaron probably answered your question. He's over 300, how high over 300, just wondering.\nKATIE\n25:20 \nHi, would we go, Aaron over like what's the max number? That in your mind, we would be fully staffed with seasonal and everybody else. Okay? So Aaron says if he's wrong, that he will give us 100 dollars a piece, but he said they'll hold him to it. He said that he would get a feeling of about 500.\nNICK\n25:50 \nOkay. So we have that's our next plan. So we have a 300 user plan and a 500 user plan. It depends.\nKATIE\n25:56 \nSo we…\nNICK\n25:57 \nCan explore the pricing, but it's gonna depend on how high you're gonna go because we do charge an overage fee. So let's say you went with 300, you had 301 people come into the system. We charge an overage additional person. What I usually recommend is you say, hey, if you're having, you know, 10 people go over 20, go with the overage fee. Now, if you're thinking you're gonna have five months and have 500 and always going with the higher tier. And then we can look at say you're having five months at 507 at 300, maybe we can just discount the 500 plan a little bit to make it like in between for you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Nick and Katie discussed the possibility of leveraging departments with existing equity to create content quickly.\n• Nick suggested Shape.\n• Katie expressed interest in seeing Shape.\n END"}
{"prompt":"NICK\n26:32 \nSo there's some ways we can explore the pricing, but we can put our heads together and kinda dive into that for sure.\nKATIE\n26:37 \nOkay, perfect.\nNICK\n26:38 \nBut I hope that was pretty. I wanted to be, I wanted to be transparent with the pricing. Any other questions you had about the pricing, the structure or the, anything like that?\nPricing\nKATIE\n26:46 \nSo, what is like for the 300 base plan? So your monthly active user pricing model. So what is that cost approximately or three? If we went with the 300?\nNICK\n26:57 \nYeah. So for the base LMS, just the LMS, and then we have an eight week onboarding plan that's only applicable for 305 100. So for, and I'm just doing the math in my head right now plan, it's going to be about 20… 5,800 dollars for the first year. And then you 1,300 for the next year. So the price of the price of the LMS for 300 is 20,330 for a three investment through three, your investment. And then for the first year, only you pay the onboarding charge of 5,500.\nKATIE\n27:36 \nOkay.\nNICK\n27:37 \nSo…\nKATIE\n27:37 \nThat makes sense.\nNICK\n27:38 \nAnd…\nKATIE\n27:39 \nPretty.\nNICK\n27:41 \nYeah. And then for the 500 user plan, it's gonna be the same price for onboarding for the first year only, but the cost of the plan is going to be 28,890.\nKATIE\n27:54 \nOkay. Yeah, that's not bad. Okay. That helps.\nPricing ends\nNICK\n27:59 \nThat's the two plans I would recommend. So that's the kind of the nation there between those two. Okay? I've been through, so.\nKATIE\n28:06 \nI…\nNICK\n28:07 \nNeed these pricing calls and I just, I was like digging and I was like, I knew that I knew.\nKATIE\n28:13 \nYeah, I would say like it's probably pretty easy to come up with after this mining. So, when can we meet again? And when I wanna like look at the platform also, I'm very interested in the Shape product. I don't know if you can put those two into one meeting or if that's possible or?\nNICK\n28:33 \nYeah, we can highlight the Shape on the demo. I mean, we always have a Shape video in one of our learning courses that we can highlight.\nPricing\nNICK\n28:41 \nAnd just for the Shape, it's gonna be… for the 300 user plan will be 7,500 just to let you know that. I think for a 500, I don't know it off the top of my head, I'll be honest with you. I wanna say it's like actually just let me pull it up really quick and I can just tell you for 500, it's gonna be 8,500.\nNext Steps\nKATIE\n29:06 \nOkay. Gotcha.\nNICK\n29:07 \nSo, just so you have those to, well, yeah, we can definitely highlight that. I have my calendar pulled up and I'm looking next week for.\nKATIE\n29:14 \nIt's looking.\nNICK\n29:15 \nLike Wednesday or Thursday or my best days?\nKATIE\n29:23 \nOkay. Well.\nNICK\n29:26 \nI…\nKATIE\n29:26 \nToday is a good day for me. I'm wide open.\nNICK\n29:29 \nPerfect. Yeah, I'm on Eastern Time. So… anytime after 10 30 10 30 eastern on Thursday, I'm fine. So whatever works for you?\nKATIE\n29:40 \nWhy don't we try again for two o'clock if that's okay. That works well.\nNICK\n29:46 \nAnd I just forgot, I need to bring in two. Yep, that works perfectly. Okay. I'll be bringing in my solutions consultant, lowes show how we run the demonstration. So I'll just make a note two PM, Thursday. I'll send you the invite call and I just had one more just if you don't have mine just a couple more quick questions. Unless you need to hop off.\nNext Steps ends\nKATIE\n30:10 \nYeah, you're fine.\nNICK\n30:11 \nI just wanted regarding the, you said no in timelines, you said no firm deadlines right now. Ideally, when would you like to get something like choose a vendor or get something implemented in place?\nKATIE\n30:25 \nI know that we've got a grant that we're working with in the animal department and the deadline for the grant of September. So by actually before September, we need to have at least four to six courses even if they're not being taught yet, they need to be like in the process of building or we have to show progress for this grant by September. And then, so I mean, this, we're not really super tight on the time. I mean, like we're not running into like where we've got to choose something quickly. But my guess is we would try to decide something by the end of March at the late.\nNICK\n31:06 \nGotcha. Gotcha. Perfect. And then just the last question, I'm assuming you'll probably bring Aaron in on some of these conversations.\nOnboarding\nNICK\n31:13 \nMaybe in the future. I'm not sure, but anyone else that you're gonna want to bring in? I always like to just get my team aware if we're going to need to pull in any it resources or things like anyone else that's really going to be bringing into the conversations that are gonna wanna help you evaluate the product or make the decision, choose the vendor.\nNext Steps\nKATIE\n31:32 \nYeah, yeah. I'll let you know. I'll ask my HR director. He actually had to step out for a few minutes, but I'll see if he wants to be on the call next week and I'll see if Aaron wants to look at it as well. I'm sure he would be interested in what the platform looks like.\nWrap-Up\nNICK\n31:49 \nPerfect. That sounds great. Katie. Well, I appreciate you being a good start answering some of those questions for me. It's just the first questions my sales manager are gonna ask. They wanna know about time line and all that Jazz. And, you know?\nKATIE\n32:01 \nI appreciate that completely.\nNICK\n32:03 \nWell, just to satisfy them, but no, I really appreciate it. Like I said, I'll send you over some information about Shape tool, and then I'll send you the invite between now and next week. If you do have any questions for me, don't hesitate to reach out more than happy to assist, but it was lovely meeting you today and I hope you have a great weekend, okay?\nKATIE\n32:20 \nYeah, you as well.

I'd put it into my asset creation in Docebo. And that's how it would become something that is presented then to learners.

And Docebo is gonna capture that and create the asset based on the users actions.\nCoach & Share ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n2:56 \nSo to quickly go back and for had in terms of like actually creating things in Docebo just based on engagement within YouTube. Does that sound familiar to you at all?\nFERHAT\n3:10 \nNot, I know we can, once we have you have the link, we are grabbing the meta data of the video or the file that you're trying to bring, but.\nCoach & Share\nJODIE\n3:22 \nBut I suppose to be like an admin that does that piece of it.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n3:27 \nNot necessarily. So like as an admin, you can add a YouTube video in a course in a formal learning plan, like anything in a formal capacity for sure. But I showed them that last call that if any of your learners or Power users really anybody you want to give access to this ability, they can share the YouTube files themselves and it'll embed it in Docebo, whether it's on a landing page, whether it's in a course, or whether it's an informal asset. So if you recall that little workflow I showed where we shared a link, I had.\nJODIE\n3:52 \nYeah.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n3:53 \nOther video and then you could post it internally or share it with colleagues. So although like we don't like again, we encourage people to be in the learning system, right? Cause that's where we can capture the data. So obviously we can go watch you to. But if people find the content valuable, you want to add it to the validated content library, then this is the process they would go through. Just throw in the link, add it to the channel or send it to whoever they want. And that's it.\nCertifications\nJODIE\n4:15 \nRight. It's still though manual steps. I think I was helping to kind of go with Gloria point of it's not like there's no intelligence happening. It says someone's going to look at this must be important. Let's bring it in and let's not necessarily make a public for let's track it against that person's, transcript that they were interested in underwater basket weaving, and they took on, they watched the tube on underwater basket weaving. And now it's showing up on their transcript as that's an area that they want to explore more.\nMobile App\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n4:43 \nUnderstood. So it actually cookies the individuals computer. Yeah. Okay. For had any recollection of anything like that?\nFERHAT\n4:51 \nI don't have anything that I can think of top of my head, but we can investigate and see if there's anything.\nJODIE\n4:56 \nI know, kinda creepy too, right? Someone's watching me to see what I watch.\nSmall Talk\nTRACI\n5:00 \nI don't want them to know what I'm watching outside of work. Not that it's crazy, but, you know, it's not relevant to.\nJODIE\n5:07 \nMy job. All right.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n5:09 \nYeah. I was using more computer to watch video. Sometimes I was watching trinobile last night.\nTRACI\n5:15 \nYeah, I do it seldom but, you know?\nSmall Talk ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n5:20 \nNo, no, for sure. With all that being said. Yeah, like we don't have that specific example. News did do some homework though based on that, we actually have integrated with Ed cast in the past. Now, I know that I think they're owned by a different.\nJODIE\n5:33 \nThey're now on by Cornerstone. So I'm sure that integration is now dead.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n5:36 \nProbably, I would assume if, like if knowing what people are doing outside of the platform… and you want to know what they're doing in that capacity, like, yeah, that's something that he was not gonna do as alert like personal experience. And if I had to guess like I can't speak on the half of another platform, I'd be a little bit worried if I was an employee that an employer was tracking everything I do with my work computer, right? Because for some people, this is their only computer. So, I…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Christian described the workflow for adding YouTube videos to formal learning plans, channels or sending them to colleagues for informal learning. \n• Jodie pointed out that this process is still manual and discussed the possibility of tracking individual activities on a computer, which Christian thought might be worrying for employees.

{"prompt":"JODIE\n6:04 \nI don't know.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n6:05 \nHow deep it goes? But if I'm going to access bank statements and that kinda, I'm sure it's an entirely different world, but I'd be curious about that kind of stuff.\nJODIE\n6:11 \nYeah, I don't know. I wasn't I can't get 100 percent clarity and it's probably by design, right?\nMobile App\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n6:17 \nYeah.\nJODIE\n6:18 \nThat they don't have a tech white paper publicly available on. It looks like a combination of browser capturing and screen scraping.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n6:26 \nScreen scraping. So that's yeah. Okay. That's where I would be concerned, understood.\nJODIE\n6:31 \nIn there, Christian, sorry onto this meeting and what we're supposed to be.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n6:34 \nYes, yes. 100 percent. Okay. Wonderful. So I…\nIntegrations\nJODIE\n6:38 \nLooks like we don't…\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n6:38 \nHave Earl. So in that case, then I'm gonna leave it to Ferhat to ask the team a couple of questions. And what we're gonna do is we're just gonna fully understand what you want out of the Salesforce integration. We've had chats in the past, but now that we have Ferhat and Christian on the call as well. Stephanie, I, it's best to kind of start this conversation. It doesn't have to be Google super in depth from scratch. Then Ferhat can present the integration how it works. And then we can send the recording to your team to forward over to Earl after the fact. So, Ferhat, if you wouldn't mind taking it away.\nFERHAT\n7:07 \nAll right. Sounds good. The couple of questions comes into my mind is what kind of integration you're looking with Salesforce? What's the use case in there? I know you have adp now, Salesforce on the table, what kind of information you're trying to bring to do Chiba and make use of it?\nPayment Gateway\nTRACI\n7:23 \nSure. I can tell you that we capture our customer information and they purchase software for us, calling all access pass and we take that license capability for the people who are in that company and they get passed over to the information. So we'd want to be able to log into, you know, the all of learning opportunities because I have that pass.\nIntegrations\nJODIE\n7:48 \nHey… Earl is our expert in it on all integrations and keeps us out of trouble.\nEARL\n8:00 \nYeah. Nice to meet you. Yeah, primarily with things like Salesforce integration and other, just various systems in our ecosystem. So, pleasure to meet you. And I will just list.\nFERHAT\n8:11 \nMan.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n8:12 \nLike guys, Earl, good to meet you as well to the team here.\nIntegrations ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n8:14 \nChristian, Ferhat and Stephanie are all on the Docebo side. I've been the main point of contact this far just to confirm Earl. Do you have a hard stop in 20 minutes… for, I understood in the emails?\nEARL\n8:26 \nYes, I apologize. I didn't get a reminder for the meeting. Sorry, or I didn't see it. So I apologize. I'm late.\nIntegrations\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n8:34 \nNo worries at all. We'll just get to it. We're discussing the Salesforce integration for us asking a few questions, then we'll present the integration.\nEARL\n8:41 \nPerfect.\nTRACI\n8:43 \nAnd I just mentioned that what we're pulling right now is our customers who purchased the software. The all access pass are the ones who have the unlimited access to the training.\nPayment Gateway\nTRACI\n8:52 \nAnd that's kinda the where we're talking about the integration point plus people who are customers of ours who have connections log INS would be able to access training whether they paid for it or whether it was part of the past.\nFERHAT\n9:07 \nOkay. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you for explaining that. And in terms of that customer journey, then they basically become… they would have access to all the course content that is, that are supposed to be available to them. Is that accurate?\nTRACI\n9:22 \nIf they have a pass, if they purchase the software pass, yes, other people can access it and they pay a one off fee for the classes as they access those classes.\nIntegrations\nFERHAT\n9:32 \nOkay. And all that payments and all that free work that they need to get access to happens with Salesforce, right?\nTRACI\n9:42 \nYes.\nFERHAT\n9:42 \nOkay. All right. So one of the options I can talk is we also have a managed app for Salesforce where you can install a Docebo app to the Salesforce itself. And what it does is it has its own scope that it works. So, what can happen in your case is, if once a customer or customer page to have an access to certain courses, they can be created from Salesforce users, contacts custom objects in Docebo. So you can basically map what fields from Salesforce that needs to feed into Docebo using that app and based on their purchase, you can add those details or levels of access to their additional fields and that can drive their group membership, and which courses or catalogs they have access in to.\nIntegrations ends\nTRACI\n10:38 \nIs that what's already included Christian in our, in the proposal that we have? Great. Okay.\nFERHAT\n10:45 \nAnd I can show you a diagram question. I know if you don't mind sharing that diagram where that or do you want me to grab it? If you don't have it available, I don't think I can hear you but.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n10:57 \nYeah, thank you. Thank you. I think your presentation at a bit more detail in Salesforce. So I suggest using your slides just in case you need to flip to any other images?\nFERHAT\n11:06 \nAwesome. Let me quickly do.\nEARL\n11:11 \nAnd I assume that this app that you're… talking about can be used by a digital experience community site.\nIntegrations\nFERHAT\n11:22 \nYes, you can. It has a functionality that allows you to embed it in your communities as well. So, the cio experience comes an embedded in your Salesforce as well. Okay. Here's the data diagram. What kind of information is passed between the cio and Salesforce? As I mentioned, I was talking about, you can configure that will be admin interface where you can configure these data sharing steps.\nBranches & Groups\nFERHAT\n11:50 \nSo you can pull data from users, contact custom objects to do those or information in our environment. And then basically, it sets a schedule process so you can set it up as one hour frequently at the most scheduled, you can set it up. And then the other part is if you want to bring their account information, that can map them to Branches, that could be something you can also utilize in order to allow them to have access to certain areas or certain experience using branch structure in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jodie and Christian discussed the integration of Salesforce.\n• Traci explained that customers who purchase an All Access Pass have unlimited access to their learning opportunities.\n• Earl confirmed that he was their primary contact for integrations.\n• Ferhat discussed the use of a managed app for Salesforce that allows users to map fields from Salesforce into Docebo, including group membership and access to courses or catalogs. \n• He also explained how they can embed it in communities with Digital Experience and set up data sharing steps with a one-hour schedule process. \n• He showed a diagram outlining what kind of information is passed between the CIO and Salesforce. END"}
{"prompt":"EARL\n12:27 \nOkay. That's great. So, Tracey, are we looking at maybe establishing Branches for different product lines?\nTRACI\n12:34 \nProbably not product lines. I think… the bigger thing would be, do they have the past and do I need to charge them for the class or not? That would be the, that would be the account level information I'll be looking at.\nPayment Gateway\nTRACI\n12:46 \nAlthough that is a possibility that we would say, I only expose to you enterprise training. If you have an enterprise license, we probably would not want to do that. We probably want people to have opportunities like for migrations to have access to other training classes. So that may not be something that we would do in that.\nEARL\n13:04 \nI wanna put a bug in your ear then. I know that some of our business units are interested in providing like help yourself type things right for their customer communities. And so that seems like something we get to leverage this branch concept around.\nTRACI\n13:26 \nThat's true, that's true in the non purchased kind of training thing that we're talking about. Yes. Yes.\nEARL\n13:32 \nSo, we don't need to go any further down that, but it looks like there's a great opportunity to provide us some product tailored content using a branch concept and use.\nTRACI\n13:42 \nOkay. Yeah.\nEARL\n13:43 \nBut the accounts have access to control what the users have access to for their products, which is a big.\nIntegrations\nTRACI\n13:51 \nGreat. That's perfect.\nFERHAT\n13:55 \nAwesome.\nSTEPHANIE\n13:56 \nThat…\nFERHAT\n13:56 \nIs how we can bring information about the user and what they have access to Docebo. And then Docebo can drive their experience with your configuration based on groups or Branches in Docebo and the other side of the things from Docebo to Salesforce. This, you can bring courses, learning plans, sessions and their enrollments back to custom objects to the Salesforce.\nCustom Reports\nFERHAT\n14:19 \nSo, what this allows in Salesforce, you will have completion records, their progress status, and their enrollments to courses in Salesforce. And you can build your business KPI'S dashboards using those records that are they're completing their courses or they're progressing to the content they have access to from Ohio?\nCustom Reports ends\nTRACI\n14:38 \nAnd that's great. All one of the things we've talked about but have done nothing with. Is this idea of a concept of certification? Perhaps you can become certified in things in PDI? And maybe that gives you higher priority. You go to a level two tier support instead of having to go in level one or, you know, it would give you some options to do some things that might be extremely beneficial for some of those customers that they would be willing to pay for that. So.\nCourse Enrollment\nEARL\n15:04 \nSo, I know that we have custom objects in Salesforce, resent our classes.\nTRACI\n15:10 \nRight.\nEARL\n15:10 \nOur sessions. And so we would need to, you would want to associate courses in the, with the classes and Salesforce, or have some way to link them so that we can get a completion event coming back and associate with the appropriate class in the university construct.\nIntegrations\nTRACI\n15:34 \nRight.\nEARL\n15:34 \nRight.\nTRACI\n15:35 \nYeah. Right now, I don't have a ton tied to saying, I don't have anything in Salesforce. It says this user took these classes and Docebo will hold that information for us, right? That information I could get out of the LMS and not have to have that in Salesforce.\nCertifications\nTRACI\n15:52 \nOkay. The only thing that I might want to bring back is like I said, a completion of a certification record could come back over. We would probably no longer manage all of the courses and classes in Salesforce once.\nEARL\n16:04 \nOkay. Got it. Great. So we would just take that out.\nTRACI\n16:09 \nRight.\nEARL\n16:11 \nWe would use their plugin to show them the courses that are relevant that could enroll for them there through that mechanism. We would track or completion and all that stuff in that mechanism, but you might take some information from the user into based on completions and update something on their contact or some related, something related to their contact to show they completed a learning plan.\nLearning Plans\nTRACI\n16:37 \nExactly, right?\nEARL\n16:38 \nGot it. That makes sense.\nTRACI\n16:40 \nOkay.\nFERHAT\n16:41 \nAwesome. Just to show you data model of what will happen in Salesforce when you establish it, you will have nine custom objects. And here are the custom objects that you will see basically their learning plans, learning plan, courses, their sessions, session, attendance, their enrollments with their status and completion in progress, and their learning plan, course enrollments, and then the learning plan enrollment as well.\nIntegrations\nFERHAT\n17:05 \nSo you will be able to figure out which courses they're taking, what's their progress and what's their attendance in session, if there's a session existing.\nEARL\n17:16 \nSo, all of these are in Salesforce?\nFERHAT\n17:18 \nThese are all will be created in Salesforce.\nEARL\n17:22 \nI might have a connections user, a customer user in our connections community that's gonna be a contact is actually going to be a user as well, but it's a community user that's associated with a contact record.\nIntegrations ends\nEARL\n17:35 \nSo I would want to associate that the co user, we can get there. We can get there. Yeah, I'll see how it works. So that's good.\nTRACI\n17:44 \nOkay. Do you feel comfortable with this Earl? Because this part of the call is for you?\nEARL\n17:48 \nOkay. I feel comfortable with it with what I've seen in 10 minutes. Yeah. But honestly, though I do, this looks pretty good. I would, I will need to dig in more about how we set it up in our community and all that kind of stuff on what the user experience will look like there. And, you know, there's just that stuff.\nIntegrations\nEARL\n18:09 \nBut in terms of the infrastructure for how it's connected together, it really makes a lot of sense and the fact that they're provisioning the users into Chiba from our customer accounts. And I'm assuming we can describe rules around which ones we will need to provision. And, you know, that kind of thing mapping rules, you know, then that happens kinda automatically for us so to speak, and we get the data coming back to hook it up to the classes to track their completion. So this is great. I like it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Earl mentioned providing tailored content using a branch concept, allowing access control of what users have access to in Docebo. \n• Ferhat explained that integrating with Salesforce would bring completion records, progress status and enrollments back to custom objects. \n• Earl noted the need to establish connections user in the community to associate contacts with users and monitor their courses and track completion.

{"prompt":"TRACI\n18:41 \nOkay, great.\nFERHAT\n18:43 \nAwesome. Sounds good. And we can share more knowledge base articles that goes into detail how this app works and how the communities and better experiences looks like. So you can read and see how it can work for you as well. So it would have more details about how they work.\nEARL\n18:59 \nYeah. If you could just send that, send any kind of documentation in my way on that kind of stuff. So I can read it off line and that will be probably good enough for right now.\nTRACI\n19:11 \nGreat.\nFERHAT\n19:11 \nAwesome. Thank you.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n19:13 \nYeah, Ferhat, if you want to send that my way, I'll forward it to the team.\nFERHAT\n19:16 \nOf course.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n19:17 \nThank you so much. Awesome. All right, wonderful. Thank you so much. So now we're going to continue off where we last left off last time. For the remainder of this call, we'll quickly take a look at the type of analytics that table provides and how we kind of like the model in terms of which we abide by in that capacity.\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n19:32 \nAnd then we're going to review the proposal in terms of what was proposed in the proposal to maintain the pricing under a specific budget area for year one. And then what kind of it gets expanded upon in year two, just to make sure we're on the same page at a use.\nOnboarding\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n19:44 \nI know Gloria and Traci is the first time we're talking this year. And then for the next step, I'm gonna hand things off to Stephanie and Stephanie is gonna walk you through the onboarding process and make sure we have a proper plan in place with all things considered. So.\nOnboarding ends\nEARL\n19:56 \nI need, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to drop in and I have a couple of questions that I would like to ask before I drop. So, and this may be for Tracy, but for the group, are we envisioning that PDI employees would be able to access the cio for training curricula outside of the Salesforce environment?\nIntegrations\nTRACI\n20:18 \nThey would be automatically, yeah, we would bring their records in from adp, so that's the other side of the integration. From that point, they would not come in through Salesforce.\nEARL\n20:26 \nRight. Perfect. Because I don't want to have to buy sales.\nTRACI\n20:29 \nRight. Exactly 100 percent.\nEARL\n20:32 \nOkay, cool. So then the only Salesforce, the only learning stuff for Salesforce would be for customer facing content, the customers access on connections, right?\nIntegrations ends\nTRACI\n20:46 \nThat's correct? Yes. And.\nEARL\n20:47 \nThen internal stuff is done. All right now, I'm assuming that you got like, you know, you have like single sign on integration with Octa and stuff like that or how case, yeah, that should work.\nJODIE\n21:00 \nYeah, we would go through act.\nEARL\n21:02 \nYeah, we go through act for the internal access to it. Okay?\nTRACI\n21:07 \nAnd one quick thing that I will mention is that right now we embed the videos for our video learning into PDI connections, which is our Salesforce, our community. And so this may alter how those videos are presented. They would be presented back over in the Docebo environment instead of that. So we will kind of probably.\nEARL\n21:31 \nI love that.\nTRACI\n21:33 \nWe will, we will skin this from a customer facing perspective. So… it carries with it that same look and feel. And so that's that I think that's the plan at this point.\nEARL\n21:48 \nOkay. That's great. So far. So good. That sounds great to me. Don't have to buy a bunch of Salesforce licenses. And now we'll have to deal with, you know, a lot of this integration between these custom objects that we have and showing that stuff and connections for your training classes. So it's…\nTRACI\n22:05 \nRight.\nEARL\n22:06 \nReally attractive to me.\nTRACI\n22:08 \nGood. Okay.\nGLORIA\n22:09 \nWe learned early or learned the hard way early. Yeah. Hey.\nTRACI\n22:14 \nJust built it for little, you know, as I keep telling everyone other than the Salesforce changes, which I know cost time and effort. We built it for nothing based on what we had, but it's not as extensive as what we want. It's not as it's not as clean or does you know, does the things that we want it to do, right? So barring additional changes to Salesforce to make it work differently, we need a better solution. This is the better solution.\nEARL\n22:40 \nYeah. And it's a full LMS, which is…\nTRACI\n22:42 \nIt…\nFERHAT\n22:42 \nHow…\nTRACI\n22:43 \nCrazy. Would that?\nGLORIA\n22:44 \nRight. Super crazy.\nTRACI\n22:47 \nYeah. All right.\nEARL\n22:50 \nOkay. Sorry. Thank you for allowing me to interact. Keep going.\nTRACI\n22:53 \nThank…\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n22:56 \nThanks. No worries at all. Just look out for my email after the call today. I will send over that Salesforce content that they, for it's gonna forward my way. And if you have any follow up questions at all, we're pretty good about getting answers your way either by text or we can record a video if it's something more visual. So just don't hesitate to reach out at any time.\nEARL\n23:14 \nYou bet. I'm gonna go on mute listening until I have to drop off so good to meet you all and look forward to working with.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n23:20 \nLikewise. Sure thing. All right. Wonderful. So, I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen again, just gonna get those slides back that I was showing.\nSTEPHANIE\n23:28 \nAnd we're not going to spend…\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n23:29 \nToo much time on this just because I know we have a lot of other things to get to but I kinda wanted to reintroduce this concept and make the team aware. And this is primarily because of what was demonstrated about four or five months ago because obviously a lot has changed since then, just in terms of how we operate from an analytics capacity. So, it's gonna skip through here. And we are over here now. So when it.\nCustom Reports\nSTEPHANIE\n23:51 \nComes to an…\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n23:51 \nAnalytics perspective. Docebo has actually now four main tools in which we deliver analytics, the learn LMS. So that's just the core MS, we have our canned reports. We have our custom reports. You have the ability to dig into pretty much anything from a learning data perspective.\nCustom Reports ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n24:06 \nA learning impact. If you recall from a demonstration and I can send over recordings is the survey system that we have which contains standardized surveys that you can send to your learners and be able to report on the results. The end goal there is to understand the impact of your learning on the learner following Patrick model which I'll show you in just a moment.\nIntegrations\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n24:24 \nLearning analytics has actually changed now that was being able to present data between learning data to business KPI'S. So for example, I used to be where we could bring in Salesforce data or bring in data from another tool and compare that to learning data that's actually now been relegated over to learn data.\nIntegrations ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n24:40 \nSo apologies for, I know the analytics and data and it says 100 times, so make it confusing. But learning analytics is now primarily dedicated towards driving peer learning data. So it's not just about like completion. It's actually more about understanding how your learners are learning, which devices are they primarily accessing, things from generating overall user scores that provides different pieces of learning data, kinda drive forward a specific data point that will help you understand the overall quality of your learning.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • They discussed integrating PDI employees into the CIO system.\n• Integrations with Okta and ADP were discussed.\n• Stephanie reviewed the onboarding process.\n• Christian shared information on Docebo's four main analytics tools: LMS, canned reports, custom reports, and learning impact surveys to measure the impact of learning on learners.  END"}
{"prompt":"CHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n25:10 \nSo it's primarily the learning areas of learning analytics. Learning data is now actually a tool that will send wrangle information from Docebo into a data warehouse and over to your business intelligence tools. So we've had some changes in the past and Ferhat, I think you had a couple of questions about that you wanted to ask around how that would potentially work.\nFERHAT\n25:30 \nFor the, for the last piece, learn data, it's a new product where it requires a bit of basically, it's a solution that… allows you to access role data tables from our site and what it usually requires for our customers to have data warehouse where they can pull that role data to their data warehouses and then basically consume it from their building their visualizations using their BI tools or some sort of programming language? So that's why I wanted to be, I wanted to clarify those things to make sure that solution is suitable for you. So do you currently have data warehouse or any BI tools that you use?\nGLORIA\n26:12 \nOkay.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n26:13 \nUnderstood understood. Cool. So yeah, learn data would not be an appropriate solution for you then.\nIntegrations ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n26:17 \nSo I just wanted to make sure that clarification was in place but all in terms of how the actual analytics are going to be leveraged. And actually, I think this is a better visual for it. If we're looking at understanding impact of the training when it comes to just basic learning activities and where that's happening, the learning analytics and the core MS will actually give you coverage there. Again, understanding core learning reports will also understanding the quality of that learning or Docebo learning impact takes places under reaction learning and behavior of the Kirkpatrick model. So simply like our learners satisfied about what they're obtaining, did they actually acquire new knowledge and skills and did they apply what they learned or did their be your change as a learner as a result of the training? And that's done through those standardized surveys which would be automated through Docebo sent to learners and managers alike to understand the results of the training that you're actually delivering their way, learn data and Docebo analytics. Historically, we're more about actually comparing your actual training to real KPI'S within your organization. Now in terms of what is, and that's just context for where we were in the capacity of reporting. So those were changes made from the demonstration. So I felt that was appropriate to make sure that we're aware of how the reporting outlook has changed from a Docebo perspective. Any questions before I move on to the actual proposal that we discussed?\nTRACI\n27:37 \nI think I'm good.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n27:40 \nOkay, awesome. So going over to the proposal and this is primarily a reflection of year one, we needed to get the dollar threshold over under a certain area to make sure that Docebo would fit within your learning plans, right? So, I, as a result, what we've actually included in this proposal and this is based off of everything we've shown in the past.\nCoach & Share\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n28:00 \nAnd today, obviously the core learning platform, all the individual integrations with LinkedIn, learning, Salesforce, teams, adp Octa, would be included in that as well. Discover coach and share was the more collaborative area of the platform, a sandbox for everything. And then I also did include Docebo and learning analytics and the full library of Docebo content based on the amount of users or learners.\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n28:23 \nNow. In terms of what was excluded from this proposal, for the sake of fitting within that dollar threshold, I didn't include the Docebo learning impact and Docebo connect. Now, I gave you the individual prices there. So these are things we can either build out into years to or beyond that.\nPricing ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n28:40 \nIf that's something we want. If we're looking to use something like the outlook integration which we discussed a bit earlier, I can probably squeeze that under the 60 K threshold if not maybe a bit over. But I also wanted to make this clear in terms of the initial scope of the project.\nCoach & Share\nGLORIA\n28:57 \nAgain, I think I might have missed that.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n29:00 \nYeah, sure. So learn is the core LMS. So really the majority of your requirements is just, it's obviously absolutely necessary for anything we do. Integrations are as what we had just discussed discover coach and share is the ability for learners to be able to contribute content, have subject matter, experts, continue discussion with other people within the platform, so on and so forth.\nCoach & Share ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n29:19 \nSo the entire social learning aspect that we took a look at it a moment ago. The sandbox is a place for you to be able to test certain functionality, especially useful for a couple of different reasons. A, for the cases of user provisioning, you wanna make sure that data loads very cleanly. And so it's a great place to test integration such as that to make sure that when you do load data into Docebo is the way you want it. And also especially if you're an external facing LMS is great to test things out, experiences out before they're delivered to your end Audience. So a sandbox is just a great place. A test, Docebo learning analytics is the analytics tool that's going to be. And again, I know it's been a while since our last demonstration, I can send recordings, but it's one piece of that learning analytics pie about basically taking data from Docebo and coalescing it into real actionable insights around the quality of your learning. Docebo content is our full 80,000 course library. Now, on the right side, the outlook integration is when we discussed about it a little bit over an hour ago. And Docebo learning impact is the standardized surveys that helps you understand stages one to three of the Patrick model, which is, did learners obtain the information? Did they actually learn the information and did their behaviors as a learner change as a result of your training that give you a better overview? Or is you're still a little bit of?\nGLORIA\n30:37 \nYeah, that makes sense. And so what we're excluding is what you have listed here as if the sessions change, you're not gonna get an update move invites if sessions change.\nNotifications\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n30:48 \nSo basically like Docebo still has the ability to send out calendar invites, send out Notifications and everything. But I wanted to include exactly what you're missing out by excluding the outlook integration. So for had, I think you could provide a bit more better detail than that?\nSTEPHANIE\n31:02 \nAnd that's the…\nCourse Enrollment\nFERHAT\n31:04 \nThe, the connect product if you remember, is the IP solution that we have, and we do have build a custom solution to handle those outlook calendar invites to be created and RS VPS shared back and forth with the calendar invites. So still, as Christian mentioned, there are different, they will have Notifications and different things come in their way, but it may not. If you don't have this connect and outlook integration, it won't be as calendar interpretations that are coming from outlook.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Christian discussed a proposal that meets the $60K dollar threshold. \n END"}
{"prompt":"TRACI\n31:37 \nSo, let me ask this question. If I go into Docebo and I make the change on the class there, it will update it and it would send that information out correct? Without the connect or only with connect, would it send that updated information out?\nFERHAT\n31:54 \nYes, Notifications can be sent out with that updated information.\nCourse Enrollment\nFERHAT\n31:58 \nThere's also a way to bring that invite to ics files or a link to the calendar of that particular session, but it won't be as seamless as it happens as an outlook invite.\nTRACI\n32:17 \nI think we, I think we need that.\nGLORIA\n32:19 \nYeah, I.\nTRACI\n32:20 \nMean to say that that's something that Gloria and I would both say would be critical just to have that the connect.\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n32:26 \nOkay. Understood. So then in that case, Tracy, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to apply the same discount as I did everything else and they'll move it into year one. I expect that the proposal will be a Tad over the threshold that we had discussed for year one, but look out for that invite.\nPricing ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n32:41 \nI'll make sure that this is included. So Stephanie, for this conversation, we will include, doc will connect for outlook in the scope.\nSTEPHANIE\n32:48 \nGot it. I made a note. Thanks.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n32:50 \nAwesome. And of course, we can dig into these analytics pieces later like if they're both actually a price at the exact same amount.\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n32:57 \nAnd for the purposes of our previous conversations, I included one of them also to stick within a certain dollar threshold, but we can dig into these pieces a bit more when we have more time to understand whether they should be included in the year one proposal or the year two and beyond proposal, our side of the contract itself.\nPricing ends\nTRACI\n33:14 \nI think the more limited learning analytics are okay for that first one for sure. That, that's what I'm thinking. So Jody and I had had a little bit of conversation about that. Okay, you know, the first year we'll be getting our feet wet and trying to figure some of those things out. So.\nPricing\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n33:31 \nExactly. And that's the entire purpose of it, too, right? We're not afraid to crawl walk, run, but also in terms of, I have to be created from a pricing perspective, this is the way we landed, but for sure. So we'll get the outlook, no worries at all. We'll get the outlook integration included and expect it to probably add about 3,200 dollars on an annual basis. So not anything that's going to break the bank necessarily, but just to get that out there.\nPricing ends\nJODIE\n33:53 \nAnd I know we said we had four learning analytics licenses, I think.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n33:59 \nFor learning analytics?\nJODIE\n34:00 \nOr whatever, however many learning analytics, I forget 50. So we can always reduce that if we needed to make it net neutral.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n34:09 \nSorry, sorry, apologies. Would you mind repeating that?\nJODIE\n34:16 \nI think Gloria said, yes.\nPricing\nGLORIA\n34:18 \nThat's all I said, yes.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n34:21 \nGotcha. Understood 50 viewers is the minimum package. Okay? Yep, exactly. So in that capacity, then, like we're able to be very flexible with when these things are actually added on. So, in terms of the initial scope, you know, it's going to be a question of pricing and resources from your end based on the conversation, we may have some recommendations, but for now we're going to consider everything included but learning impact for year one. All right?\nWrap-Up\nJODIE\n34:45 \nThank you. No.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n34:46 \nWorries. In that case, thank you so much. Stephanie. The floor is yours?\nSTEPHANIE\n34:53 \nExcellent. Hi, everyone. Hey, let me just get this. So my role here at Docebo is I'm on the services sales team. And the purpose of my role is to ensure that you have all the appropriate resources for a smooth and successful program learning program with Docebo.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n35:17 \nSo it's not only the initial project, it's the ongoing partnership as well. So, previous to this, I was an account manager here at Docebo. So if you have any questions as it relates to that portion of the partnership, I'm more than happy to speak to that today as well.\nAbout Docebo\nSTEPHANIE\n35:40 \nAnd Gloria, Tracy and Jodie, would you mind just giving just a brief introduction of your role so that I know?\nGLORIA\n35:50 \nI am the senior director of learning and Talent engagement. Gloria, this is Gloria. Okay?\nJODIE\n35:56 \nAnd I'm Jodie and I do sales enablement. So I'm responsible for the sales training side of the business, excellent?\nAbout Docebo ends\nTRACI\n36:05 \nAnd I'm Tracy Palmer. I'm the PDI university manager. I manage all of our customer facing and some of our internal training, but mostly product specific.\nSTEPHANIE\n36:14 \nExcellent. Thank you. Great to meet all of you. So I'll speak a little bit about our Professional services organization. So our team is a global team made up of approximately 80 individuals and not only are they do experts but they have a background in land, whether it be LMS administration, some people were teachers.\nAbout Docebo\nSTEPHANIE\n36:40 \nThere is definitely a broad range of individuals that come from the industry, the land industry. We also have over an average, I think it's a little bit higher now, but of 16 years of leadership experience as well. And we truly focus on customers and your satisfaction throughout the entire project.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n37:04 \nWe do have a project sponsor on each and every project that checks in on a regular basis. But one thing we do at the end of a project is gather your feedback because we continue to make improvements based on that feedback. And out of those surveys that are sent at the end of the project, 30 percent of them have been a perfect 10, which is something that we're extremely proud of. And as far as our process goes, we really partner with you through the onboarding experience to ensure that you become Docebo experts. We don't want you to have to come back in the future. You know, to always come back and ask us how do you do this configuration? And that sort of thing. The purpose of onboarding is to ensure that you are fully enabled and equipped to understand your project fully. So here, I'm gonna speak about what that methodology looks like through the project. So currently, right now, we're in evaluate very important stage where we're gathering all your use case information, your business objectives, that information is then transferred internally on the Docebo side where we meet with Christian and your project team. Then we bring your entire team and the Docebo team together to align on those key business objectives. You meet the team, everyone that's involved in the project, you then will have access to Docebo University, which we strongly encourage you take our course, Docebo ready. This will provide you with all the tools and materials to get you started on the onboarding project, one of which is a use case discovery document. And this is getting into that second level of your key business objectives and the nitty gritty. So you spoke about adp in Salesforce, person Octa. All of those items are captured on that use case discovery document. So that your, the Docebo project team has all of the details for your specific project that then gets populated into a project plan. So we move into the discovery phase at that point. And we refer to our project plan software as the HIVE. We generally ask for a queen be on your side, and that queen be, is then able to assign tasks to your project team. So, for example, you have Earl that's responsible for Salesforce, he won't need to be involved in the entire project using the project management tool. He'll know when the key points are and what the tasks are that are relevant to him. Any questions that far?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Christian will include Connect for Outlook in the scope, at an annual cost of $3,200. END"}
{"prompt":"JODIE\n40:03 \nThat sounds about, right?\nSTEPHANIE\n40:04 \nOkay. So, outside of the three of you, are there any other individuals that would be involved in your project?\nJODIE\n40:17 \nI can't think of anybody else brat would.\nWrap-Up\nTRACI\n40:21 \nRight, Randy. And then there's one other guy who's on the security team, potentially… his name's Gong.\nGLORIA\n40:30 \nThere's probably.\nTRACI\n40:31 \nThere are probably five of us total who would be in.\nGLORIA\n40:34 \nYeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n40:35 \nOkay. Excellent.\nTRACI\n40:37 \nJodie and Gloria, and I taking the lion share of it. Okay? Perfect.\nSTEPHANIE\n40:48 \nAnd we'll get into some more role specifics just to make sure that we have all the roles covered.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n40:52 \nAnd we, if we're you know, needing to supplement in roles, we can definitely discuss those. So then we're gonna move into the bulk of the project. So that middle phase which is configuration and validation. This is really the core of the project. So although it's only one bucket here on the screen, I, you can stretch that out because it, it's where everything's going to happen, where do you make the magic happen? So, it is an editor of approach you will be learning via the Docebo university as well as our knowledge base. But you will have a guide which is your solution deployment manager that will act as a project manager as well to ensure that you're meeting those milestones and ensuring that you're achieving all of your goals through that process and really making your vision come to life. So you will do testing, you will have weekly calls with the solution deployment manager. If you need second calls, that is not a problem. We work alongside you and work as fast as you want to work. Once all of that configuration and validation has been completed, we strongly encourage a soft launch. The purpose of a soft launch is to ensure that your vision is coming to life as you hoped. This also gives you an opportunity to gather a small group of individuals together to provide you with some user feedback. I imagine you're gonna put all this work into it. You want to create an engaging experience. So gathering that feedback from those individuals to be able and have the opportunity to make any necessary changes is crucial before launching to the masses. So then once soft launch takes place, we can go live. You are supported through the go live, you will have access to your solution deployment manager for any questions that may come up as part of that process. But then you have an ongoing partnership. Once that onboarding project has completed, you will work closely with your account management.\nTRACI\n43:02 \nTeam.\nSTEPHANIE\n43:03 \nAnd that can consist of monthly calls with them as well as quarterly business reviews to ensure that you continue to optimize your solution. You know, Christian talked about some items that may come in year two, year three. This is where you will continue to be supported to have those phased roll out options to ensure success and whatnot, you will also have access to our Docebo support team not only through standard ticketing but really commonly the chat functionality is used directly within your solution. So a simple how to question validation of a workflow you have chat turned on.\nOnboarding ends\nSTEPHANIE\n43:49 \nOnce your onboarding project is completed. One other piece that I like to always mention is our Docebo Community. Refer to this as the real talk. Essentially, you have access to many other users that have overcome hurdles, manipulated Docebo in a unique way and all those stories are shared within the community. You're able to post questions. It also houses our ideas portal where you can vote on ideas that have been submitted. It's just a really great… platform that, you know, you can share ideas and event information and that sort of thing. Any question on anything that I've covered there? None?\nOnboarding\nGLORIA\n44:41 \nOkay.\nSTEPHANIE\n44:42 \nOkay. Perfect. So few questions for you. Talk to me a little bit about timelines. Do you have a specific time line that you need to launch by? Do you need to have your external or your customers launched before internal? What does that look like?\nGLORIA\n45:08 \nYeah. We're still discussing the time line. I know we need to get it at least kicked off before the second half of the year because it gets really busy.\nSTEPHANIE\n45:17 \nOkay.\nGLORIA\n45:17 \nAfter that, so we're trying to define that right now?\nSTEPHANIE\n45:21 \nOkay. Okay. Yeah, because I always like to work a little bit backwards. So once you figure that out, Christian can partner with you to align on some of those key milestones and timelines that need to be taken into consideration.\nGLORIA\n45:36 \nYeah, because if we looked at having it in place before July when would that mean we would need to start that's? Really what we would need to kinda talk through?\nSTEPHANIE\n45:44 \nAbsolutely. Our standard projects for learn alone is 16 weeks. And so that was part of the reason why we wanted to have this call with you today to really dig in to what the requirements are, what your team has and that sort of thing. So if you're looking at a July launch, for example, you'd wanna work back and we'd wanna probably try and have something in place as soon as possible because resources are generally assigned two weeks, two to three weeks after contract signature, and then that's when the project can start.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jodie, Gloria and Traci are the core members of a project with an additional security team member, Gong. \n• Timeline discussions are still underway to allow for a July launch.

{"prompt":"GLORIA\n46:21 \nOkay. I…\nJODIE\n46:21 \nLast time I did this, I did it faster because I had to.\nSTEPHANIE\n46:25 \nFor business reasons.\nJODIE\n46:26 \nI only had a six weeks six week window to get it launched. So I do know that as long as I agreed to do more of the data stuff, the, she did work at my pace. Is that still on? That was several years ago. Is that still an option?\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n46:40 \nAbsolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Actually, Christian and I know of one that launched in a week.\nJODIE\n46:49 \nThat…\nSTEPHANIE\n46:53 \nYou know, and when it comes to that, I, we understand that things happen contracts end early or that sort of thing. And to your point, we definitely can work as fast as you can. But we wanna focus on if you can identify what that minimal viable product is, so that you're building that strong foundation to start with and then build on there, you're going to continue to be supported. So you don't have to have everything at once.\nJODIE\n47:21 \nThanks.\nSTEPHANIE\n47:22 \nYeah, not a problem. So, yeah, if you want to be up and running in six weeks, I mean, all the Power too. Yeah.\nLayout & Content\nSTEPHANIE\n47:33 \nThese are just some additional services that we do have available to you. And, you know, we can talk more about. I was talking about those spots or the roles within the team. One piece that I always like to bring up is marketing. Sometimes marketing wants to have a say when it comes to branding and design. So, do you have someone that you can, you know, pull in from a design or branding perspective?\nIntegrations\nTRACI\n48:01 \nWe do, I'm actually on the marketing team so I can negotiate that with them? Yeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n48:06 \nAwesome. Okay, great. That's fantastic.\nSTEPHANIE\n48:15 \nAll right. So, integrations that I heard mentioned on the call today were Salesforce adp teams, LinkedIn learning. Is there any other solutions that you're looking to have integrated?\nIntegrations ends\nJODIE\n48:30 \nAt?\nSTEPHANIE\n48:32 \nIn Octa? Yeah. Okay. Yep. I have that for SSO?\nJODIE\n48:36 \nOkay. And Gloria, do we, are we doing LinkedIn learning or we're just grabbing the training history?\nGLORIA\n48:45 \nI'm sorry, you guys can hear music in the background. I have a contractor in right now, my God.\nJODIE\n48:52 \nSweet.\nGLORIA\n48:53 \nYeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n48:54 \nIt…\nGLORIA\n48:56 \nWe're going to have LinkedIn learning as well available for the next after June. So maybe I need to look at that as well.\nSTEPHANIE\n49:06 \nYeah… that's not a heavy lift by any means. Okay. User provisioning I already had made note of. So that's completely fine. Is there content coming from anywhere else? Is there a content that you're creating internally to share with your customer?\nJODIE\n49:29 \nYeah, sorry. It's coming from Sharepoint. Okay. We have two separate Sharepoint sites. It's under a single corporate Sharepoint umbrella. And then there's two segmented sites. Tracy, where does your content sit?\nTRACI\n49:42 \nThe content that I have is the video content I have is on vimeo. So it's simply, it's a link. I can either embed it or I can just have a public link to it. However we need to do that. Okay?\nSTEPHANIE\n49:56 \nPerfect. Okay. And what do you envision for your roll out? I know timelines are still being discussed, but did you wanna do one big bang? Do you wanna do department by department? Do you wanna do customers first than internal? What does that look?\nGLORIA\n50:18 \nI think that's a question we, we're going to need to discuss internally on what we need to prioritize because I know that both Tracy and Jodie have some really critical things coming up. Okay? So I think we're going to have to circle back on that.\nSTEPHANIE\n50:32 \nSure, yep, not a problem.\nGLORIA\n50:34 \nDifferently…\nSTEPHANIE\n50:37 \nAnd one other question taking a project like this on what worries you the most?\nTRACI\n50:47 \nMy aspect is timing, we have a conference that we'll be preparing for in pretty heavily in July and then the conference itself is in August, so that's a heavy lift. But I will say based on content that we currently have like I have 135 videos that are in our video library and are ready to go. I have course calendar for the whole rest of the year that I can establish if we've got our Salesforce connection in pretty quickly to be able to put the things that I have available right now in would be pretty limited in terms of in terms of the extension of the expense of time that we would have for that, everything we're already. I guess what I'm saying is we're already delivering training and we already have everything sort of solidified. And so we've got some components once we have the framework to put it in pretty quickly, okay?\nJODIE\n51:38 \nI think to move my stuff over for what I do today? Pretty light lift? Not a whole lot. I think the biggest lift is gonna be actually doing the part that Gloria needs is okay. We have all this stuff. But what are the competencies? What are the career path? How does that stuff map to all that to truly make a learning experience that's the part that we don't have it like written down in a really clean way to just go here, moving it because we don't have an LMS today.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Stephanie discussed onboarding, layout & content and integrations with Jodie and Traci.\n• Traci is on the marketing team and will negotiate branding and design. \n• Solutions to be integrated include Salesforce, ADP Teams, LinkedIn Learning, Okta.  END"}
{"prompt":"GLORIA\n52:06 \nSure. Okay. Yeah, I'll second that that's exactly what my biggest worry is. We're actually focusing on bringing something to the organization that they never had before. So we really need to make sure that this is an experience that will be positive and they'll be able to, you know, just go in there. And I won't be a lot of training required because we don't have a huge training team. So it very intuitive for them to be able to use the tools and Instructor in a way where they can access it simply based on the infrastructure we have, which is very little, but what we do have, it's important that they can actually be familiar with what we have and connect to it from that as well.\nSTEPHANIE\n52:47 \nYeah. And all the more reason, you know, using that analogy of crawl walk run that start with that core foundation, get them interested so that they can create that habit and have access to it, and then just keep adding onto it, right? It's probably what I would recommend.\nOnboarding\nSTEPHANIE\n53:08 \nSo this speaks to the Docebo project team. We, as I mentioned, we do have a project sponsor on all of our projects. You will have a solution deployment manager and an account manager. Additional resources that are available from the Docebo team, is a technical deployment manager. Sometimes they are included on projects depending on the list as it relates to connect. They can also provide you with a service of building the connect recipe for you. If you don't have someone on your team that would be able to do that project manager, we can include a project manager. Otherwise our solution deployment managers act as a dual role on our standard projects. We also offer supplemental hands on configuration. So should something happen that, you know, another project comes in, some, one of you gets pulled away for whatever reason, we do have supplemental hands on that can support a project?\nSTEPHANIE\n54:23 \nAnd this speaks to the overall roles that we always like to consider in each and every project. But I will say I have seen a single person do this with minimal support from it resources. So this is everybody. So don't think you have to fulfill each and every person but just some roles that you might wanna take into consideration. But it sounds like you, you've already done that. So, Gloria, yeah.\nOnboarding ends\nGLORIA\n54:52 \nYeah. When I'm looking at this, I'm thinking about us three and probably… Earl, so I…\nJODIE\n55:02 \nI, Earl… we'll need someone, Gloria from it at this, I think is the guy.\nGLORIA\n55:13 \nOkay.\nSTEPHANIE\n55:16 \nYeah. And the it resources is somewhat minimal so that it's not a huge lift there for most things.\nIntegrations\nSTEPHANIE\n55:27 \nThe only thing is to take into consideration is… the connect piece and having that set up. But as I mentioned, we can do it for you. Do you, I would assume, but I don't like to do that. Do you have development resources on your side that would be able to support you?\nJODIE\n55:51 \nDo you mean the connect?\nSTEPHANIE\n55:53 \nJust with the recipe? So there's recipe building and I mean, Ferhat would be able to speak to this a lot more elegantly than I can, but with the recipe building. So although it is a low code solution, we do always recommend that someone has knowledge in development to support the solution.\nJODIE\n56:17 \nWhat language?\nSTEPHANIE\n56:21 \nOr how?\nFERHAT\n56:22 \nIt's just a visual tool that is accessible through. And for outlook piece, we already have a recipes built out for you. So you don't have to build anything from scratch for outlook piece. Okay. Someone maybe for the outlook side, that has to be a connection needs to be made in order to use it.\nCourse Enrollment\nFERHAT\n56:40 \nSo what you can do, you can reach out to your outlook admin where or if you have it already. So like a shared calendar or training events, calendar where you will start sending these invites out from outlook. So that's what I, okay. That's good. So you have service account, you connect it to our connect product.\nIntegrations\nFERHAT\n57:00 \nAnd then recipe just runs with those out of the box functionalities that you will get and our team can support you with the setting it up and guide you through what it does, how it can work, and how we can connect. But if you want to expand your use cases or if you want to add additional features, feel free to change existing logic if you want to.\nIntegrations ends\nFERHAT\n57:23 \nBut if it is good enough for your use cases, out of the box, I will just keep it at this.\nSTEPHANIE\n57:29 \nOkay. Yeah. So then you can just include that individual in that piece of onboarding?\nSTEPHANIE\n57:41 \nOne thing that hasn't come up yet is migration. Has that been discussed?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n57:50 \nWe don't have a…\nCertifications\nJODIE\n57:50 \nExisting system, it's…\nSTEPHANIE\n57:51 \nCute. Okay. It's cute.\nGLORIA\n57:55 \nOn LinkedIn, we have nothing.\nJODIE\n57:58 \nYeah, we're going to create some shell courses so that we can upload some transaction history and say, yep, that person completed that course for their transcript records and then the rest of the migration, Tracy and I, taking our existing courses and basically building them into Shape because there's no other place that they live.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Gloria and Stephanie discussed the need for an intuitive onboarding experience that requires minimal training.\n• Tracy and Jodie will create shell courses for transcript records and build existing courses into Shape.

So, I don't think anything that was a bad thing last time.\nSTEPHANIE\n58:43 \nThat's good.\nJODIE\n58:46 \nBeen a couple of years, so… it's been about four. So my memory on is great.\nSTEPHANIE\n58:54 \nNothing, it will be an even better experience for you.\nTRACI\n59:00 \nAnd I guess I'll say, you know, we've done all of this. Like I said, we have a homegrown solution that we've built just adding objects to Salesforce to be able to present the classes and do what we've done. So, the work that we did to do that is way harder than the work that I expect we're going to have to do here with Docebo. Let me just really and truly from the perspective of how the ease of use and the functionality that you guys have. So, I'm not nearly as worried about that as I was about trying to, you know, fit the square Peg in the round hole when we did this initial.\nSTEPHANIE\n59:34 \nThat's a very valid point Tracy. Excellent.\nJODIE\n59:39 \nI think the biggest lift will actually be on glorious side with actually defining competencies and career paths and the metrics to measure those and all that kind of good stuff. It's not overly challenging per SE. In this, in the platform. It's just something that takes a lot of thought and time.\nGLORIA\n59:56 \nYeah.\nTRACI\n59:56 \nI'm…\nGLORIA\n59:57 \nGrateful to be able to have that work to do to be honest with you and.\nJODIE\n1:00:02 \nI'm sure.\nSTEPHANIE\n1:00:08 \nExcellent. That's all I've…\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:00:13 \nAll right. Awesome. So, before I kinda conclude the call Stephanie, I do have a question for the team though, like based on the conversation today, is there anything differently we need to do outside of normal goal onboarding that we presented this?\nNext Steps\nSTEPHANIE\n1:00:25 \nNo, nothing that was identified.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:00:27 \nWonderful.\nSTEPHANIE\n1:00:28 \nJust wanna set the appropriate timelines for all the products that are being considered and that sort of thing. But, yeah.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:00:36 \nWonderful. Okay, team. First of all, thank you so much for the four hours or three and a half hours you gave us today. Greatly appreciated actually two and a half still Fridays, but in the meantime, I'm going to send over a couple of things I'm going to, I sent you actually between the last two calls a bit more of a showcase regarding our a, I, so that should be in your Inbox already.\nNext Steps ends\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:00:57 \nFeel free to check it out when you can. I'm going to send over an updated proposal just including outlook connect, which is just that annual fee. Nothing else will change. So don't expect that at all. And then we'll have that full solution we've discussed. And other than that, you have our TS and CS. So looking forward to hearing a feedback next steps or anything else in that capacity.\nJODIE\n1:01:16 \nAny last?\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:01:16 \nThings before we all part ways for the weekend that you need from me, need from the team? Any last questions?\nSTEPHANIE\n1:01:22 \nI have a quick question.\nGLORIA\n1:01:23 \nAbout like what the next steps ahead for Docebo in terms of Growth is, have you guys thought about creating like virtual classrooms? And that sort of thing, is that something on the road map for the future?\nCourse Enrollment\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:01:38 \nWould you mind expanding on what you mean by virtual classrooms?\nGLORIA\n1:01:41 \nYeah.\nSTEPHANIE\n1:01:42 \nSo, there's the…\nGLORIA\n1:01:42 \nFunctionality where somebody actually is attending a course, right? And it's a virtual Instructor led course, they get it. They click the link. And instead of joining just a team or a Zoom meeting where they see all the rest of the faces, what they actually see is a structure. So that structure would have the person talking in one box. And then they may see all of the tools on another box. There may be also within that same page, an area where they chat. So it's just like it's essentially, if you think about going into a real classroom, it's a real classroom from a virtual perspective. All of the resources are there.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:02:21 \nUnderstood. So if you're using H that actually integrates with the Zoom actually stays within the table corchelle as to the actual virtual aspects of it for, are you familiar or Christian? Are you familiar with any updates in terms of how we're presenting ILT?\nSTEPHANIE\n1:02:37 \nNot off the top of my head for.\nCourse Enrollment ends\nJODIE\n1:02:39 \nI see.\nFERHAT\n1:02:40 \nIn discussions about virtual reality that is solutions that can be integrated to including your like custom… classroom environment could be one of them. But I haven't seen in our road map that we would have something like that in the short term. But I, I've been seeing in discussions around in our internal communication channels all the time about it. But nothing I can think of at the moment.\nCourse Enrollment\nTRACI\n1:03:08 \nYeah. One of the things that we had explored was the idea that we could have a learning environment. So I set up my training classroom database and we basically explode 15 versions of my classroom database out and people can interact in that database. I could send them to separate rooms and go work with them one on one during the class.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Gloria asked about virtual classroom offerings; Ferhat explained that there are discussions internally but no updates at this time. \n• Traci noted exploration of setting up a training database with user interaction, separate rooms, and one-on-one capability during classes.

{"prompt":"TRACI\n1:03:30 \nIt was all, it was all tied around Aws architecture and being able to, you know, you would house that data basically and house that information for us. And so… at the moment in time that we looked at, it was quite pricey. So it's gotten extensively cheaper in some respects.\nIntegrations ends\nTRACI\n1:03:51 \nI don't know that, that's I've not ever seen that as anything in your plan. So I think that that's a great question Gloria.\nGLORIA\n1:03:57 \nYeah, harvard management has that structure as well. I can send you guys a link. It's pretty beautiful. That's one thing I would love to see.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:04:06 \nPlease please do because we do take suggestions seriously. In fact, some of the functionality I showed you today like the checklist was actually functionality suggested by our customers. One of them being like a primary hotel brand, that one. So like we do take these things very seriously. So if you could, okay, I see the link in the Zoom chat.\nJODIE\n1:04:23 \nYeah, it's super cool. I, I've used it in a previous life. Yeah, it's wonderful because then you can, you know, especially when you're doing software training, you go like, right? Everybody wants you to do this task and as, and then everybody has their own like virtual space to do that task. And as an Instructor, you see everybody's mouse is moving and doing, and so you can call out like, hey, Christian, are you with me here? We're working on activity. Your mouse isn't moving.\nGLORIA\n1:04:49 \nExactly. That's it.\nJODIE\n1:04:50 \nSuper fine. Or you could do a collaborative whiteboard where everybody writes things on the whiteboard simultaneously and.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:04:57 \nYes, you.\nJODIE\n1:04:58 \nHave to limit the class size is down to like no more than eight or 10, but the learning is expodentially better versus like I'm just going to talk at you for an hour.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:05:07 \nIt…\nGLORIA\n1:05:08 \nBecomes more of a lab type environment. Yeah, I love that.\nJODIE\n1:05:11 \nSuper cool. Yeah.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:05:13 \nThat is really cool. Actually. Okay. So what we're gonna do with that is Christian, if you wouldn't mind explaining that up to as consulting chain internally, we'll find out if there's any plans because again, we haven't heard of it, but not that might not necessarily be the case if it is far enough down the road map to discuss it. We would have to get an nda in place, but let's worry about that if we forget there, but 100 percent appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We'll investigate internally, but we're gonna make people aware of it anyways. If they aren't already, that is really cool. Actually.\nJODIE\n1:05:42 \nYou have to find someone way bigger than us that's one of your customers, that is a software provider that would want that. And I could find that.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:05:47 \nYou can put a word in anywhere that'll be helpful.\nJODIE\n1:05:50 \nYeah, no doubt.\nCHRISTIAN D'ANTONIO\n1:05:53 \nAll right. Awesome. Yeah.

How are you today?\nKAREN\n0:11 \nYeah, very well. Thank you. Very well. It is Friday as you.\nBENJAMIN\n0:17 \nYeah, it's Friday.\nJEFFREY\n0:18 \nHow are you?\nBENJAMIN\n0:20 \nHow are you?\nJEFFREY\n0:21 \nGood. I like your first name.\nBENJAMIN\n0:22 \nI was about to say that's a great last name you've got there, Jeff. Well, nice to meet both of you. Can call me Ben if you want. So you don't have to feel like you're repeating your last name when you're talking to the.\nJEFFREY\n0:36 \nYou can call me Ben all the time. I can say it's okay. You can call me Jeff, but I appreciate that.\nOnboarding\nBENJAMIN\n0:42 \nCool. Well, my name is Ben. I'm an account executive over here at Docebo. I know that you coordinate a little bit with Hayley, and so I got some high level information about what's going on but we really, and I think you all wanted to do this as well, set up this initial conversation just to learn more about what you're trying to do, answer any questions about what we're able to be able to do, really, the goal would be to get to a customized demonstration to walk you through. But I know you might have some other objectives that you might be working through as.\nOnboarding ends\nJEFFREY\n1:08 \nWe might have to follow up with that. So, I see. Yeah.\nBENJAMIN\n1:11 \nYeah, cool. Awesome. So, I mean, I really just like to start always kind of giving you the floor in terms of like what's going on that had you reaching out to Docebo and exploring LMS options to be.\nAbout Docebo\nJEFFREY\n1:22 \nYeah, yeah. I don't know if you guys had an opportunity to introduce yourself on, with Karen down there. But quick introduction. I'm the director of program management solutions here with our medical affairs, consulting arm with Lumanity. And I work with Karen. I work for Karen. I'm gonna just mentioned that so, and, but we work as a team to find technical solutions for some of the items that our consultants are working with specifically, but that doesn't mean we don't work with other arms within Lumanity.\nAbout Docebo ends\nJEFFREY\n1:55 \nIn fact, we do quite a bit so, and Karen, I'll pass it over to you if you wanna do a quick introduction.\nKAREN\n2:04 \nYeah, sure. Thanks, Jeff. So Karen, I think Jeff describing us as working together is the best way to go although I am the VP for program and account management and we have a nice program management tech solutions team that we're putting together. So, yeah, that's where I am, but Jeff is really the man with the technical knowledge.\nJEFFREY\n2:31 \nOkay. So, so Ben, again, thanks for connecting with us. We're reaching out to a number of different vendors just I wanna put that out there ahead of time totally. But you guys came to the top of the list and we're glad we're having this conversation. I mentioned earlier that we work with our consultant group here working in the pharma space and the medical affairs capacity. And we've run into multiple projects in the past where our clients are actually the end users for an LMS solution. Our role is generally in the content development to syllabus creation and managing, establishing an LMS platform for our clients. So we're coming to you, Ben with a nice challenge today, we're not looking for an LMS solution necessarily for Lumanity… we're looking for a partner that we can work with to provide an LMS solution for our own clients and what we just as a little bit of background. Typically, when this comes up, I spent up a server, we build out an LMS that we host, we manage. And in these situations, our clients have, they're generally just building up new team that they want to onboard people with that's not to say they don't need an ongoing solution down the road in case there's updates to their own product line, or policies or procedures, things of that nature. They do have an ongoing need, but we usually are inserted as these teams are being built up for our client tell, and they're looking for a method to make sure that their teams are certified to do their own job. And there's a big part of what we do to help foster this learning environment. But often our client says, well, we don't have an LMS and help us out, right?\nAbout Docebo\nBENJAMIN\n4:36 \nSo…\nJEFFREY\n4:37 \nSo we're I don't wanna say it's a poor term, but I think it helps describe what we're looking for on this call as a partner in the reselling space… we need that framework the servers. I'm tired of building servers. I don't want to tell my boss that though so don't want… but we have a lot of content and scoring packages or other material, just related materials that we've been able to recycle through these programs and create essentially multiple sales solutions for any new clients coming up that's not to say existing clients could use this package.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" •  Karen is VP of program & account management.\n• Jeffrey is the director of program management solutions. \n• They are looking for an LMS partner that can provide a framework to resell, so they don’t have to build servers, with content and scoring packages for any new clients. END"}
{"prompt":"JEFFREY\n5:14 \nSo to speak, does that help frame what we're looking for Ben?\nBENJAMIN\n5:18 \nIt, it absolutely does. And what I will say is that's a bit of a not in a not in a bad way but just in terms of who might be the best teams to support you as well through this. On our end, that is a bit of a gray area just when it comes into the reselling.\nIntegrations\nBENJAMIN\n5:31 \nLike we have a full partnership team as well that is designed specifically to navigate those specific types of conversations. So I only bring that.\nJEFFREY\n5:40 \nSo what you're telling me this isn't new?\nBENJAMIN\n5:42 \nYou're certainly not the only, we have a lot of like consulting firm, organizations and things like that where they're training their customers on a wide variety of topic areas.\nIntegrations ends\nBENJAMIN\n5:54 \nWhen it comes to actually reselling the LMS that goes like we have a whole program built out for that. I think that there's certain parameters and quotas and things like that you might want to know about before embarking on that. But I can certainly put you in touch with our partnership team on that front just because they'll be able to handle that conversation much more smoothly than I will because they're expert in that.\nJEFFREY\n6:17 \nHave some questions that might you might be able to help us out with? Yeah with the… I heard you say I've been calling it. So it might be mispronouncing it.\nBENJAMIN\n6:29 \nThey're all good. About 80 percent of the people I talked to for the first time, call it Docebo.\nPayment Gateway\nBENJAMIN\n6:33 \nIt's Docebo. We were actually founded. So you pretend you got some spegeti, in front of you and you do perfect Docebo.\nJEFFREY\n6:41 \nI like it. So does the platform, it sounds like it might, but, you know, my thought here is that you have one client instance or so we're running. We want branding. I know you manage that, but we want branding for a lot of different groups, so to speak. So how is that typically handled? If you have, do you have one one instance per client on our side? Or because what we still need management rights over each MS, or is that something where you can create an instance? And then we have grouping, you know, and branding according to group. So I'll tell you like what?\nIntegrations\nBENJAMIN\n7:24 \nThe Docebo solution is for that. And again, like I want to connect with our partnership team as well just to see because it might end.\nJEFFREY\n7:32 \nBeing based on…\nBENJAMIN\n7:33 \nUse case and scope that it might just make more sense for me to work with you directly in terms of how you do this.\nPayment Gateway\nBENJAMIN\n7:38 \nBut I want to connect with the partnership team as well just to make sure anything that they would be able to add some education on to. But we have this concept called extended enterprise within Docebo. And so basically, you'll have your root instance or your primary instance, then it can be say as an example, Lumanity, you know, Docebo learning dot com, and then you can purchase sub domains through our extended enterprise. So you can purchase those and buckets of five. So you can purchase up to five subdomain. So that could be client a boss, client, B dot boss, client, C, dot boss. However it is, you end up branding those urls, but basically it will create subdomain urls that you can then rebrand those entire sites. All of that will be able to be managed by that primary instance. And then you'll also be able to have, you know, a more acute administration within each of those extended enterprise sub domains.\nJEFFREY\n8:37 \nOkay. Makes sense. But if we get above five, you?\nBENJAMIN\n8:41 \nMore buckets of five. So we have like you can purchase in like one to five.\nPricing\nJEFFREY\n8:46 \nThe same instance?\nBENJAMIN\n8:47 \nSix to 10. Yeah, all within the same instance. Like once it gets above, let me just check on this really quick. Like I know that we have… let me just confirm this really quickly. I know that we have like preset buckets like up to a certain number, and I just wanna see what that cap is. And then anything beyond that just requires a scope of work. Do you have an idea of how many sub domains you would be looking at?\nJEFFREY\n9:18 \nAt the moment, no, because this is all for future work. You know, I like the idea of buckets of five, but it could very well go above that, but probably not more than 10 a year.\nBENJAMIN\n9:31 \nSo, I mean with the extended enterprise, we have like one to five, six to 10, 11 to 20 all the way up 50. Anything beyond 50 just requires a scope of work to like analyze what the, to make sure that the system will support everything that you're trying to do. We'll just want to analyze that all a little bit further, but you have.\nPayment Gateway\nJEFFREY\n9:51 \nMakes sense. Okay. And of course, with each of those sub domains, we can add firewalls between each of the clients, correct?\nBENJAMIN\n9:58 \nWhat would you be looking to do exactly like when you're…\nJEFFREY\n10:03 \nI just wanted to make sure that client a, doesn't see client V stuff.\nBENJAMIN\n10:06 \nYeah, yeah. Absolutely. You'll be able to wall that off. And what I'll say on that too is like even without extended enterprise, you're going to be able to personalize learning experiences. So even if you didn't it sounds in your case like it makes way more sense to go with the subdomain because you can have the separately branded URL complete and total rebranding of the pages to your point completely walling off people from anybody else.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeffrey raised questions about branding and having one instance per client, which Benjamin answered by explaining Docebo's extended enterprise concept, which includes buckets of five sub-domains that can be re-branded and managed by a primary instance. \n• Jeffrey also asked about firewalls between each of the clients, which Benjamin clarified as possible. END"}
{"prompt":"JEFFREY\n10:28 \nRight.\nBENJAMIN\n10:29 \nSee anything, you know, they won't even have access to the URL to get there because they'll have another clients URL to get to that space. So they won't even have access to get to the other site. But within even the primary instance, you can create different page experiences that only certain users have access to. So even without extended enterprise, you can in a sense wall people off from getting to other areas or what they even have visibility into.\nJEFFREY\n10:53 \nExcellent. All right. Next challenge. This is all about the challenging questions. Then be ready for it. So far. You're doing pretty good. The it's the data like question.\nPayment Gateway ends\nJEFFREY\n11:03 \nSo our clients hell typically have their own data repositories and those typically sit inside Sharepoint inside of believe it, not a viva repository, which is a Sharepoint repository inside of essentially Salesforce. Okay. So there's a lot of just crazy stuff. But essentially, what they're looking for is they have a library reference material and they want to be able to insert reference material into the courses that's typical.\nIntegrations\nJEFFREY\n11:29 \nBut they also want to have this library available to their learners to be able to go back, pull up. But they don't want to change it in Docebo. They don't want to change it in an Sharepoint. And Docebo does that kinda make sense? Yeah. Are there connections or integrations into data like solutions?\nMobile App\nBENJAMIN\n11:48 \nWith Sharepoint specifically, probably not if I'm being honest with you.\nJEFFREY\n11:51 \nYeah, that be like Sharepoint.\nBENJAMIN\n11:53 \nHave something sort of like that with Google drive where if you have documents that are in Google drive, any changes that are being made to them in Google drive or automatically being reflected within the content within Docebo… you know… that's probably the best answer that I've got there.\nMobile App ends\nBENJAMIN\n12:15 \nI mean, I can certainly poke some people on my end just around when they get questions about external data lakes and things like that. What are some things that they should be thinking about? That maybe I'm not thinking about right now, but that's probably the best I've got for you right now.\nLearning Plans\nJEFFREY\n12:29 \nAll right. Well, if we could put that on the things to follow up on one of the questions we have. And I think this goes without saying, but I just wanted to be clear about it with the you, do you have the ability to mix both voluntary coursework along with a core syllabus?\nBENJAMIN\n12:47 \nYes. So we have this concept called learning plans which is where you can basically stack courses, combine courses together as part of a broader curriculum. If that's what you, how you'd want to describe it. You can package those in, you know, required mandatory ways where people are automatically assigned to things. If they need to be, you can also serve them up in something that's called what we call a catalog. And this is just Docebo terminology that other LMS might call slightly different things, but.\nJEFFREY\n13:16 \nI think I understand what you're getting to. Yeah.\nBENJAMIN\n13:19 \nCan serve them up in a catalog so that people can go in and browse content that is available to them, but they're not necessarily required to take.\nLearning Plans ends\nBENJAMIN\n13:26 \nAnd so they could enroll themselves into that content. They could search for it through the global search. They could also, you could set up pages that have each of the catalogs that specific user is enrolled into for them to be able to search through and see what's available to.\nPayment Gateway\nJEFFREY\n13:40 \nAnd I imagine that's configurable through your extended enterprise solution per instance, right? Subdomain.\nBENJAMIN\n13:48 \nExactly. And that doesn't actually require extended enterprise to be able to do that. Like just as an example for like our customers that are just using it for their own internal use. What a sales person needs to see is different from what someone on the HR team needs to see, which is different from what a new leader needs to see.\nLayout & Content\nBENJAMIN\n14:06 \nAnd so you can serve up those unique experience page experiences. And based on Branches or groups that those learners fall into, you can automatically enroll them into content or serve up certain pages or catalogues or whatever that might be. So we're really going to try and personalize that as much as possible. But yeah to your point, when that's in the extended enterprise environment, you're able to personalize that even further?\nLayout & Content ends\nJEFFREY\n14:29 \nAs far as recommendations and does that tie in with the AI element that I saw on the website? So, what…\nBENJAMIN\n14:37 \nIs really doing is when you're uploading content into the platform, it's automatically scanning that document, transcribing that document so that you can search for it in the global search. And it's also auto tagging it with 10 auto tags. You obviously have as an administrator, have the ability to go in and add additional tags into that will make it easier to find in the global search. But yes, based on your footprint or other learner footprints that are similar to yours in the same Branches or groups or whatever that might be, it will recommend like.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeffrey and Benjamin discussed ways that clients can utilize data repositories, integrations into data solutions, mobile apps, learning plans and payment gateways.

{"prompt":"JEFFREY\n25:09 \nWe have that big quite yet, but.\nBENJAMIN\n25:11 \nWell, that's where it's like for ballparking, you know, I wanna give you a ballpark, but I also wanna give you the most accurate ballpark, which sorta depends on where you might start.\nJEFFREY\n25:20 \nHow about starting at the 300 level? Now? Let me ask you… since it is monthly billed annually. I understand that if we have 20 people just using simple numbers here, 20 people, one month, 10, the next, does it go down? I've found with monthly tiering, our monthly pricing, your max is what you get billed for the full tier, if you know what I mean? You know, it's hard to go down.\nBENJAMIN\n25:47 \nSo, yeah. So that if…\nJEFFREY\n25:48 \nWe started 115 150, and then the next month we're at 100.\nBENJAMIN\n25:53 \nAnd so that entry level tier that we have it supports up to 300. So whether you've got 20 or whether you've got, you know, 285, you're on that entry level tier, and it's the same. From there, we scale up by increments of 500. So 500 a 1,015 100 and so on to your point, you can't scale down a tier. So we do, like I do recommend and I always work with my prospects on this is like what tier makes the most sense for you all at launch, where you're going to be in three years? Should we build any of that into the initial contracting just so you have that flexibility. So it just sort of depends but you can't scale down. So I do recommend starting smaller where it makes sense, and then scaling up because you always have the option to scale up.\nPayment Gateway\nJEFFREY\n26:40 \nAnd does the enterprise configuration that you mentioned earlier make a difference? No the previous page?\nBENJAMIN\n26:47 \nSo the extended enterprise is going to have like it's cost associated with it based on which, you know, however many extended enterprise sub domains you end up getting there's. Not the only cost that really has associated with it beyond that is the assumption would be as you bring on more sub domains, you're probably going to have more users because you're going to have a bigger Audience. So the only thing that would come in is like as you add more sub domains, there might be a cost like for your six through 10 sub domains. And then there will obviously be a larger Audience that might make your monthly active user that you would want to be on higher. But there's no like additional cost associated with like adding users within the extended enterprise if I'm explaining that correctly?\nPricing\nJEFFREY\n27:36 \nWait, so there is no per user model under the extended enterprise model.\nBENJAMIN\n27:40 \nLike to give you just like an idea on it. And I can like give you some ballparks on other pricing too. So like for the entry level tier, for that 300 level tier, you're looking at about 20,000 to 30,000 annually.\nPayment Gateway\nBENJAMIN\n27:52 \nOkay? Depending on just a few variables when it comes to like the content creation module and things like that, we have a special module, things you may or may not want to incorporate or not. So I sort of give you that range. And then with extended enterprise, you're basically paying annually as well for those sub domains.\nPricing\nBENJAMIN\n28:11 \nSo like one to five subdomain domains is about 11,000 dollars annually. And then six to 10 sub domains is like 18,000 dollars annually. So it's there's a cost associated with getting the extended enterprise itself. Like getting those sub domains from there, everyone is considered part of the monthly active user. So if you have a 1,000 monthly active users, it really doesn't matter if they're all 1,000 coming from subdomain a, or if maybe 200 are coming from five different sub domains, it really doesn't matter like we're considering all the monthly active users from everything.\nJEFFREY\n28:46 \nLet's say we stick at 300 users, we're using 300 users that's 20,000 a year, roughly 20 to 30. And if we do have the extended enterprise, that would just be, we have only five sub domains that's 11,000 on top of that roughly from an estimate perspective.\nBENJAMIN\n29:04 \nExactly, right. And then the one other cost that's important to call out is the one time onboarding and that's really where we'll work with you to enable you on how to use the platform, offer, platform configuration through a 16 week program that we have in place that all of our customers utilize, and that's 13,000 as a one.\nPayment Gateway\nJEFFREY\n29:21 \nOkay. Gotcha. Cool.\nBENJAMIN\n29:26 \nWhat I will say is, and again, when the time's right? And you want me to have that conversation with our partnership team, I absolutely can to see if it makes more sense for you to go that route or whether it makes more sense for you to just work through me and then you go the extended enterprise route.\nNext Steps\nBENJAMIN\n29:40 \nDo you have a timeline in terms? Actually, I just realized I have a hard stop at 11 30. So I'm gonna have to.\nJEFFREY\n29:45 \nI will know more in two weeks. Okay. Work for you 10.\nBENJAMIN\n29:48 \nPerfect. And I'll shoot you an email here as well after this, and you can just reply to that with any other questions or anything like that. You?\nWrap-Up\nJEFFREY\n29:53 \nAwesome. Thank you. Have a wonderful Friday. This has been very informative I.\nBENJAMIN\n29:57 \nThank you all as well.\nJEFFREY\n29:58 \nTalk to you later.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" • Jeffrey discussed monthly tiering and the cost of the entry tier which is up to 300 users.\n• Pricing was discussed: 20,000-30,000 annually for the entry level tier; 11,000 annually for 1-5 sub domains; 18,000 annually for 6-10 sub domains; 13,000 one-time onboarding fee.\n• A timeline was established to figure out more in two weeks.
