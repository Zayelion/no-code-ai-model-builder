We went for a late dinner over the family day long weekend & it was busier than we are used to it being (I was hoping if we went late it would be quieter). This caused problems for me due to temporary medical issues. I realized soon after we ordered I wouldn't be able to stay so we requested our order to be take-out instead of dine-in.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Spanish Tavern\\nReview: Food was good, but that was about it.  The new management probably should have spent some time understanding the business before canning the staff.  The $50 twin lobster came with margarine (or something that tasted just like margarine), rather than butter.  I first thought that the lobster was spoiled, but it was fine, and cooked very good.  For dinner rolls they were good and served with very good garlic butter (butter for the rolls, but not lobster, go figure..).  But the problem with the rolls was that it was a big deal to have more than one - had to ask each time, unlike before when the basket was always full (so left the place hungry).  They also had some weird glass partitions that made moving around quite difficult - oh well.  So, probably not a terrible place to eat, but definitely not like the old Spanish Tavern that I have gone to for decades.  For the price of the meal, details do matter.\\nStar Rating: 2\\nReviewer's Name: Mike\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback, Mike.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Brasserie Mon Chou Chou\\nReview: The Crisp Duck Confit in a Green Peppercorn Sauce with Potato Pur√©e is a dish that promises to deliver a rich and satisfying culinary experience. Upon first sight, the dish is presented with a generous portion of tender and crispy duck confit that is cooked to perfection, and beautifully plated.\\n\\nAs I take my first bite, the crispy skin gives way to the succulent and juicy meat beneath, bursting with flavors and aroma that are a feast for the senses. The green peppercorn sauce, elevates the dish to another level, providing a satisfying kick that complements the richness of the duck confit perfectly. The sauce also adds a refreshing dimension to the dish that balances out the richness of the duck.\\n\\nThe accompanying potato puree is a perfect match for the duck confit, its silky texture and buttery flavor complementing the bold flavors of the dish. The puree is seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of salt, making it a delightful addition to the dish.\\n\\nOverall, the Crisp Duck Confit in a Green Peppercorn Sauce with Potato Pur√©e is an outstanding dish that is a must-try for anyone who loves bold and flavorful cuisine. The dish is well-executed, with the flavors and textures perfectly balanced, and the presentation is beautiful. It is a great choice for a special occasion or a romantic dinner, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience a taste of perfection.\\nStar Rating: 5\\nReviewer's Name: Quynh Vu\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for such kind words, Quynh!

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Desi Contemporary | Indian | Casual\\nReview: Have a light meal or some snack before entering this place. They claim it as Desi Contemporary but the portions are that of a Japanese meal. Ordered the below -Starters - a. Desi Paneer Bhurji tarts - It was below average at best, 6 pieces of tarts with cold paneer bhurji topping without any taste. b.) Verde Cutlets - They served 3 small cutlets with the hummus mostly sticking to the serving tray (good presentation but not practical or even usable), it was bit embarrassing as you could not share it amongst 4 people but managed somehow. c.) Bhelpuri - Served in a thin paper cone (literally) in a stand and the paper was sogging by the passing minute, not to forget the quantity was miniscule and was tasting average. consume it within 5-6 minutes of serving else the paper would be one with bhel and bhel can no longer come out. d.) Chicken Slider - 2 pieces of frozen chicken nuggets (fried) and put in a dried bun along with fries (fries were good), my son had to use mango tango lassi and water to wash it down, do not order it for your kids. e & f.) Saffron Thandai and Mango Tango Lassi - This was the only thing which kept the taste buds alive and stomach happy during the initial starter time. g.) Dal Makhani Sourdough Naan - Average daal and 1 naan accompanied, nothing special. h.) Sarson Ka Saag Paneer Makki Roti - Saag was good and tasty but 1 small makki ki roti cut into 4 pieces, I expect more for what we paid. i.) Desi Paneer Bowl  - The presentation was good, 3 pieces of paneer with rice and salad, we had to order extra rice to make up.

My guess is they fired their cook but the last 5 times i ordered lamb kabob medium rare its been medium well..Somehow the lamb this time had a fishy taste(only thing I can think of is dirty oil?) Vegtables, especially the carrots are under cooked. This time i could tell they tried to mitigate that by cutting the carrots. It didnt work. Rice was flavorless this time and the amount of pita i get seems to decrease each time. It's a real shame. The first few times I went here the lamb was cooked perfectly. Vegetables were cooked well.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Old Slo BBQ Co.\\nReview: I wouldn't reccomend this restaurant/bar because it lacks basic customer service. Another thing we noticed was that improvements in how the food is prepared and handled are needed. The staff members are poorly trained and overwhelmed to service the needs of their customers. This could be solved by providing them with extra training and it would make a huge difference. My wife and I made a couple of small requests like asking that they check the kegs due to the excessive amount of foam coming out of some of the kegs and also asking that a fruit beer be replaced because it was empty. They weren't properly trained to do that either as it took three people to check the kegs and in the end they couldn't get it done. The staff member we spoke to walked away in the middle of our conversation  and came back five minutes later to say that he'd be right back and didn't come back to check on us. So that was super awkward (lol) because he walked away as we spoke to him. At the end of our visit, we asked that the charges for the beer that was foamy be removed. The staff member who helped us close out our tab  said that only a $2.00 discount could be applied and that the rest was on us even though they have a sign on the wall that says \"we don't charge for foam :)\" We followed the instructions on how to pour prior to this but the beer was mostly foam.\\nStar Rating: 1\\nReviewer's Name: Carlos Rivera\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It's not often we receive this type of feedback, Carlos, so it sounds like you caught us on an off night.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: MOHI Social\\nReview: Look closely at their review distribution. It‚Äôs almost an inverted bell curve which typically indicates they paid for 5 star reviews. I had brunch here and found out why. Firstly, there is a 19% included service charge on any party with 4 or more people. This means your server will do the absolute least and still get a guaranteed tip of almost 20%. I ordered pancakes and it didn‚Äôt come with syrup, when I asked if it included syrup I was asked if I wanted syrup and I said yes. They charged me extra on the bill for the syrup. They are built in a parking structure which is all open air seating so there is no air condition and it can get hot in Morgan Hill. A tip if you do end up coming here is to scan the QR code which is only found on some of the menus. Some are just completely missing it. The menu they provide will not have all the items offered, maybe 50% of the full menu. I‚Äôd also ask to be seated in the garage area because the roadside seating has cars passing and if you don‚Äôt enjoy exhaust fumes while you eat then you‚Äôll be better suited inside. The food wasn‚Äôt bad and typically I would give another star or two for that aspect but unfortunately today they had a system issue and most of our food didn‚Äôt come out (at all). They were gracious enough to comp us but there were long stretches of time I was sitting waiting for a drink refill or to ask for knives.\\nStar Rating: 1\\nReviewer's Name: Daniel Becerril\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Daniel, we are always looking for ways to improve, so we take your experience to heart.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Brasserie Mon Chou Chou\\nReview: When at a restaurant like this, my understanding is that you are paying not only for the food, but for the service that it comes with. Our experience was lacking in both departments. My sister-in-law and myself both ordered burgers. They were both made incorrectly. When we brought this to the servers attention, it was suggested that we ‚Äúswitch‚Äù plates with each other. Mind you, this was after we had each already taken a bite. Really!? We should switch our burgers? I should settle for a burger that already had a bite out of it? My daughter ordered a bowl of lobster bisque. The portion was laughable. A $25 ‚Äúbowl‚Äù of soup. Even the server acknowledged that the portion was smaller than normal but did not offer to fix it. Later, a tray full of drinks was spilled on myself and my other sister-in-law. It was mostly on her. She was completely soaked. The drinks also spilled on both our bags. No offer was made at the time to assist with cleaning. A manager never came to the table. An appetizer was comped. When I got home and told my husband of the situation, he called and suggested that they should not have charged us for everything and that they should have offered to at least cover the expense of cleaning. The manager did express concern, and asked that we send dry cleaning bill. He let them know that he felt that the bill should have been discounted.

The $21 bread with cheese looked good but 2 bites and we were done. The smell was very strong and not in a good way. Kids Mac cheese and chicken was not good. Seafood pasta, 3 jumbo shrimp, 3 small mussels was ok but for $35 not great. Desserts, ice cream Sunday etc... could be easily made at home with help from HEB.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Limon Rotisserie\\nReview: Went for an early lunch mid week. The service was great. And not too busy yet. Restaurant was more cold inside then sitting outside with a heat lamp so we sat outside. We did want warm drinks, so ordered a tea and a coffee while we looked at the menu. The coffee was luke warm and cold with the added cream. I sent it back and got a different one. When I requested a warm of the coffee at the end of our meal same thing. We ordered kale salads, chicken and fries, and ceviche. Kale as a salad can handle ...and should be tossed quite a bit  before serving it and not get over wilted. Our salads had  the drsg just drizzled on prior to serving so they were dry. The chicken and fries had the sauce poured over both, which was my fault as I should've asked for it on the side, because IMHO the sauce was so salty that it over powered the food. And the chicken pieces I had were over cooked. I still tipped our wait staff 20 % because they checked on us often and were very patient when we couldn't decide what to order! The two stars are because I've eaten at the other locations and have something to directly compare to and the food at those were far better. They seem to cater more to a bar/ evening crowd, as the coffee request really seemed the hardest and maybe drinking liquor first, I wouldn't have noticed a dry salad and over salted sauces.... This place for me missed the mark. There are so so many other places to eat within 5 blocks of this place that I wouldn't choose there for food again. Maybe for a fun drink before going somewhere else for food.\\nStar Rating: 2\\nReviewer's Name: Mlg (mlg)\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi there,\nWe're sorry you were disappointed in your meal at Limon Walnut Creek, especially as you've had great dinners at our other locations!

This is my regulate place to eat. I have spread the word to all my friends who live in the area. I live in Stuytown and pick up.  They do deliver but choose to pick up. I walk home very fast, so food is hot. Lol. I always gets generals chicken which comes with broccoli florets  and white rice and a small wonton soup.  $25.04. Well worth it. Chicken is fresh and lightly battered with a light coating of sweet n tangy sauce. It is not greasy or heavy.  The portion size is large. I get 2 meals out of 1 portion. ( I already started eating before I took photo below.) The staff is so nice. They used to give the most pretty, sturdy, shopping bag, as shown below.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: MOHI Social\\nReview: Last Friday my wife and I decided to give MOHI Social a try and hoped for a nice relaxing dinner.  First,  most of the sidewalk tables are actually fire-pits with almost zero knee space,  so you have to lean over your lap to eat.  Very uncomfortable. The pear salad was awesome,  the whipped brie was a delight and we both raved about it.  It was the star of the visit. However,  the rest of the meal was a big disappointment, all items were overcooked to the point of being unpalatable. The biggest miss of the menu was the scallops,  I was so looking forward to some soft succulent scallop drizzled with the yummy success described on the menu.  The scallops were so overcooked we didn't finish them,  I don't know which is tougher,  the scallop or jelly beans. The manager came by and asked how it was and we told him the above, his response was \"I'm sorry to hear that. \" tldr: Seating is uncomfortable and the food was overcooked,  the pear salad would be the only reason I'd go back.\\n\\nStar Rating: 2\\nReviewer's Name: Rob Holcomb\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Rob, thank you for your feedback and for visiting us.

We asked nicely  for a different table and she was unwilling to accommodate us. I told her that if we couldn't sit somewhere else we were going to leave. She still wouldn't give us a different table. On our way out my husband asked her why we couldn't sit at one of the many other empty tables. She literally tossed the menu's on a table and walked away without saying anything. At that point we just left. Probably the rudest restaurant hostess I've ever come across.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Tasty Pizza - Hangar 45\\nReview: I've been ordering from Tasty Pizza for close to 15 years.  Occasional minor issues are understandable, but it seems like over the past year, I more often receive my food late or in poor condition (box held vertically before delivery and pizza is either crushed or toppings have slid off).  It's become an exception to receive my order on time and in good condition.  I know there are staffing issues, however, it's unacceptable to me that these issues are not made clear up front by setting realistic expectations.  If delivery time is anticipated to be more than 45 minutes, please just tell the customer. Last night was the final straw... I will not order from this restaurant again:\\n- Placed an order at 8:48pm with a 45m indicated delivery time.\\n- Contacted the restaurant at 10:19pm and was told it was out for delivery (I live <10m from the location).\\n- Contacted the restaurant again at 10:38pm and asked to cancel the order as the food was over an hour past the indicated delivery time and 20m after my last contact with the restaurant.  Was told a refund may take several days.  The individual I spoke with did not offer any apology, was disengaged, and did not sound like there were any concerns with my experience.\\n- At 10:48pm, I received a call from the delivery driver indicating he had arrived - I advised him I cancelled my order 10m earlier because it was so late and the driver seemed surprised. \r\\nNot sure if management has changed recently, but I'm disappointed that my favorite pizza joint no longer seems to want our business.\\nStar Rating: 1\\nReviewer's Name: Matthew Meyer\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Matthew.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Brasserie Mon Chou Chou\\nReview: I desperately wanted to like this restaurant. I'm French so it was partly cultural but also they have a 2CV Citron car outside which is what I had growing up. It's been featured a lot, Tanji etc, but I don't feel the real experience of going lives up to that hype. Unfortunately when a restaurant looks good and is well situated many times people rave, twice so if it's French. They are French run and one would assume this means they have the kind of food I ate growing up but no - unfortunately some is not their fault, the cheeses we can get in America are not like those back home, so that's unavoidable. But what is avoidable is how what they have control over goes, and I felt they were paying lip service to the true French experience rather than replicating it. Maybe this happens a lot (Tex Mex versus real Mexican food) but if you tout yourself as French food then it should be and isn't impossible. Granted some fresh ingredients just doesn't taste the same but the menu reads like something from 1980s France - very tourist centered and almost a pastiche of what French food is. Think tourist trap in Paris. Okay so that's not bad considering we're in SA, TX - and like I said, I'm a harsh critic knowing what I know BUT some of the dishes really aren't all that and whilst it's not very expensive, I feel the glitz and effort put into making it LOOK authentic, should have gone into the food. The deserts in particular don't even taste French and the coffee is poor and the cheese - well - how can you really have a French cheese plate that has those cheeses on it? And such bad fruit. Highlights include some of the staff, who really try, and the plating and the decor and the toilets (awesome) and the bar - really good mixologists. Overall I would not recommend although I hope they improve and fix those things they can and come out stronger.\\nStar Rating: 2\\nReviewer's Name: Candice Louisa Daquin\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Candice,\nWe wanted to reach out after reading your review.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Mudai Ethiopian Restaurant\\nReview: I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt check the review before I went there. I randomly came here because we were nearby and needed to eat something quickly on our way. I probably would not have gone there if I read the previous reviews. I seriously do not understand why people are complaining about this restaurant. You can sense it‚Äôs a family run business so the owner is very relaxed and friendly. The decor is not five star style and can look almost sketchy from outside but As you walk around the corner to find the front door, you can already smell the delicious aroma, you know already they are going to have good food. Surely it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The salad was so fresh and delicious, the sandwich was extremely yummy and the lamb dish was absolutely excellent. Of course we were surprised by the kind of bread that goes with it, but this is the way how you are exposed to other ethnicity food, plus the bread tastes like sourdough, so we loved it. If someone wants Indian food or Chinese food, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt come to a Ethiopian restaurant. In terms of the food quality and taste, this is absolutely delicious. We will come back.\\nStar Rating: 5\\nReviewer's Name: Sarah Mu\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi Sarah, we're so happy to hear you loved our authentic food and enjoyed our restaurant!

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Desi Contemporary | Indian | Casual\\nReview: Amazing taste and nice presentation. Loved their take on desi dishes. Bites and appetizers are okay and felt let down. Entrees are really yummy and unique. There are a lot of vegetarian options on the menu. I might come back to try more. The price is not that crazy. If you are expecting a typical desi restaurant with a standard menu and portion sizes with extreme spices, you may not connect to the out of the box presentation they offer.\\n One big let down is the service. We dined on a Friday night, and the restaurant was almost full. We got a table right away as we reserved in advance. We were hungry and wanted to order, but we had to wait a full 15 minutes before we gave up and started waving our hand to order something. As we overestimated the portion sizes we wanted to order more, again the same story, no one in sight for almost 10 minutes. QR code ordering didn't work either. I am hoping it is just an understaffing issue. Anyway, if service is improved, they can do wonders, especially in such a prime location. Rooting for this place!\\nStar Rating: 5\\nReviewer's Name: Ritesh G\\nReply:\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thank you for your feedback, Ritesh.

{"prompt":"Write a response to the given restaurant review.\\nCompany Name: Bella Balducci's Meditteranean Cuisine\\nReview: Bella Balducci's used to be really good, but over the last three times we've gotten food there, it's been consistently not good. They changed their menu, and it is apparent that they are using inferior ingredients as compared to before, and preparation seems to be worse too. Also, their prices have gone up by about 50% since before the pandemic. I know inflation has hit everything, and labor costs in service sector are way up, but a 50% increase feels like some opportunity on top of necessity.
