{"prompt":"Why is it important to start saving early to buy a home?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Getting a mortgage requires you to put skin in the game by making a down payment on your home. That’s typically from 3% of the purchase price to 10-20%, depending on the loan. END"}
{"prompt":"How can new homebuyers achieve their goal of buying their first home?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Start saving by slashing expenses and creating a budget to help you reach your goal. You also could ask family members if they can help out. If money is an issue, check out loans with small down payments such as FHA and VA loans to find options that fit your situation. Additionally, some government programs help first-time buyers with down payments. END"}
{"prompt":"Why is it important to start working on your credit score?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your credit score plays a role in getting a mortgage. Almost everyone has room for improvement. Start by paying off or paying down credit cards: the higher your available credit and the lower your utilization, the higher your score. Three to six months before you reach out to a lender, review your credit reports from all three major agencies: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Each will show different credit history items. You’re entitled to an annual free report from each agency, available from AnnualCreditReport.com. Look for errors such as old debts you’ve paid off or items that aren’t yours. Take steps to dispute errors, and follow up to make sure they’ve been corrected. Challenges to reports take time to resolve. END"}
{"prompt":"Explain why it's important to avoid major purchases when preparing to apply for a home loan.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How much you owe will affect how much you can borrow. Financing a large new purchase before you get a mortgage (a new car, for example) reduces your loanable amount. You also may negatively impact your credit score with a large purchase, since you’re increasing utilization and lowering your available credit. That could have a bearing on home loan terms, such as interest rate. It’s best to stay away from other major purchases when you’re about to make the biggest purchase of your life. END"}
{"prompt":"When considering purchasing a home, what factors should you consider beyond just the monthly mortgage payment?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What price home are you in the market for? In addition to estimating monthly mortgage payments that you think are doable on your income, have you factored in other expenses such as insurance, property taxes, utility payments, and maintenance costs? What you can afford may be less than the online mortgage calculators are showing. When you talk with lenders, they’ll help you understand the maximum mortgage you qualify for. Then you’ll need to make a decision about what price house and which loan amount up to that maximum feels most affordable for your lifestyle.\tNumber of characters is OK END"}
{"prompt":"When shopping for a mortgage, what are some of the key differences between conventional loans, FHA loans, and VA loans?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A good start for exploring different mortgages is to compare conventional loans to FHA loans. An FHA loan for first-time home buyers, for example, allows lower qualifying credit scores and a lower down payment than conventional loans do. A conventional loan, however, can have fewer restrictions. If you are an active-duty service member or veteran, another option is VA home loans. These have generous benefits and terms. There are many mortgage products available. Your best bet is to work with an experienced loan officer who asks the right questions and finds loans that best fit your situation. Then you’ll have everything you need to make a decision. END"}
{"prompt":"What steps can you take to prepare for a stress-free home purchase?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A stress-free home purchase is all about being prepared. You can get ahead of the game by gathering your financial paperwork: all bank account statements, 30 days of pay stubs, two years of W-2s and of tax returns, 12 months of rent payments and lease, documentation of any outstanding loans, and more, are required. Don’t be freaked out if you get asked for some of these twice! Different companies may need to get the information directly from you rather than sharing documentation (i.e., your mortgage lender and the loan underwriter). END"}
{"prompt":"What are interest-only mortgages and Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs), and why are they considered risky for first-time homebuyers?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Interest-only mortgages and Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs) are two of the riskiest types of financing, and downright stressful for first-time home buyers. Although the two are different, the reason for getting these loans is the same – to start home ownership by making the lowest possible monthly payments (and put off paying the principal cost). The thing is, you may not be able to afford higher payments when they come due or if interest rates rise. In general, first-time home buyers are the wrong borrowers for risky loans. If you have a lender who is trying to steer you to one of these products, then you have to ask yourself some hard questions: what price house can I really afford and is this the right lender to help me get there? END"}
{"prompt":"When buying a home, why is it important to factor in closing costs when estimating your total expenses?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When you’re estimating how far your cash will go toward buying a home, make sure you add in closing costs. Closing or “going to settlement” is the end of the home-buying process. That’s the day money changes hands to complete the sale. Your lender will give you an estimate of all costs early on, but many people are surprised by how much closing costs are. According to Zillow, closing costs vary depending on lender and locale, from 2-5% of your purchase price. For example, if you buy a home for $319,500 and closing costs are 3.3% of that, then you’ll pay $10,544 in closing costs. END"}
{"prompt":"When applying for a mortgage, why is it important to consider all of the fees and expenses associated with the process beyond just the down payment and closing costs?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your down payment and closing costs aren’t the only expenses of the mortgage process! You’ll have loan fees required by the lender, such as an appraisal fee to evaluate the property’s value and other fees; a title search fee, to make sure the seller has legal title to the property; and sometimes up-front money to prepay property insurance and taxes.
