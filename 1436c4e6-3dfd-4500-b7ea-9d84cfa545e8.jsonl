{"prompt":"8 Money Tips For Teenagers To Become Millionaires\n\n###\n\n","completion":" you know this video is such an important topic and if you follow the steps i'm gonna outline here today you know i don't see a way that you are not a millionaire if not even a multi-millionaire by the age of 25 so i thought you know this might be one of those occasions where it's time to light a candle it's time to pull out a pen and a notebook because i'm going to show you exactly the things i learned reaching 10 million dollars in my investment portfolio after tax by the age of 21. and how you can replicate the exact eight steps that i took in order to get there so ladies and gentlemen this is my investing advice for all of the teenagers out there now the first step is you have to decide how much of your income no matter how small it is are you gonna put away in order to invest it really all starts with a decision whether you know you're getting you know fifty dollars a week pocket money uh whether you have a little you know you're 17 or 18 and you have a little side gig maybe you have a part-time job whatever it is decide how much of your income you're gonna put away now you might be making fifty dollars a week right now because your parents are giving you fifty dollars a week in pocket money and you might go you know if i put ten dollars away every single week that's really not going to move the needle that much you're right but what happens when you get to a point where you're making five thousand dollars a week and that could very much happen for you in your you know teenage years maybe even your early twenties whatever the case may be and you for four five six seven years built up the habit of putting for example 20 of your income away so maybe when you're 14 or 15 you're used to putting 10 dollars away per week to invest and let's say you land a high-paying job or maybe you start your own business and as i said you're making 5 000 a week and you are used to putting 20 of that income aside that's a thousand dollars a week that's a lot of money to be investing so the first step here is decide how much money are you gonna put away and invest and think about it not so much in terms of the amount of money but in terms of percentage term of everything that you receive how much you're going to invest and bear in mind when you're not making a lot of money that percentage might be very small and even if it's just 10 or 15 or 20 that's okay we're just trying to get you in the habit here now my second piece of investment advice specifically for teenagers is find a way to have that money away from you so what you can do is you can tell your parents hey i'm you know i want to be serious about investing because today it might be a small amount but you know in my early 20s or even my mid-20s this could be a very large sum of money so i just want to get used to and i want to train myself when i give you money to put away into my investments can you make sure that i don't take it out can you make sure that i don't touch it because you know something might come up you know you might want a new ps5 or you might you might get tempted by the list travis scott nike collab 101 different things could come up right but you want to make sure that you never touch that investment pile so as i said step number two specifically for teenagers is find a way to ensure that that money you know is put away and no matter how tempted you are you cannot touch that money and you know you don't need to do this for the rest of your life i definitely don't give away my money to someone to safeguard and keep protected uh you know because i'm worried i'm gonna spend it all but just while you're in these early years and also while the amount of money may not seem significant to you very quickly it will snowball and become a significant amount but not if you pull that money out now my third piece of investing advice for teenagers is get a credit card as soon as you can and just spend a little bit on it every single month credit cards have so so many benefits and me personally i wish i had learned these benefits a long time ago you know for me personally i was just about to turn 20 when i started using credit cards and bear mine at the age of 18 i was making anywhere from 100 to 200 000 a month profit so you know i was used to making a lot of money but i was just using debit cards for everything which was foolish you know i wasn't building up my credit score wasn't getting uh you know the the myriad of different benefits that you get from credit cards like for example pretty much free travel you know just from the amount of money that i spend on the business either way you know these costs are gonna happen either way uh between my various different businesses i i did the calculations earlier i get something like 55 upgrades a year like basically uh you know more than an upgrade a week you know from economy to business or business to first class and that's just one of the benefits right there so step number three is get a credit card make sure you do not spend a lot of money on it you know it could literally just be like 20 or 50 or even 100 a month just something you know you can even just put your spotify and netflix subscription on there and just make sure you pay it off and just get used to the habit of having a credit card and paying it off every single month now the fourth thing i want you to do is actually set up the infrastructure in order to invest and here's what i mean by this for the longest time you know i didn't really start investing until i was 19 which was a big big mistake trust me i would probably have a lot more than 10 million dollars right now if i had invested much sooner they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into so one of the reasons that i didn't was because investing seemed like this sort of scary world to me right you know i didn't know how to set up a brokerage account uh even some of the the crypto platforms back in 2017 2018 were a little like just complicated to figure out in terms of you know wiring your money and this and that i didn't really understand anything about the real estate market about alternative investments for example like watches so what i want you to do and you know in the year 2022 there are so many things that make it so easy to invest you know simple things like robinhood or weeble like it's very easy to take money and invest it whether that be into stocks without being to crypto whether that be you know nfts uh even real estate it's getting easier and easier these days for someone who's not a seasoned investor to get started and get investing so what i want you to do is i want you to set up your you know it could be a coinbase account or a cracking account or a binance account right something that you can buy crypto with and actually learn how to take money from your bank you know whether once again that could be 50 or 100 and know how to wire that and send that to your you know your binance or your coinbase account so that way you can start investing i want you to set up your weeble or robinhood account and you know i don't have any affiliate links for any of these platforms just go you know type it in google and get signed up because that way you're removing any  END"}
{"prompt":"7 Habits That Made Me A Multi-Millionaire By 21\n\n###\n\n","completion":" ladies and gentlemen if i could watch a video seven years ago on what it takes to be a multi-millionaire this video would be it now there's a lot of fluff out there on the internet but here is my honest advice on what's helped me get the 10 million dollars to my name by the age of 21. and by the way that's not net worth that's liquid between my investments and my cash reserves now over the last seven years i have been immersed in the world of self-development and over the last five years of running my business i've tried absolutely everything under the sun and today i'm gonna share the most powerful seven habits with you and i think there's gonna be quite a few in here that are gonna shock you now the first habit that made me a multi-millionaire by the age of 21 is reading and i know this sounds super cliche trust me we're about to get on to some ones that will shock you but honestly if there's one thing that i can credit to my success it's the fact that from the year of 2014 to 2017 i read a book every single week knowledge because ladies and gentlemen in my opinion there is no medium that's as powerful on earth as books and by the way i don't care who you are you should be reading and i don't care what medium you read and you know there's some people who prefer audiobooks these days for me personally it goes in through one ear and straight out to the other and i don't care where you get your books from i remember back in 2016 i would also used to vlog sundays when i would go to brixton book mongers in london which was my favorite book store because rather than buying something at waterstones for 15 pounds i could get something used that barely didn't even look like it was used for two three pounds at bricks and bookmongers and if you can't even afford to spend two three pounds on a book just borrow one from a friend or go to the library because one of the most powerful things i actually found about reading at that time you know when you haven't i guess in the material world you haven't accrued an insane amount of success or because one of the most powerful things about reading at that time or at that stage of my self-development was the fact that i had what's known as zen beginner's mind you know for me everything was new and i didn't have any ego attached to executing on the stuff that i was learning about right a book would tell me hey meditate so i started meditating a book would tell me hey start journaling so i started doing that a book would tell me you know to do these self-development tricks and i would just execute you know without really thinking whereas unfortunately one of the things that i think still gets in my way to this day when it comes to reading is my ego right because i'll read a book and i'm more selective about what i choose which i guess is a good thing as well because you know i pick out the bits that i resonate with and i think would slot well into my life whereas back then when i first started reading for me it was just like okay book says do this so just execute almost like uh blindfully execute and and look if you pick the right books that strategy can be extremely powerful so that is habit number one i don't care how you read but when you are first getting started on your business your entrepreneurial or maybe even just your career path you have to read books to me that's a non-negotiable now there might be times later down line this year an example of it you know where you don't really read that much because you know exactly what you need to do you know exactly what you need to execute on and you're in a phase of your life where it's more about doing rather than learning now the second habit that i want to talk about was getting into routine of acquiring a high income skill now my first ever business was flipping instagram accounts and through this process i learned not only social media growth but also copywriting so i'm actually gonna get tristan put up on the screen there's an account called focus the norm like fc uk because obviously i couldn't use that actual word uh and if you look back right from the beginning all the way to i'd say probably 20 posts uh before they kind of stopped posting that was me like i wrote that that was my account back in 2014 and that account the way that i got into flipping instagram accounts with someone messaged me offering to buy it and eventually i sold that account but that was only later downline and through that world i got added into telegram groups and started this whole process of buying flipping accounts selling promotions et cetera et cetera and it was very short-lived that business only lasts around nine months but my point is through that business i learned copywriting so if you guys ever wonder why i'm such a good copywriter as i said go look at that account and go look at 2014 and that's a 14 year old e-man copyrangers and by the way that ties into habit number one of reading books because i was reading books expanding my vocabulary you know and you know on evernote i had my little lexicon library where i would write down new words that i was learning and then i was learning a high income skill in terms of copywriting social media growth and as i said after that business finished i actually ended up learning videography in 2016 and that's how i got my first social media marketing client and that was back in 2016 and for the next 18 months my agency was exclusively a creative agency you know these days for the past three years we're an advertising agency we made the pivot in early 2018 but really what i'm trying to get at here is hopefully you can see how those three skills copyright social media growth and then also uh creative stuff right so learning photo and video those three high income skills came together to form my creative agency and that's how i was a 17 year old pulling in 25 000 months from my agency it was me marrying those three skills up and really all i can say to you is is even if you don't know how a high income skill will help you in the future just learn it regardless you know one thing i wish i had learned was coding you know if i could go back that's one high income skill that i would learn because as i said when i was a 14 year old running that instagram account and really for me that was just cathartic right because i never really fit in in school so that was a way for me to almost have like a diary for myself and connect with people END"}
{"prompt":"How to Reset Your Brain For Success With A Dopamine Detox\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so look ladies and gentlemen i know a lot of you guys watching this video are feeling incredibly stuck in your lives you have these incredible goals dreams aspirations but you just don't know how to accomplish them now if that is you i need you to listen very very very closely to the rest of this video because in today's video i'm going to be talking about how you can reclaim back your life using the dopamine detox now real quick let me tell you the first place that you probably suck because most people think that they lack energy or they lack knowledge aka the know-how and that is why they are not where they want to be in life well that's actually wrong the main thing that you are lacking is focus because when you are a person who has a lot of focus and can focus in on a singular thing then it's very easy to actually get the know-how and you know the tangible knowledge needed to accomplish your goals and second when you're focusing on a singular task and you can do that for a long time you really start to enjoy it now how do you cultivate focus and this is really where the dopamine detox comes in because let me tell you the state of normal people right now most people on their desk they have three different devices they have an ipad an iphone a computer each one has you know bell notifications going on while that's running on a separate tab they've got their twitter feed running 24 7. and for me one of the funniest things are seeing people with you know multi-display uh setup you know for me one of the ways that i was actually able to get to 10 million dollars after tax by the age of 21 was through focus and one of the ways that i was able to focus was i have always just had one monitor in front of me i've always just had one screen in front of me and i've always made sure that i just have the window open that i need and any windows that i'm not using are closed and can get reopened later another example is even when i was 14 15 16 and i was really getting into the world of self-help starting to read a book a week and you know really just working on myself and working on my capacity to focus and work i was notorious for always just having my phone on airplane mode you know most of the day and then when i needed to use it i would just take it off of airplane mode and the reason i do this sort of stuff is because i want to make sure no one is able to rob me of my focus so as i said if you're at a point in life where you have these goals but it feels like when you sit at your desk you just you can't get to it like it's just it's too hard you're just constantly distracting yourself that means that you need to work on your focus and in order to work on your focus you need to reset your dopamine levels now i'm sure you guys have seen plenty of videos on youtube about dopamine detoxes what they are what they can do for you uh you know how it can help you achieve your goals well in today's video what i'm really gonna do is i'm just gonna give you a framework for the next seven days of what to do to actually reset your dopamine levels tangibly what that's gonna feel like you know what you're actually gonna like how your experience of the world is gonna be different seven days from now and then most importantly how to integrate that because here's what happens a lot of times is people will do dopamine detoxes and then from there you know one bad habit will creep back in like for example you know their phone is the first thing they check in the morning and you know they'll creep back in for two or three days and then they're like ah you know what when i'm doing work might as well just have a podcast or a youtube video playing in the background and these bad habits start to sneak back in so i'm going to show you exactly after the 7 day dopamine detox how to actually integrate this back into your life now everyone might have varying opinions on how long you should actually do a dopamine detox for for me personally i think seven days is a good benchmark and there are four key pillars to resetting your dopamine levels now you need to understand that a detox you know in of itself insinuates that it's going to be a short burst so dopamine detox for me as i said is not a lifestyle it is a hard reset that you press in order to reset your levels so that way you increase your capacity to focus to be disciplined and you know you actually increase your output levels now for the next seven days starting from tomorrow here are the four things i need you to do in order to practice a dopamine detox now before i say this as i said there are people that have you know radically different approaches to it these are just the four that i would recommend over the space of the last eight years ever since i was 14 so from 14 to 22 you know practicing different dopamine detoxes at different points of the year so the first one is one hour a day screen time on your phone now if you actually open up your iphone right now i'm sure there must be a version of this on android you can actually add your screen time as a widget onto your home screen so allow yourself one hour of screen time every day for the next seven days now if your job involves you know your mobile phone for some reason which by the way most of the time it doesn't you can you know even if you need need to use whatsapp for your work uh you could just use whatsapp desktop because it's just of course you're still technically using whatsapp but it's just a lot more focused and it's just a lot more purposeful than just being on your phone so as i said one hour a day of mobile screen time use for the next seven days and even if you need to use it for your work just find some sort of workaround as i said this isn't something that you do for the rest of your life this is really just something to reset the button so that has pillar number one of the seven day dopamine detox reset which is one hour a day of mobile screen time hey just a heads up if you enjoy content like this definitely go ahead and follow my twitter i'm posting stuff like this every single day on there in real time just sharing my thoughts things that are coming in my mind you know things that have helped me get to this point in life in fact if you go on there the first pinned comment is a full thread on exactly how i made 10 million dollars last year in 2021 and the 10 things i learned from it so i'll leave that on screen and then i'll leave my twitter handle in the description enjoy the rest of the video now pillar number two of the seven day reset is no youtube none whatsoever i don't care if you think it is productive and i've seen i'd say you know 90 of people that watch self-help youtube watch it and are just self-help junkies right and just don't actually apply it and what it is is if you know to them it feels like productive procrastination right you're still procrastinating you're still not actually doing or accomplishing anything but in your mind you're thinking you know i'm watching videos on how to focus better while at the same time frying your focus you know it's actually quite ironic so no matter how much value you think you get out of youtube and by the way and i will say youtube is a very very valuable place if used correctly i'll give you a perfect example of how to actually use a you know i'll give you something tangible right here if you're using chrome you can use a chrome plug-in  END"}
{"prompt":"3 Habits That Made Me A Millionaire By 18\n\n###\n\n","completion":" now look i know from the bottom of my heart that this video is gonna create future millionaires because i'm actually gonna be sharing the three habits that made me a millionaire by the age of 18. now some of these might surprise you and some of these might even trigger you but years later and having made over 17 million dollars in profits later and actually retained over 10 million dollars after taxes i feel so now i can look back very candidly and really pick out the three key habits that made me make my first million by the age of 18. so with no further ado let's get straight into it now the first habit may seem kind of small and relevant but it highlights a much bigger issue as to why you're not where you want to be in life so first habit actually made me a millionaire was turning my phone on airplane mode pretty much the first three years of my business was built pretty much entirely while my phone was on airplane mode and i'll explain why you see most people think that the reason they are not a millionaire is because of lack of energy like they don't have enough energy or motivation to do something or a lack of knowledge a lack of knowledge understanding and they think these are usually the two main reasons why that is actually incorrect in ninety percent of cases in ninety percent of cases the thing that they lack is focus because if you have a focus then you will do the work and doing the work and getting into that state of flow actually gives you that energy of motivation and when you are someone who can sit down and focus on a task for a prolonged period of time you will inevitably get the knowledge and information that you need in order to make a million dollars so this is why putting your phone on airplane mode is so important because ladies and gentlemen we live in a world where it you know there's constant notification constant distractions so you know most people the phone isn't enough most people have you know a apple watch with notifications going on 24 7 and their computer is digging here and being there you need to reclaim your focus you should not let anyone rob you of the most important thing that you have which is your focus and your attention so that's why in the first three years of my business it didn't matter what i was doing i made sure my phone was on airplane mode and it was in the other room so that way i had no distractions and i could focus single-handedly on my task now i know what some of you guys are thinking no i actually need my phone i need notifications i need to be able to stay connected in order for my work my career uh you know a new business that i'm starting etc etc and you know that could for sure be true but undoubtedly some of the best work that you will do some of the best deep focus work that you will do will be when your phone is on airplane mode so you know same thing with me when i built my business i had to actually have my phone on i had to stay connected i had to take zoom meetings all that stuff so i had to be connected but the first few hours of my day i always had my earphone on airplane mode and i made sure that i was the one who chose where my attention and my focus was going now if you're in a position where you truly think you know you need your phone uh on pretty much all the time for your work well then i just challenge you at least while you are sleeping at night put your phone on airplane mode while you're showering you don't need your phone on try to find these little pockets of time where you challenge yourself to put your phone on airplane mode and make sure that you are the one who is steering your attention and steering your focus ladies and gentlemen as i said we live in such a crazy world where the standard is so low of focus the standard is so low because so many people are just sucked in by instagram facebook youtube uh this notification that notification etc etc tick tock i mean don't even get me started and for that reason as i said the bar is so low of how much focused output someone can do so that means that even if you're a person who can put their phone on airplane mode and just focus on tasks for 30 minutes that already puts you in honestly the top five percent three percent of the population so habit number one was turning my phone on airplane mode which was really just to signify a much larger issue that the world is facing which is a lack of focus the next habit that made me a millionaire by the age of 18 was choosing the right vehicle it absolutely breaks my heart to see people who work so incredibly hard are so dedicated but yet no matter how hard they work by the age of 30 they will never even see a million dollars i mean really these are people who sacrifice all of their 20s and the reason that is is because they have not chosen the right vehicle now the right vehicle is one of two things it's something where either you're paid very well for your time or it's something that you can actually use leverage now when i say leverage i mean you can outsource to people you can hire people you can uh build a product and you can sell without you actually being the person to deliver now the business that i started when i was 16 years old you know a lot of you guys probably already know my story in the business that i've been running for five and a half years now the business that i started actually was a tick for both of those it was something where i was paid very very well you know when i started my business which was an online boutique marketing agency at first it was actually a creative agency the first you know a year and a half and i was paid good retainers by clients in order to shoot content for them and then actually distribute and grow their social platforms and that was great but really after the first nine months of doing it i was kind of capped out at around 10 to 15 000 a month so that's when i started to use leverage i started to hire contractors and i actually repositioned my offer to run ads for online businesses and that was really when i started hitting the hundred thousand dollar months plus in my business and ladies and gentlemen since then i've started three other businesses in very different industries so i understand what choosing the right vehicle is and how to actually properly assess these different vehicles now i've said it in many many podcasts that i've even been uh you know a guest on i am not the hardest worker right there are people undoubtedly i had to work extremely extremely extremely hard to build up my business and then get it to the point where i made my first million by the age of 18. of course undoubtedly but since that point you know making well over 15 million dollars more i didn't do that by being necessarily the hardest worker i did it by choosing the right vehicles now if you want to choose the right vehicle and the right model for you i actually made this really cool chart where i assessed all the different business models the pros the cons and i put it in a table all visually now if you want access to that it's entirely free it's just a separate youtube video i made it's not going to take you to any weird page or anything like that click the link right below this video in order to access that chart entirely for free that video where i really try to dive  END"}
{"prompt":"5 Side Hustles To Start In 2023\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so look i'm gonna say something that is a little bit harsh but why are you not making an extra two thousand three thousand four thousand dollars a month online with all of the side hustles that are available right now ladies and gentlemen there is so much opportunity out there right now in today's video i'm gonna give you five side hustles that could easily make you a hundred thousand dollars in the next year but even if it doesn't just give you a spare two thousand three thousand dollars a month in your pocket now the best part is it takes absolutely zero money to get started with any of these five side hustles and with a lot of these side hustles you're actually gonna have the opportunity to make upwards of ten thousand twenty thousand hell even over fifty thousand dollars a month if you continue your journey with it and take it more seriously this is gonna be an action-packed video you're gonna leave here with some very clear instructions and i guarantee you're gonna be a hell of a lot richer after watching this video so let's get into it okay so the first side hustle i recommend this year is actually becoming a tick tock editor or youtube video editor any sort of editor for high impact content ladies and gentlemen you'll be shocked how many big time you know content creators that are on youtube that either edit their own videos or just have very very sloppy video editing you can take me for example i was in 2018 and 2019 i was still editing my own videos which is ridiculous now looking back because i was making over seven figures a year and yet i would just put the camera down and i would just the other thing is i would just record all videos in one really long you know 30 40 minute take or 20 minute take or 15 minute take because i was like ah i don't have an editor to sort of chop things up you know some of the spaces so that way the whole video just flows better and this was done because i was genuinely probably losing out on hundreds of thousands a year in terms of business at that point because my videos weren't ranking as well as they could have because my retention wasn't as high as it could have been if i had a good editor in place and plus i just shouldn't have been doing it myself so even someone for example who's creating youtube content and they're making ten thousand dollars a month they very easily and very happily will pay for an editor who will edit you know four videos a month for them for you know eight hundred dollars a thousand dollars 1200 bucks even 1500 bucks if there is a clear roi and if it saves them time so for example you can go ahead and become a youtube video editor for you know current youtube creators uh the other thing is you can go ahead and create tick tock content like you know so i actually recently hired a junior editor so i've got tristan who's been working the company for two years and he's actually in the other side of the villa right now uh just doing some work and you know his workload is getting crazy so i hired a junior editor now that junior editor is gonna do all of my tick tock but if three months ago someone you know reached out to me in the correct way and gave me some good tangible examples and said hey man i'm going to do 21 tick tocks a month for you and you can expect to see a growth of 5 000 or 10 000 tick tock followers a month and i'm gonna do that for 1200 look for me an extra 10 000 tick tock like real genuine tick tock followers um of course that's worth like 1200 bucks as i said i've had a tick tock profile that's just been sitting for two years you know there's been like one month stints here and there where we you know attempted to repurpose some content we've never taken it seriously i've got a tick tock which already had like you know uh tens of thousands of followers was verified which i find funny i don't even have the app on my phone uh so it's like verified had tens of thousands of followers so that was like a gold mine sitting there it's just no one reached out to me properly i guess they said now it doesn't matter because i have a second editor just you know and part of his role is to take care of that but that right there is a golden opportunity i'd very you know honestly i would have been comfortable paying even you know fifteen hundred two thousand dollars if the pitch was correct and uh if you know someone had a track record of doing this for other people successfully so ladies and gentlemen there are so many incredible skillshare courses there's so many incredible youtube videos out there that you can learn very basic editing and when you learn basic editing it's very easy to edit tick-tock videos you know honestly in the space of one week you can get very proficient and very good at just editing tick tock videos or for example youtube shorts that's another very powerful medium and a lot of people are growing a lot right now through youtube shorts so if you can edit tick tocks for people if you can edit youtube shorts for people that is an absolute you know super easy win and to acquire that skill set is free and will take you only a week now if you want to edit someone's youtube videos like for example like sit down videos like this for example to the quality that tristan edits to um it would probably only take you you know six weeks eight weeks to get to you know 75 a proficient level because the thing is sit down videos like this or even most vlogs are pretty easy to edit and the best part is your ideal customer you know people who upload youtube videos they're on socials all the time so you know if you uh dm them on instagram if you dm them on even twitter if you find their email which is very easy to do it's very easy to actually go ahead and pitch these people and the great part is they have a massive content bank so you can just rip videos you know rip their videos from online repurpose it and show them how you would edit it so you know with just a few clients like that it is very easy to make you know three thousand four thousand even five thousand dollars a month with being a remote editor from anywhere in the world working with a couple clients so ladies and gentlemen the next side hustle is even easier and takes even less beginner know-how than last one and that is becoming a discord moderator now there is a massive massive demand for discord moderators out there whether that be um you know just people wanting to build communities on discord whether that be nft projects that are launching whatever it is there are people out there who really really need discord moderators and as a discord moderator you know you're not really most the time doing too much technical know-how all you're doing is making sure that there isn't junk in someone's discord and the other thing is just making sure that the community is very upbeat and you're keeping up the tempo and keeping up the vibe of the community you know really just you know just even things like good morning messages or for example checking with people in the discord or posing questions to the people in the discord you know this isn't something where you need any expert knowledge in any specific sector but it is something where especially if you speak good english or for example you could be a moderator for a italian discord or a french discord if you speak good english you can very easily make you know  END"}
{"prompt":"17 Life Lessons for Teenagers\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so ladies and gentlemen I grew up without a father I'm an only child and the reason I'm telling you this is because I am going to tell you 17 life lessons I wish someone had told me as a teenager so these are things that I had to find out the difficult way and that's why I'm sharing them with you today so that way you do not need to go through the years and years of pain struggle soul searching that I went through and you can just bypass all of that if you listen and you take heed so I've got a couple things written down and honestly I'm just gonna spitball these 17 lessons lesson number one is you need to extend your timeline and I know that is very difficult when you watch my videos it's very difficult when you are on Tick Tock and you see these 18 year old 21 year old Millionaires and I understand that I am even a part of that issue sitting here at the age of 23 years old but tens of millions of dollars it is so easy to see the final product and think that you need to rush when quite frankly you don't I can tell you that I have missed out on so many hang out with the friends grab a beer with the friends watch the football game my childhood and my teenage years had none of that which is why I want you to understand extend the timeline you want to become a millionaire great give yourself five years give yourself 10 years you don't need to rush now I will say if you can get rich faster go for it if you can learn a high income skill and we'll talk about it a little later down the line if you can start a side gig that then turns into a small little business that then turns into a very large business go for it but just alleviate the pressure stop thinking you need to become a millionaire in a year two years and even in my position I understand I did not have a normal person's Journey it is not normal to amass the sort of wealth that I have amassed and by the way as I said that came with a lot of drawbacks so I don't just think it's all roses and sunshine but even me in my position you can see videos of me in 2015 2016 when I was just starting out my business with acne on my face reading books going to the gym being an absolute loner and I say this because please keep this in mind anytime you watch my video or some Tick Tock this stuff does not happen overnight it has been nearly a decade since I started reading a book a week since I started meditating going to the gym and setting the building blocks in the foundation for the man that I would go on to be so please keep your foot on the gas keep pressing but extend your timeline time is your biggest asset at the moment the next life lesson is walk with purpose I remember even from the age of 15 or 16 I would walk down the street you could tell I was on a mission and I think that was really just a sign of having a clear Direction a vision for what I could become so when you walk down the street I'm not saying that you need to Sprint keep your shoulders back look straight walk with a clear Direction look like you know where you're going now the next thing is to focus on practicality and not purpose I hear this whole thing of oh I'm not starting because I just need to find my purpose I need to find my passion stop it focus on practicality when you are a teenager you will not know your purpose you will not know your mission and even in your 20s even the phase I'm in it will morph and it will change so instead focus on practicality focus on learning skills that are practical focus on starting businesses or careers that are practical focus on getting an apprenticeship or even a low paying job that isn't the destination of where you want to get to but is practical and will teach you the core foundation and the core principles to then go on and succeed in your 20s now the next life lesson and this is so important and I know I'm just speaking to men here and a lot of times in my content I speak to men but for reasons that I've previously mentioned it is important for me to put out content and nurture the next generation of men so men listen to me when I say focus on becoming a gentleman in this world and especially in the west I see some of the most disgusting behavior for men it does not surprise me that so many women treat you with disrespect because you are not men even worthy of respect do not listen to all of these guys that have never lived in the real world telling you oh you're a simp if you pick up a girl if you drop a girl home after a date if you pay for the bill I don't know who raised some of these kids because quite clearly they're not actual men the way that I was raised is as a man you pay for the bill and if you cannot pay for the bill if you cannot afford to and when I was younger I was in that position well then guess what get to work don't take girls out to dinner put your head down and focus if you're taking a girl to dinner you pick her up you drop her home you do the gentlemanly thing I cannot express how important these things are to learn in your teenage years other things understanding a girl's alcohol tolerance I see so many idiots that give girls drink after drink after drink not seeing that they are quite clearly intoxicated as I said I don't know how some guys were raised but the way that I was raised if you are with a woman if she's your date or she's one of your friends in that situation you are responsible for her so act accordingly if you want to be a man of Honor if you want to be a man that deserves respect then you must learn how to treat a woman properly never ever let her cross your boundaries and just remember if you are a man that is worthy of respect then obviously never accept disrespect from a another party by just think in this world we live in so many men are afraid of you know coming across and being a simp if you pay for the bill or if you pick her up on a way to a date that is absolutely no way to conduct yourself as a man so learn these principles as a teenager and they will carry through for the rest of your life especially if you stack them up with all these other life lessons then you are going to be a man of Honor you are going to be a man that other women respect and I can tell you that that goes very far in life the next thing is I want you to enjoy the journey I want you to remember that these are your glory years these years right now as a teenager and especially in your early teens even these are the years you're going to look back at with fondness because these are the years that you built you built your character the person that you are going to become I can tell you right now that my most fond years were probably the year before I started my first ever business when I was 16 and a couple years after that the years where things were tough they were not easy I was making sacrifices it was difficult at the time but I had so much appreciation for it now so please if things are difficult or they're hard right now take a moment to appreciate it because these are the years you're going to be talking about in a decade two decades when you're sitting outside with your boys your beachfront property having a cigar or drinking a glass of wine and reminiscing about the good times now if you're in your teens I want you to start investing now and I don't care if it's ten dollars a week or 30 a  END"}
{"prompt":"17 Side Hustles You Can Start In 2023.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" look there isn't nothing more important during this 2022 recession than increasing your ability to earn income i don't know if you've noticed but there is money everywhere all you gotta do is just claim it so in this video i want to put together a list of 17 side hustles you can start today with just a laptop as long as you have a wi-fi connection and a willingness to work i'm not gonna say that these things are gonna make you a millionaire but at least they'll be able to replace your current income now before we get into a list of side hustles here are three things to focus on that will 10x the results you get with this video number one i want you to go ahead and reverse engineer all of the ways that you spend money i know most people won't do this but right now i want you to pull up your american express statement your revolut statement whatever bank or credit card you use i want you to pull it up and i want you to go through the list and look at all of the places that you're spending money you need to understand that business is simply an exchange of money in return for value so the more cognizant you can be of the places where you are exchanging your money in return for some sort of value or perceived value the more that you're cognizant and you're aware of these things the better that your ability to actually earn income will be the second thing is if you are trying to provide a service for someone make sure you reach out with some sort of sample it is gonna expedite their process and expedite their willingness to actually give you money it really comes down to a simple fact which is don't tell me show me and when you can provide them with some samples of work they're gonna be far more willing to actually work with you and number three do more reach outs do more work than expected there is money everywhere but you need to be smart enough to claim it now as i said i'm about to shoot off a list of 17 different side hustle ideas now the difference between a side hustle and a business in my opinion is a business is something basically you're trying to go all in you know business is something where you're trying to make seventy five thousand dollars a year a hundred thousand dollars a year you know two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year half a million dollars a year a side hustle is something where you're just trying to make a little bit of supplementary income on the side now if you want a comparison of the eight most common business models i actually created the online money making matrix i uploaded a youtube video earlier this year using an equation and a formula to basically get down to the bottom of which online business model is the best i'm going to leave that as the first link in the description if you want to watch it anyways let's get into the side hustle first up we have tiktok content creation tiktok is blowing up right now because of its algorithms and for both people and businesses it is a very valuable asset so whether you're actually creating user generated content for businesses or you're just being a tick-tock editor for an influencer or a business that can actually go ahead and repurpose so for example there's so many podcasts out there you can actually come in and repurpose all of their podcast content and tell them hey i'm gonna create an entirely new channel for you with tick-tock number two graphic designer are you great with design then go ahead and look at places like twitter and search graphic design help on twitter you know on twitter people will put out hey do you know any good graphic designers this is actually a very easy way to get clients you need to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of businesses out there that need better graphic design work and the difference in pay that they're willing to give between a good graphic designer and a great graphic designer is massive number three we have a boutique marketing agency this is services any sort of service that could be literally anything whether that be thumbnails facebook ads google ads ticktalk ads email marketing whatever it is basically any service that helps businesses make more money and the agency aspect of it is simply using leverage no longer just doing it yourself but using drop servicing to actually have someone else fulfill the services for you you're just finding the clients and wrapping it all under your experience by the way that business small is actually how i got to 80 000 a month back in 2018 two years into running my agency next we have youtuber do you have something that you are super excited to talk about something you know you just can't stop talking about to your friends and have you always felt that you might have a good propensity for being on camera well being a youtuber can actually be super super lucrative bear in mind it's a very very slow burn for a long time you won't make a lot of money i started uploading on youtube back in 2015. i basically made like zero money all the way up until 20 20 21 these days i make close to 50 000 a month in adsense and for most of for example 2019 i had monetization turned off anyways but these days i made close to 50 000 a month so you know it's a good supplementary income for sure you know even if you're just earning an extra 1500 a month doing something that you probably would have loved to do anyways or talking about something and it could be anything you could be super into chess and you could teach people how to play chess online or you could react to certain games like there's so much stuff that you can do next we have tick tock theme pages now people were making so much money between 2014 2017 even 2018 with instagram theme pages i in fact was one of those people the first business i ever started was instagram theme pages and then basically flipping accounts rebranding them to more profitable niches basically selling shout outs and promotions and stuff like that and that was back in 2014 to 2015. now that is all great but that got very very saturated that's why i stopped after a year tick tock steam pages are the new wave of this so that's the next side hustle next we have youtube scriptwriter now let's say you're very very very intrigued excited interested about a topic and you know nothing against you for it but you may just not have the sort of personality that'll be good for youtube then you can actually be a youtube scriptwriter and you look at the music industry for example and there are so many scriptwriters that are actually sort of the heartbeat and the lifeblood behind some of the biggest artists you can serve that exact same purpose by being a youtube scriptwriter for a youtuber next side hustle is a coach if there is something that you have mastered you are talented whether that be chess coach you know there's a lot of people who want to improve chess you can be an online chess coach you could be a guitar coach and you could do that remotely via zoom you could be a holistic health coach you could be whatever sort of coach that you want you know if there's something that you're very very good at then you can actually help coach people through it and by the way if some of you guys have a little bit of apprehension towards you know coaching why would people pay me just start off  END"}
{"prompt":"7 Money Tips For Teenagers To Make $1 Million\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so you want to become a millionaire so you watch all of the Tony Robbins seminars you watch all these motivational videos I mean hey you even think that your Tick Tock is a great place to get financial education well listen up in today's video I'm going to share seven personal money tips that I would give to you after seven years of running a business and making tens of millions of dollars and most importantly I'm gonna share stuff that you probably won't find anywhere else because I'm not going to tell you oh don't buy Starbucks because you know Heavens forbid you spend four dollars on a coffee because you can make it for 30 cents at home I'm not gonna give you any stupid scarcity based advice that's built specifically for people that have no self-belief no beliefs that they can actually go on and accomplish anything in life no I'm gonna give you seven practical things that you can and should Implement from today so the first step if you want to become a millionaire is stop drinking now I actually have a funny story about my first ever tattoo it says my cup run is over now my cup Runners over means I have more than I need I'm abundant but it always used to serve a fun double purpose because I'm first few years of starting my business I was not drinking now whenever someone tried to get me to drink or try to encourage me to drink of course I politely declined and if it kept going I used to joke with people that didn't know me I went listen I'm a recovering alcoholic I can't drink and of course because I was young they're like you're lying you're joking and I used to show them this tattoo and I used to say I have this tattoo that says my cup run us over because you know my cup was always overflowing with alcohol and it was funny because at that point they would always get super apologetic so anyways the reason I tell you the story is just because it brings back memories of the first couple years of my business when I hadn't made a million dollars yet I hadn't made a million dollars after tax I wasn't a millionaire and in that time I did not drink for two reasons first of all think about how much money you have wasted how much money you have spent on useless drinks at the bar shots so not only from a financial perspective and you know I told you earlier in this video I think it is absolutely ridiculous people are so dumb to think oh you know how I'm gonna become a millionaire I'm gonna save all my four dollar coffee it's honestly some of the stupidest I've ever heard and I guarantee you any really really really high level successful person will never give you advice like that whereas for alcohol I would say don't spend money on it if you are trying to become the person that you want to become because listen that's four dollars compared to forty dollars eighty dollars a hundred hundred fifty dollars you know let's say you're having a fun night you buy five cocktails for yourself fifteen dollars a pop great 75 let's say you cover it for your friend you get a little drunk you go get a little woozy and you're like you know what I'll get this one great you just wasted a hundred and fifty dollars on alcohol and don't forget you would have had to earn something closer to depends on where you live 200 to 250 in order to actually make that money because the rest goes to tax so not only have you spent all of this money on alcohol you have then woken up with less capacity to think clearly and less capacity to actually make money and make your way to that millionaire status Now ladies and gentlemen me at the stage that I'm at I have a long track record in business I have the most incredible team between all my companies I have over 150 employees so luckily if I want to have a drink here and there it doesn't really change my life and it doesn't really affect things when you get to a certain position in life that doesn't mean that you should ever slow down you still need to put your foot on the gas but what it does mean is that you can do things slightly differently so if you are serious about becoming a millionaire this year quit drinking the best tip to become a millionaire is learn a high income skill and this is why I keep beating on about that example of the four dollar coffee because listen people who are hell-bent on the whole saving thing for sure I respect it I just personally believe that I don't want to live a life of scarcity I don't want to live a life where I don't have faith in my abilities to make more money I think if you're watching this video you should understand the goal is to make as much money as humanly possible and by the way that doesn't mean you need to be an entrepreneur that doesn't mean you need to be a business owner if you join the right organization not some old Corporation some stale company that's 50 years old and all they care about is just doing things in a safe predictable way I mean if you join a real good company for example there's people in my company who make hundreds of thousands of dollars almost nearly a million dollars a year because they provide even far more value than that to the company and the way that you do that is by learning a high income skill so whether that be sales whether that be copywriting whether that be content creation whether that be and it sounds really funny but I can tell you as I said having 150 plus employees and there's one special a person that comes to mind if you are a wizard at Google Sheets and you can put together a very good analytics tracking that is a high income skill and that's something that is very valuable to most companies so if you're a little confused on which high income skill is the best in this day and age and which business model is the best one to start this year well then I'm going to leave a link in the description to my most popular YouTube video I break down the eight or nine best business models and try to use an equation and math to come to the conclusion of which one makes the most sense for you to start I use a formula and an equation to get to the bottom of which business model makes the most sense for you to start this year so I'll go ahead and leave that link in the description check it out once you finish this video but I feel like I made my point very clear which is no matter what you do whether you're an entrepreneur a solopreneur you own multiple big businesses with lots of employees like me or you work in a company and you see a clear path to making a lot more money and you want to provide value to that company which is why you are dedicated to learning High income and high impact skills whatever it is just understand that it is far easier to get to millionaire status by increasing your earning potential rather than being scarcity-minded and just thinking oh I'm Gonna Save my way over the next 17 years I'm just gonna save my way to a millionaire is that really an inspiring life to you now the next way to become a millionaire is have a specific amount each week that you put in a separate account to invest now it's funny in my position I've seen so many people make millions and millions and millions of dollars tens of millions of dollars in fact I even know people who have made hundreds of millions of dollars and still lost it all so it doesn't matter if you can become a millionaire if you can't even State a  END"}
{"prompt":"7 Ways To Make $10,000/Month In 2023\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so listen it is 2023 and it is time to stop messing around and get your life together and that's why in this video I'm gonna run through the seven best ways to make ten thousand dollars a month in 2023 now you need to understand that picking the wrong model will absolutely obliterate your chances of any success and not only choosing the wrong model but choosing the wrong strategy that surrounds that model and this holds very very true with the first way that I'm going to suggest which is Drop Shipping now historically I have never been a fan of Drop Shipping over the years I for the most part I think it's a dying model and I think 90 of the drop shippers are just gonna die this is just me this is my opinion you know I could be completely wrong and that is because when you were first starting out in business it is all about offense and defense it's about choosing business models where the risk to reward ratio is in your favor and I've seen it time and time and time again over the past few years where people will spend two thousand dollars three thousand dollars five thousand dollars hell even ten thousand dollars on ads just putting more money into ads more money into ads trying to find a winning product and it just doesn't work now the beauty is in 2023 you can use free traffic sources like Tick Tock reels even YouTube shorts and you can use these in order to validate your product when it comes to drop shipping the most important thing you know everyone thinks the most important thing is having a fancy headline or fancy creative or all of this one no the most important thing is product selection finding the right product and not only finding the right product but in the right timing because listen in the same way I think it was 2014 or 2015 fidget Spinners were the craze I remember all of my friends they all rocked up to school they all had fidget Spinners they all ended up getting confiscated because they would just play around with it in class and stuff like that so if you found that product back then well then you'll be doing pretty well whereas these days that's just no longer a winning product so it is totally okay to constantly shopping changing finding new winning products just as long as you are not pouring money down the drain with ads which is why in 2023 I would recommend it as a viable business model now before we get into the next method just a heads up I can't really go that much into detail here I'm trying to keep this video short concise and compact but I actually released a video where I went through the seven to eight most popular business models and I basically locked myself in a room and compared the pros and cons and I used a formula and an equation to basically rank which one was the best so I'll leave that as the first link in the description I strongly recommend you check out that video once you're done with this one the next way to make ten thousand dollars a month in 2023 is not for everyone not everyone is born a natural salesperson so making it your full-time career and basically where you base your income off of isn't the wisest move but if it doesn't scare you or you have a natural propensity to it whether becoming a high ticket closer is a very very lucrative way to make money ladies and gentlemen there are solar companies out there that salespeople there are agencies out there that need sales people oh there's even software companies out there that need sales people and my company agency flow we have sales reps making ten thousand dollars a month because they basically speak and sell to some of our Enterprise clients some of the clients that have the more expensive plans and in turn for representing our company and educating prospects on our solution and our offer to get paid a commission and the beauty of this is you can pretty much work from anywhere now I will say there are certain countries where you may be at a disadvantage for some companies for example I'll be honest we don't really like to look for remote sales people in Australia just because it's a bit of a tough time zone but then again there's plenty of sales roles within Australia New Zealand that sort of time zone that are specifically looking for people there so you can work from anywhere in the world and the beauty of it is the majority of the world's billionaires actually started off in some form of sales and that makes sense and I truly believe sales is something that everyone should learn to some extent you don't need to make a career out of it like I'm suggesting here becoming a closer but even if you get a rudimentary understanding of sales it is something that will feed you for the rest of your life the next way to make ten thousand dollars a month is by creating a YouTube channel now YouTube is not for everyone but if you do it right you can make a good living from AdSense but the main thing here is strategy just understand that these days Vlog channels don't really work and you need to understand the CPM which is basically how much you're getting paid for a thousand views is very very low in some Industries and a lot higher in other Industries so if you understand that if you set your strategy correctly if you understand how to make interesting engaging content have good titles good thumbnails keep the audience hooked keep them interested well then you can definitely make two thousand five thousand ten thousand I mean obviously there's some people making even hundreds of thousands of dollars a month on YouTube and even just a 5 to 10K a month income from YouTube is incredible and I can speak from experience it is more than possible now moving on we all have our unique skill sets we all have those things that we've just been we've been enamored we've been obsessed we've been reading and studying about for as long as we can remember and this is where online coaching becomes a very clear Avenue to make ten thousand dollars a month online you know there's some of you that have had horrible crippling health issues and because of that you've had to learn about gut health and you've spent years studying everything you can about gut microbiome and understanding autoimmune conditions and stuff like that and if you've experienced that and you've helped yourself well then you can help other people too some of you guys are banging at Google Sheets and trust me when I tell you there are a lot of individuals and a lot of companies who are paying top dollar to get organizational help now maybe you geek out and you're just really good at setting up home offices setting up lighting setting up you know Smart Systems in the house you know that's something I recently had to deal with when I moved into a new Villa in Dubai I cleared out one room as an office I have to set up all the Hue Lights the Smart Systems the this that all of it and if I had someone who I could literally just pay send a photo of my room and they could say Hey you know to make the background look nice while you're filming do this and that and that of course I'd pay for it if I could have someone who would consult me on hey use this smart system and attach it to this and this and that well then they would get paid very handsomely because it helps me reclaim a lot of my time so whatever it is that you have a keen interest in the thing that you've been  END"}
{"prompt":"5 Traits of The Top 1% Man\n\n###\n\n","completion":" all right listen to me very closely because life for the top one percent of men is better than it has ever been and for the other 99 of men it is more depressing than it has ever been because you see contrary to what they tell you in the media life for a man is actually quite hard it's a video game where you start right at the beginning at level zero and every single day you have to work to level up you see because if you don't some other guy will and that guy will take the money that could have been yours the life that could have been yours and this is gonna be very very very difficult for you to hear right now but even the wife that could have been yours and I really want you to let that sink in I want you to imagine right now your dream woman what does she look like how does she carry herself what kind of an incredible mother is she to your future children how proud are you to have her by your side you have that image in your mind okay cool now I want you to imagine her with another guy make it graphic make it sting make it hurt because you just lost your future wife the future mother of your children to another man because you decided you're gonna around with some video games while the other guy every single day put one foot forward in front of the other and leveled up and left you behind that is the cold harsh reality for men it is competition 24 7. there is no rest and that is precisely why you need to become a high value man now there is a big misconception as to what is actually a high value man and that's because most of the guys that you watch online either don't know what it actually means to be a high value man or simply have not been in the trenches long enough you can all be in the trenches for two years and think that you're going to be a high value man and we'll get on to that in just a second I'm going to share with you guys five things in this video and all five need to be true for you to call yourself a high value man this is not easy this is not a thing that you're gonna get done in the next three weeks or six months this is a commitment but what other option do you have now the first step in order to become a high value man and this is really where I see past the facade of a lot of the manosphere community a lot of the red pill Community a lot of you know what used to be the pickup Community the first step is you need to remove any crutches let me make something clear you should be rich you should have a good body you should have abundance with women but if you use those as crutches well then you simply can't be high value you know everyone thinks that they're gonna to get a six pack and then you know all of a sudden here you are high value or they think they're gonna get rich I see this a lot as well you know they think well once I'm rich I'm a high value man no you're not because you need to understand especially when you're dealing with a certain caliber of guy or a certain caliber of girl it's a commodity everyone has a good body everyone's Rich it's expected to even just get into the room it's a prerequisite ladies and gentlemen I've been uploading publicly on YouTube for seven years you can go back to me at 15 years old when I was doing all the things where I was meditating every single day I was reading a book week I've been doing this self-improvement stuff for as long as I can remember publicly on YouTube longer than anyone else I know and documenting it and I only felt high value maybe two years ago 18 months ago I mean imagine that I was 19 years old and here I was multi-millionaire the girls the travel the good body social status you know everything you name it I had it but I still knew I wasn't a high value man I still knew I wasn't that guy you know I look like that guy but I wasn't that guy deep down because I didn't face the boy I was still a little boy because I didn't face my insecurities I may have been the man but I didn't feel like like the man at the end of the day if everything else gets stripped around you and the only thing that's left is you as a person if you would feel naked if you would feel exposed well then these are simply crutches and you're not that guy yet and that is why I don't believe from scratch you can become a high value man it's at least a five-year Journey because first you work and you accomplish and you strive and you conquer and you do all these things that from the outside make you look like the man but then you actually need to become that guy and you will know deep down in your heart of hearts when you've accomplished it and that leads us into the next way to become a high value man in order to become a high value man you must reimagine the timeline you see most of you guys think that you're going to become a high value man within one or two years and it's simply not gonna happen I've never seen it happen in less than five years because there's so much internal work that goes along with it as I mentioned first you do and then you become every time someone gets success they then need to fully integrate into that identity and into that success for me it took seven years from the age of 14 when I really started my self-development journey all the way up until basically my 21st birthday that that's really where I start to feel like okay I don't feel like I have anything to prove I feel like a high value man because of who I am right because of my abilities because my capabilities not because of the things I have around me and it's very hard to explain but you just look in a guy's eye it's the demeanor it's the way he carries himself how self-assured he is it's just it's hard to describe you just know you can see it so for me personally as I said it took seven years for you it might take five years 10 years 15 years but what is your other option it is a long long long process but as I said what's your other option because there is a guy right now who's robbing you of your future life because you simply refuse to face your insecurities your past traumas all the things that most people don't really talk about but all the reasons why when you hang out with influential guys you hang out with girls they'll be able to read through you they'll they'll be able to see even though you you look like you're the man you're just a little boy and until you work on that you're never going to be able to attract the people that you want in your life now the third thing you need to do in order to become a high value man is have ultimate true Freedom so that means Financial Freedom location freedom and time time Freedom listen to me I would rather make a hundred thousand dollars a year and be able to live anywhere in the world be able to work remotely and be able to build the systems and processes so that way I have a great team who takes care of it there's no such thing as passive  END"}
{"prompt":"The 7 WORST Purchases To Make In Your 20s\n\n###\n\n","completion":" when you see videos like this online it is from people who are Frugal Penny Pinchers trying to shame you for spending money when the honest truth is if they had money they would buy the exact same things that they're advising you not to buy oh don't spend five dollars a day on your Starbucks Coffee dumb anyways I am making this video because a lot of you guys know I budget 2.5 million dollars a year to just spend I have a rule that I have to spend 20 to 30 of my income and that percentage will go up as I actually get older more in my late 20s early 30s because I feel as if I'm not going to spend money then well then when am I going to spend money and at least get that level of enjoyment from it because I'm only 22 you know I'm still relatively young I try to be a little bit more on the safe side but my safe side still means that I spend millions and millions of dollars a year so I'm making this video as someone who has pretty much bought everything and can buy anything so when I tell you to avoid these seven things listen to me okay now there will be some things on this list where it doesn't matter how much money you make you can make 300 million a year you should still never ever do it just out of principle and because it just bad things to buy but a lot of people who are even broke still buy these things then there are a few things on this list where if you make over a million dollars a year in your 20s and 30s then honestly just spending the money like it it doesn't matter you have enough financial abundance in your life congratulations you're not only financially free you're financially abundant so just spend that money for the other 99 of people watching this that don't make a million dollars a year avoid these things so let's get into it now the first thing to avoid buying in your 20s are business class and first class flights now before you crucify me listen business class and first class tickets really are one of the best things to spend money on when you have real Financial abundance and let's say you're traveling for business or for an event you know something where you need to be sharp you know you need to be performing well the day or the day after you land well then for sure fly Long Haul business or even first class 100 but the thing is especially when you're flying for personal use that means you can't write it off as a business expense and then the next question you need to ask yourself is you got to start comparing let's say you're flying to Bali and you spend six thousand dollars on a return business class tickets and it's twelve hundred dollars for economy tickets for the extra four thousand eight hundred dollars that you're saving what amazing beautiful experiences could you have in Bali I mean for forty eight hundred dollars that pretty much you can live a pretty good life for a month even two months in Bali you're spending money on business and first class tickets is totally worth it until you compare the benefit from that compared to the benefit that you could get when you actually arrive at your destination you know all the extra money you could spend there I mean let's say you're doing a six hour flight from London to Dubai and you save 3 500 by going in economy instead well then the first thing that you do when you arrive back in London is you go to the Apple Store and you buy yourself thirty five hundred dollars worth or pounds worth of you know a new computer maybe a new phone maybe some air like whatever you want so when you kind of imagine that because I know you know you think about a long-haul economy and you know how nice it is to get the little amenity kid in business class and coming from someone who spends a lot a lot of money I can tell you it does make sense but not when you compare it to what you could spend that money on instead and the last thing that I will say about this is I know I have a very successful audience so a lot of you might be making 300 Grand a year 400 Grand a year and you want to fly business class just to get that first experience and that first taste of it be very careful this is a word of caution because once you fly business Long Haul once you can't go back that's it that is an expense for the rest of your life it is almost impossible to go back to economy after that so just bear that in mind try to extend your first business or first class long-haul flight as long as you humanly can because as I said there's much better ways to spend your money the next thing to avoid in your 20s is bottle service ladies and gentlemen some of my good friends either own or run some of the best clubs in the world so I know the back end of the business and it's just it's so hilarious for a bottle that you could get for 150 you're spending 800 just because it comes with a couple sparklers and to get the sparklers you can't just buy one bottle you need to buy like five bottles but it all comes down to psychology clubs would go bankrupt if guys didn't hold the belief when they walked in if I buy enough bottles girls will come to my table and then maybe I'll get laid this is the intention of 98 of guys who buy bottles at the club and I'm telling you that not only is it a waste of money it's also just a horrible strategy what will happen is girls will come to your table they'll talk to you for two minutes they'll take your drinks and then they'll go back to the table with the guy that they actually want to sleep with so every once in a while you know you may bag a drunk seven in the club but is that something that you really want to be proud of now look I'm not saying don't go to clubs because I go to clubs maybe seven eight times a year but the difference is I don't go there to meet women in fact my security I specifically tell them don't let I don't care if they're a guy if they're a girl don't let anyone near our table and that's because usually I come with you know 10 15 of my girlfriends and my guy friends like I'm just there to have fun relax blow off some steam just be a little stupid but I'm going there with a full understanding that this is a waste of money you know it's kind of like casinos you know you're wasting money but you know it's kind of the fun of knowing that you can waste money but at least you're not expecting anything from it you know I think casinos can be totally fine as long as you go in there realizing you're paying for an experience it becomes dangerous casinos become dangerous when you go in thinking oh I'm gonna get a desired result from this I'm gonna make some money that's when casinos become a little bit more dark and as I said a little bit more dangerous to a person I think clubs are the same way I think if you want to go and buy some bottles and you know just have fun with your friends and just be a little stupid go and that's fun if that's your psychology but going there specifically for the purpose that you know guys usually buy bottles I think that's where it becomes just really stupid because you're wasting so much money and it's just not even a good method or a good tactic ladies and gentlemen I can't tell you the amount of times that guys go back home in the back of an Uber with cranberry juice on their feet a six thousand dollar charge on their Amex ordering a shawarma on ubereats  END"}
{"prompt":"Smartest Route To $10,000/Month In 2023\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so this is the smartest path to making ten thousand dollars a month in 2023 and let me guess you're expecting me to give you some magic pill that's gonna make you rich guaranteed you're expecting me to give you the cheat code the tricks and this is the root of your problems because you want to look at every single Direction except directly at yourself so as the title of this video suggests I am going to show you the smartest route to making ten thousand dollars a month in 2023 not the fastest but the smartest and my friend it all starts with you now Abraham Lincoln is often quoting for having said if I had eight hours to chop down a tree I'd spend six sharpening my ax and it's time for you to sharpen your ax and that ax is you and it all starts with a protocol that I formulated a few years back called monk mode monk mode and monk mode monk mode monk mode monk mode this is the same system that thousands of people have used to turn their life around now I know that some of you guys still want a game plan on what business model to actually get to 10K a month so I'm going to leave in the first line in the description probably my most well received video I've ever posted basically I compared the most common seven to eight business models out there and created the money making Matrix and depending on your strengths your weaknesses whatever it may be it basically shows you which model you should move forward with so I'll leave that as the first line in the description but now for the true meat and bones of this video I'm going to show you exactly how to execute monk mode in 2023 the first seven to eight days of every year is a write-off because my birthday is on the 3rd of January but immediately after that I went on to do monk mode for six weeks in the beginning of 2022 so I can tell you after being in self-improvement for eight years after having businesses for six years I still implement this stuff to this day so ladies and gentlemen what is monk mode now monk mode is a period of immersion and I recommend no less than 21 days and no longer than 90 days if you do anything less than 21 days you're just simply not gonna feel the effects and if you try to do anything longer than 90 days you're gonna start to get serious fomo and you're going to start to feel like this is difficult this is hard you know I don't want to do this anymore I'm missing out on life all of this stuff and the thing is monk mode is a tool that I have used for years and it's a tool that I want you to continue to use for years and years so I don't want you to have all of these negative associations around it so that's why for most people that have never done it before I recommend just start with a 21 day protocol now the true beauty of it is that you can actually do 21 days and then at the end of it you know you can take a couple days to party and relax and enjoy and then go straight into another cycle of Monk mode or you can finish the 21 days and go wow I feel a lot of momentum I feel great I'm gonna do another 30 days and I know that a lot of people go no you should set your aims high and all this stuff I personally believe getting your confidence up and sticking to your promises is the most important thing in life so I would much rather you do 21 days realize hmm that wasn't actually quite bad and then just extend from there rather than trying to commit to 60 or 90 days from the jump now I created the monk mode protocol like Lego blocks when I formulated the protocol a few years back I didn't want it to be frigid you know there's similar protocols out there for example like 75 hard and I have the utmost respect for not only the protocol but all the people that go through it for me personally I just think flexibility is important sometimes and it's important that there's your non-negotiables and then there's other variables that you stack on top because everyone's journey and what people are trying to accomplish is very different you know the bodybuilder is trying to accomplish something very different compared to the person who runs a company and has employees and you know is just really trying to focus and scale the company all the way to the people who work jobs that they're very happy and they're very content with their career but they just want to feel more Stillness more calm more presence in their life and that's why I built the monk mode protocol the way I did so that way it serves you the best but the monk mode protocol is predicated around three non-negotiables it seems simple but that is the beauty of it now the first non-negotiable is 10 minutes a day of meditation and let me warn you for the first 10 days you will not notice a single difference then roughly around 10 or 14 days in you'll notice something funny starts to happen you'll start to be more cognizant of your thoughts you'll start to notice your monkey brain you'll start to notice those times where you feel pain you feel doubt you feel uncertainty you feel like maybe you can't accomplish the things you want to do and the old you the old you before monk mode would have reached for your phone or a video game or tried to distract yourself or put some music on or unfortunately as is ruining so many men out there would use that pain in that discomfort as an opportunity to close the blinds put something on your phone that you probably shouldn't be watching do the deed for five minutes and live in shame and on the spectrum of emotion shame is the worst thing that a person can feel shame is fundamentally I am a bad person and they do that multiple times a day they reinforce that multiple times a day as a coping mechanism because they want to run away from their fears their problems and their self-doubt so I'm going to tell you meditation might be scary for some of you guys because you'll notice your monkey brain you're going to notice your demons but other beautiful things are gonna happen you you're going to notice that when you go for a walk you don't need background music you're going to notice that you can just sit with a cup of tea or a cup of coffee in silence hearing the wind blowing and you can just sit comfortable with yourself you don't need to run away from yourself anymore you and you are on the same team meditation is by far one of the best habits for anyone that is trying to build a business or just accomplish anything that they want in life become the man that they want to be you know let me ask you a question where's your phone right now let me guess it's probably right by your side and I can guarantee for a fact it's not on do not disturb you know how many times have you picked it up in the last 60 minutes to check social media and then realize Midway through while you're scrolling on Tick Tock or Instagram or whatever it may be why did I pick up my phone why did I feel this weird urge to just pick up my phone and distract myself ladies and gentlemen remember the quote from Lincoln you must sharpen your mind you must break free from these addictions holding you from the person that you could be ladies and gentlemen they want you scrolling on Tick Tock they want numb you say you would never touch drugs but you were just as addicted as the addicts that you say you will never

{"prompt":"7 Ways To Make Your First $100,000 Online\n\n###\n\n","completion":" ladies and gents making your first hundred thousand dollars in the year we live in is kind of like making your first thousand dollars back in 1995. there is money literally everywhere all you need to do is have the right game plan and execute and that's why in this video I'm gonna show you seven ways to make your first hundred thousand dollars online now a lot of these come from my own personal experience and me actually paying other people a hundred thousand dollars in order to do this so I've literally paid people six figures for the exact same thing that I'm gonna suggest to you today now majority of these will help you make your first hundred thousand dollars but will be very difficult to make a million dollars a year from so if you want a business model where you can not only make a hundred thousand dollars a year but even a million dollars a year then earlier this year I actually evaluated the eight best business models of the pros the cons the likeliness of succeeding for the best different business models and then basically came to the conclusion of which one you should start depending on your situation I'll leave a link in the description down below and you can check it out now the first way to make your first 100K online is by being a remote sales rep even if you've never sold before it's still a skill that you can pick up relatively quickly now I would say for everyone watching there's a third of you that'll be incredible naturally at sales there'll be a third of you that can learn and easily make a hundred thousand dollars a year by being an online sales rep and there's a third of you that I would just say avoid sales like it's just not your calling it's not your strong suit and it's better you make money elsewhere but as I said for two-thirds of you you'll have a natural Talent at selling or it's something that you'll be able to pick up very easily and go on to make 100K your plus now I have sales reps for some of my companies for example my software company we're literally within five weeks someone starts with zero experience and they're making five thousand dollars a month literally within the space of five weeks and that's definitely a great pay but honestly as an online sales rep you should be targeting 120k a year in fact one of my sales guys for one of my companies did thirty four thousand dollars last month in commission so that's pure take home profit that's his money in pure commissions the best part of being a sales rep these days is the fact that you can be remote and obviously that's a big plus and a big positive and look if you're watching this and you're thinking uh I don't know what makes me special compared to another sales rep well then when you start agree to half the commission that normal sales reps get and then as you start hitting certain benchmarks have your commission structure go up to match basically what everyone else is getting at the company now the second way to make your first 100K is by flipping sneakers now this is a world that I am not too involved with but I have become a bit of an end consumer I usually dress like a grandpa on 90 of my wardrobe is Laura Piana zenya Brunello but one of the things that I do like are sneakers you know so a lot of times I'll throw on some Travis lows or maybe some dunks and you need to understand I'm going to be spending three to ten times the retail price of the shoe so this is a very lucrative world and if it's something that you can educate yourself on well then you can capitalize and it doesn't even need to be a pair of super hype pieces for example it could just be some New Balance 550s which I actually have a pair of and these shoes go for double retail so whether you have the right systems in place to actually get it at retail Market it correctly and make a 20 to 30 markup on eBay there's undeniably a lot of money to be made in the world of sneakers it reminds me a lot of the World of Watches which I know like the back of my hand I can't argue plus the benefit is that the stakes are a lot lower so mistakes are less expensive as well so look you will never see me flipping shoes like Benjamin kicks but I have seen with my own two eyes just how profitable it can be the next way to make your first hundred thousand online is with YouTube you know for all of you watching this I'd say only 10 of you have the it Factor needed to be successful on YouTube but even just the 10 watching you know let's say this video gets half a million views that's still 50 000 people who can start YouTube channels and go on to make their first 100K online with it so for those of you that have the ability attention really is the new currency I can't tell you just how life-changing creating a YouTube channel is and it's not too late either you know you can make great money on YouTube I personally make between 80 to 100 000 a month from AdSense and I've also been offered between 100 to 120 000 a month in sponsorships by an agency that represents the top talent in this Niche so you'll notice that I'm probably the only person in the space above 500 000 subscribers that talks about business finance that doesn't do sponsorships and that's because I like my freedom to be able to speak about you know how when people scam how climate change is all a hoax to control people even further tax them even further on just their day-to-day living I like the fact that I could talk about that stuff on my YouTube channel so for me I literally turned down 1.2 to 1.5 million dollars a year and that's at the current rate and we're growing super quickly so that will probably be 2 or three million dollars and I mean look who knows if I can still talk about that stuff and still get great sponsors I believe in then who knows maybe in the future I will so between AdSense and you know sponsorships if I wanted to take it I could be making 2.5 million dollars a year just from YouTube now bear in mind I am in the highest paying AdSense Niche so I get paid a lot of money for every single one of my videos I honestly think that not everyone is cut out for YouTube but it is a work in progress I mean I'm just gonna play a couple Clips right here from 2015 when I first started my YouTube channel guys I severely underestimate just how much time effort commitment goes into making YouTube videos I just want to talk about something that's been on my mind and that's disassociating yourself from negativity negative people as you saw in today's video I'm getting paid a good amount of money to run their branding so just remember you won't be great to start with but it's worth taking the first step the next way to make your first hundred thousand dollars online is by Drop Shipping so Drop Shipping is finding products online and basically marketing them through Facebook ads Google ads Tick Tock whatever it may be and then having a third party actually deliver the product so that way you're basically just the middleman so you make the margin and never have to deliver the product now that sounds amazing Until you realize that the gross margins are so small and then you're having to spend so much money on Advertising that by the end it's just not even worth it and yes for that reason I've never been a fan of Drop Shipping in the past because more people lose money from ads and they actually do succeed but the reason now I'm mentioning it is because with free  END"}
{"prompt":"The 7 Millionaire Skills I Wish I Knew At 18\n\n###\n\n","completion":" now listen to me your income and wealth is merely a reflection of your personal life and that's why if you want to be a millionaire you need to have the skills of a millionaire and that's precisely why in today's video i'm gonna take a time machine and go back and share with you the seven millionaire skills that i wish i knew when i was 18 years old now some of these millionaire skills i actually implemented and was one of the big reasons why i ended up making my first million dollars profit at the age of 18 but some of these i completely overlooked and the fact that you're watching this video i guarantee if you take the things that i implemented plus the additional skills that i didn't implement at the time i guarantee you'll probably go on to be even more successful than i was and that's why this is gonna be a very exciting video and if you are even remotely serious about your success you're going to want to watch the full thing the first millionaire skill that you need to learn and this one might really really shock you is stop watching the news now there are a few reasons for this the first one is you already have so much on your plate right like you've already got a big task in front of you which is you know becoming a millionaire you don't need all these additional extra inputs and stuff like that and quite frankly look there's nothing that's going on in the news that you're going to be able to affect change in this world as harsh as this sounds the only way that you can effect changes if you have money or you have an audience aka a platform but you don't have either of those things like you're just trying to you know before you can take care of other people and deal with world issues and this and that and by the way this is coming from someone who's built schools for over 2 000 kids in nepal you know like i do my part but i'm telling you i couldn't have done my part if you know when i was 16 or 17 years old i was consumed by the news and i'm like you know how can i affect change in the world like no i had to affect change in myself first and then once my life was abundant i could share that abundance for the world so that's number one it's like like anything on the news it's first of all not gonna affect your life like you know even when everyone argues about what president is and this and that like those do have some changes but like in your personal life for the goal of just trying to get to where you want to get to i can tell you has no difference so that's the main reasons you've got so much on your plate and you're not really going to be able to affect change out there in the world based on the news and the news isn't particularly going to affect you at your stage and lastly and you'll learn this as time goes on you can't trust the news i mean i feel as though like it's been very fun for me to watch the last three or four years for people to really i think start to come to our realization but even from the age of 12 years old i was super diligent that i specifically did not watch the news because i just knew it was one big conglomerate and that it was all owned by a very small subsection of people and that's why when i do try to learn about something i'm definitely not looking in the news so millionaire skill number one and by the way this is very funny because you know i got told growing up hey you know millionaires successful people they watch the news they stay informed and yeah maybe that may have applied in the 80s when there was sort of some sense of real journalistic integrity these days it's just not true at all right you will be substantially poorer if you do follow the news so that goes ahead and knocks off number one the next skill you need to learn is a high income skill now this is truly the basis of everything that you want in life and even better than that not learning one high income skills but learning multiple high income skills and stacking them together i mean you can almost imagine lego blocks the more of these high income skills that you can stack the more money that you'll make so when you're looking at something and you're deciding hey should i put my time and effort into this should i learn this skill ask yourself is this a high income skill is this a skill that will continue to pay me over the years you know a couple examples of high income skills is learning online marketing coding uh content creation sales millionaires have a high income skill that is valuable to the marketplace multi-millionaires have multiple high income skills that are valuable to the marketplace now i know that this is easier said than done and you might be stuck as to like hey where do i actually get started that's why earlier this year i literally locked myself in this room for four full days to get to the bottom of the question which is what is the best high income skill in order to make a hundred thousand dollars a year online now i actually evaluated all this by creating the money making matrix now what it does it evaluates all the best business models online and then it uses data and a very specific formula to assess truly what is the best business model in 2022 it's been one of my most popular youtube videos in the last year the comment section people absolutely love it so if you want to go check out that youtube video i will leave it in the first link in the description for your convenience anyways let's move on now skill number three is something that even multi-millionaires and billionaires struggle with to stay and the sooner you learn the skill the sooner you'll become a millionaire the next millionaire skill is learning to say no now this was something that i was amazing at growing up but kind of as i made my first few millions you know you get distractions and you get opportunities and this and you just you start to pile on a little bit more things in your life but it's so important to stay disciplined and say no to 99.9 of things because when the right things come up you want to make sure that you actually have the bandwidth and the space in order to go all in with those opportunities learning to say no is one of the best skills you could learn in your life and especially when you're first starting out it is so important learn to say no to your friends i want to go out and party learn to say no to favors you know you don't always have to do favors for people and also very importantly learn to say no to certain opportunities if you've already committed to one and you know that it's the right thing to get you to where you want to get to saying no is a way to have respect for yourself as well as what you're trying to accomplish and who you're trying to become in life now moving on everyone travels but it's a real skill to know how to travel and that's why millionaire skill number four is travel but travel less now traveling to put yourself in a new environment can actually be incredibly productive for you in fact i spent a large portion of my year in cape town to just kind of get away from the noise and it's a great place for me to sort of work and focus the key is i go there for two to three months when i actually go now you might be wondering iman why did you include this as the fourth millionaire skill and that's because i've seen something that really really trips people up and it's not when they first start it's when they make their first hundred thousand or two hundred thousand  END"}
{"prompt":"The 4 Reasons Why You’re Poor\n\n###\n\n","completion":" you know let's cut out all of the warm fuzzy self-help talk and I'm gonna be the first person to speak to you frankly today I'm going to tell you the four reasons why you're poor and reason number one is because you saw this title and it triggered you you listened to the first 10 or 20 seconds of this YouTube video and it's instantly triggered you and that says far more about you than anything else the first reason you're poor is because you can't look yourself in the mirror and be honest about your current situation you can't take criticism without even trying to protect your ego you know usually there's two things that most people can't take responsibility for it's number one how much money they have in their bank account and number two their weight and let me tell you something right now if you're watching this video it means that you have Wi-Fi as well as some sort of device that connects you to the global economy so for that reason you have no excuses zero none in the year 2022 if you still can't figure out how to make money shame on you now let me make a very very important caveat because there's a lot of people I know who don't make much money and they're genuinely happy they love their situation they love their life and I can see it in their their eyes you know you can you can tell a lot when you actually look someone in the eyes the eyes and you can tell are they saying this just to cope with their situation or do they truly mean what they say and they're like yeah like I make more than enough money I feel like I'm happy with my life and to those people I salute you and I don't believe it's in everyone's destiny to become a multi-millionaire but if you're watching this video right now it tells me everything I need to know which is you are not happy with your financial situation you know as I said I'm never bothered by a fat person who looks himself in the mirror and they're like hey you know what I get it you know maybe I could lose a little bit of weight maybe I could lower my body fat percentage but I'm fine with where I am you know my issue is when I see fat people explaining 101 different reasons why no no you don't understand it's my metabolism or it's this thing or there's this special reason why I'm different compared to everyone else out there and I know these people live in very sad existence because they have to look themselves in the mirror every single night and be okay with the fact that they lie to themselves the most important on Earth they lie to themselves and everyone has their flaws I'll give you a part for example all the time I drink I enjoy a drink you know sometimes I don't drink for a few weeks sometimes I drink every every single day in a week especially when I'm Up Abroad traveling with friends it is not good for me no one is going to try to pretend that drinking alcohol is good for me well at least when I'm drinking I'm not there making 101 excuses why I can't stop or why actually you know what maybe drinking is actually kind of good for you like no I just say hey I'm drinking I know it's bad for me I accept that it's bad for me and in this situation I have decided that the pros outweigh the cons but I've made this decision to drink on this particular day and I'm okay with it that is me being able to unemotionally assess my situation I've had many friends go hey I think you shouldn't smoke cigars they're not good for you and I'm like I understand there's Health implications but it's one of those things I just I'm gonna keep doing but the point is when someone gives me that sort of criticism or constructive criticism I can look at things objectively and I can assess the situation without getting triggered without feeling a person's attacking me without feeling that I'm a fundamentally a bad person or I'm flawed just look at things critically so the first reason you're poor is because you cannot look at your life critically without your little ego getting shattered and without feeling like you have to make 101 different excuses for the reason you're in the situation you're in right now now speaking of identity identity is kind of a funny thing in 2022 because I feel as though in the world right now everyone kind of accepts you can change your identity and you can shift your identity you know you could be a fan of one sport and the next year you know start getting a keen interest in another Sport and then now you identify as a fan of that sport you could be very into street style and identify as someone who dressed a little edgier and then the next year you change your identity to someone who dresses a little bit more on the classic side I mean look we're even in a situation where some people wake up on a Tuesday without changing anything about their physical appearance and decide you know what I am now the opposite gender I've done nothing to my body but I just identify as the opposite gender now so let's get this straight I can wake up tomorrow and I can identify as a girl change nothing about me and the woke liberals will give me a round of applause and go go you go you know empowerment but if I told someone hey you can wake up tomorrow tomorrow and stop identifying as poor start identifying as Rich they would crucify me so I said let's really unpack that the modern world believes that you know your gender that's an identity and you can just wake up and change that but your financial situation you know that's not you don't identify as poor all those people who who have no money they don't identify as poor how dare you it's just a very funny world we live in huh you need to understand that your financial situation is a hundred percent an identity now bear in mind 200 years ago I would not have said the same thing I mean really ever since 1840 or something like that when the Bible actually got translated from Latin into English you know basically ever since like the last 500-ish years information has started becoming democratized you know people can pick up books and they can start reading but the point is even let's say a hundred years ago it wasn't the way it is now the way it is now literally everyone watching this can log online and get the same information that someone else used to go on to make a million dollars 10 million dollars a hundred million dollars they have access to that exact same information yet they're stuck in the same place so you must ask yourself why and that's because you 100 identify as someone who is poor it is lodged very very very deep in your subconscious mind and by the way I know what that's like my first ever tattoo right here that I got at the age of 16. it says my cup runneth over which means I have more than I need the reason I got that was because my mom growing up she also used to tell me take as much as you can because you never know when you're gonna get any more that is the programming of someone who is poor and I love my mother to bits she's the reason I start my business she's the only reason I worked as hard as I did to get us out of our financial situation but until I got this tattoo on me until I got a reminder that I have more than I need I am abundant you know it's funny I got this tattoo literally maybe two months before my agency really started to take off and I was basically able to drop out of school support me and my mom so you need to understand that a lot of these things that are in your subconscious mind can be programming  END"}
{"prompt":"I'm Broke... What Should I do?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so look you are broke and quite frankly that's okay as long as you make the conscious decision to change your life's circumstance or go back to eating Cheetos and playing fortnite honestly up to you but if you're watching this video I want to actually congratulate you because you took the first step and the first step is acknowledging that you are not where you want to be and accepting the fact that it is in your power to change that so if you watch the entirety of this video I'm going to show you exactly how to assess your current situation look at your strengths your weaknesses and how to use that to your advantage to go from broke to financially flourishing now the first thing you need to do is honestly assess your assets and I'm not talking about your real estate portfolio or your stock portfolio or your crypto I'm talking about the advantages that you have sort of the intangible assets that you have in your life you need to understand in this world you get paid in accordance to the value or problems that you solve everyone has competitive advantages some are natural born and some are cultivated you need to lean into your advantages and funnily enough if you live at home in your mom's basement you still actually have an advantage and I'll tell you what that is in just a second now one advantage and as everyone understands the more money you have the more money you can make with said money well that's out of the window as per the title you're broke so that's not an advantage that you have so what are some of the other assets that you can lean on well the first one is hard work it kind of annoys me because sometimes you get a lot of these self-help people you know they talk about hard work as if everyone is hard working or it's just like this easy thing it's like oh yeah you just work hard and you'll be successful yeah sure but the reason we admire people who are hard working is because it's not a very common trait and most people are not going to possess that trait and I'll be honest I'm not particularly the hardest working person I just have other personality traits that I really leaned into that propelled me to my level of success now bear in mind from the age of 14 to 18 19 even 20 hard work was the main thing that I leaned on still I would not consider myself the hardest worker in the room by no stretch of the imagination but I earned my stripes and that is the key all of you watching this need to earn your stripes hard work dedication and discipline is very very important you know there's no way that you get around that to reach your goal of six figures whereas this may sound really weird to you guys but you can go from seven to eight figures while working a lot less hard being more sloppy with your habits less discipline all these things because you're actually leaning on different mechanisms to go from that stage to the next another thing that I want to mention is for me when I started nearly this you know 10-year Journey back in 2014 when I started my first business which was flipping Instagram accounts when I started reading a book a week and I started meditating every single day I think back then it was a lot easier to focus than it is in the world we live in right now with short form content and Tick Tock and all of these distractions that you know it feels like every year there's just more and more distractions so if innately if you are one of those people who just happens to be in extremely hard worker a person who can really lock in on a task without getting distracted that is a massive advantage and that is something that most people do not possess in the time that we live in but as I said you do not need to be David Goggins you know how it is when you fight somebody and you broke that much he's like oh God man I don't want to go back the next round and you feel like my God I can fight all day and I think of all the different assets that that I want you to evaluate in your life that I'm going to show you then you can actually make a game plan for which vehicle am I going to use to get me to financial abundance so as I said hard work discipline is a given but don't think that being the hardest worker is the thing that's really going to propel you to success of the four I'd say it's probably third most important maybe even fourth most important now the next asset that you can have is your skill set but the issue is that most people major in minor things I'll give you a perfect example video games I know that the gamers I get so much backlash from people you know when they tell me oh but you don't understand gaming helps me socialize or there's people who make millions of gaming and I'm like yeah you know the people who make millions from gaming they're not you you know why because the people making millions from gaming they're not commenting on my YouTube videos being like no but there's people out there who make millions from gaming and I'm like that's cool but they're not you quite clearly so I don't know why you're trying to stand up for it and that is a perfect example of people majoring in minor things great you finished can you even finish fortnite like you completed a fortnight or you completed some video game or I don't know you got some ranking in some World cool great you majored in a minor thing something that is irrelevant to the quality of your life something that is irrelevant to building a beautiful future for you and your family you majored in something so minor that your kid will never be like oh Dad Mom told me that you were so good I had Call of Duty back in the day you know that makes me so proud that you're my they don't care so stop majoring in minor things and by the way it is so important to have hobbies I recently started taking tennis classes multiple times a week am I going to become a professional tennis player no but I have my businesses I have my skill sets to make me lots and lots many many many millions a year and now I have my side Hobby and by the way I think if I started gaming now because a lot of people will give me the Elon Musk example Elon Musk is allowed to game he's allowed to game a little to take his mind off it I don't think it's necessarily the smartest thing to do because it's so easy to get hooked but if he does it or let's say I started gaming sure fine that's acceptable as I said do not get consumed by something that is not going to get you paid if you already don't have anything in your life that does get you paid by far above anything the best asset that you can have in life is your skill set because no matter what life throws at you let's say use everything if you have your skill set you can climb back up to the top of the mountain very very quickly so there are certain skills that are very useful for the rest of your life no matter what you are doing things like sales marketing even things like Excel spreadsheets I cannot tell you the amount of people that I know who are like hey who do you use for Excel spreadsheets or you know how did you put the spreadsheet together I don't know how to use Excel spreadsheet but people in my company who are paid very very handsomely they do know how to use it things like that things like accounting  END"}
{"prompt":"2023 Recession: How To Get Rich\n\n###\n\n","completion":" so look there's really no point in me making another video on just how insane of an opportunity you have during this 2022 to 2023 recession without me going into the details of how to actually execute on it so in this video i'm gonna lay out the three-step framework that you need to implement over the space the next three years to basically set yourself up for life now i wanna make something very clear this framework is not easy nothing good in life comes easy let alone generational wealth but this framework is incredibly simple and unfortunately a lot of times when something is so simple people think this can't be the answer this can't be the solution well i have a news flash for you it is now there are some nuances and there are some details where if you miss out this three-step framework and this three-step plan will not work for you and there are some specific details that you need to make sure you stay around for so grab a coffee grab a pen and paper and with no further ado let's get into it now step number one and i cannot believe i'm actually saying this step number one is i need you to save more now any of you guys who know me know that in general i have a disdain for frugal people i have a stain for over savers the people who are like you know what here's how i'm gonna become a millionaire i'm gonna penny pinch and i'm gonna save and i'm not gonna buy that five dollar coffee it's just so ridiculous it's so preposterous and really the only people that that applies to this is gonna be offensive but i don't care it's just the truth it's for the people who don't believe that they are worthy enough of making more money so if you can't make more money then you're like well i can't make any more money so the only option i have is is save money and if i save and invest my way on a 35 000 a year income maybe after 30 years i can be a millionaire i genuinely believe that people that try to save on their five dollar coffee or think that in an economy it's not worth paying the extra 70 for extra leg room on a seven hour flight i genuinely believe that those people have a mental illness and that mental illness is scarcity and if you have a scarcity mindset that's going to permeate into everything that you do you're basically like repelling money so as i said just understand that excessive saving you know basically getting into the frugal territory i just think it's for people who are just lame honestly like i see some of these people who make millions of dollars a year and it's like what do you want to do like take all that money to grade with you like i mean just spend it all you definitely shouldn't be giving it to your kids and most definitely you should not be giving it to your son people need to and especially men need to go hunt they need to work they need to actually earn what they claim anyways a little bit of a side tangent now you might be hearing all this stuff and might be going well oh man you're just reckless you blow all your money actually i'm probably one of the biggest savers or investors you probably know i personally save and invest or save for the purpose of in future when prices are better investing 80 of my income so i'm a big fan of saving and investing in your 20s and your 30s but what i'm a fan of is making excessive money so that way you have the ability to save and invest without compromising on the sort of life that you want but for the first time ever i am actually kind of in favor of saving and i'll explain to you why it's because right now i'm looking at things and i'm looking at the fact that in the next year or so and in some asset classes that's already the case you're going to have the ability to buy things for a 50 discount i mean if you look at the crypto markets you got 70 discounts from you know where they were six months ago if you look at the watch market once again from three four months ago you're getting a 25 30 sometimes even 40 reduction from what it was you know just a few months ago and although real estate prices at the moment are still very high i can guarantee you in a year from now that will not be the case so now when i'm looking at the price of something a nice jacket from laurel or zenya you know six months ago i'd look at it and the price tag would be seven thousand dollars now i look at it i'm like that's twenty one thousand dollars because if i took that same amount of money within the space the next five to eight years that money will literally triple and honestly probably a lot shorter timeframe as well you know now when i chart our private jet rather than look at the price tag as thirty thousand dollars i look at it as ninety thousand dollars let's bring it back home to an example with you normally i would tell someone go spend your 150 a month on starbucks like don't try to save and squabble and all this stuff like you should be able to make more than an extra 150 a month like you should know that you have the ability to make extra few thousand dollars a month if you really put your mind to something whereas now you know if you're spending 150 a month on starbucks it's kind of a little bit more like 500 a month because if you just dollar cost average that into different asset classes whether it be crypto stocks you know whether that be saving up for the down payment on your first rental property you know whatever the case is you know for once during this 2022-2023 recession i can actually kind of see a use case for saving you know and no matter how much money you make whether you make thirty thousand dollars a year or three hundred thousand dollars a year three million a year or thirty million year whatever it is you know for once i'm actually starting to look at things and going you know it is actually probably good for you to have your saver cap on so step number one during this recession over the space the next two years i don't want you to deal with lifestyle creep as you make more money i don't want you spending more money you know you can do that in four or five years you know in the year 2027 when you look back at this period you're like wow this is the time when i bought assets at super cheap prices and you really set yourself up for the rest of your life and just a little caveat one of the best ways to actually save more money is get your living costs down now if you live in new york california if you live in paris london amsterdam whatever it can be very difficult to do that sometimes if you have the ability to be remote whether that be because of your job or you decide to start an online business whatever the case is i recommend places like cape town obviously i'm a little biased i have a 12 000 square foot sort of mega mansion there and the living costs are one-tenth of what they are here in dubai we've got places like medellin or even bali basically these places you can have an incredible incredible quality of life for much much cheaper than it would cost in other major cities so as i said if you are location independent definitely see if you can move out to some of these places for the next two years three years so that way you can get your living costs down and make more money and then basically invest all that difference now speaking about making more money let's go to step two which is you need to increase your earning potential now before some of you guys roll your eyes  END"}
{"prompt":"5 Bad Habits Keeping Men Weak\n\n###\n\n","completion":" gentlemen I believe that from the moment you're born the odds are stacked against you I believe that in the modern world you are set up to fail we've got testosterone declining we've got men being shamed for being men really let that sink in for a second you are shamed for simply wanting to be a man and embrace masculine values and now you're villainized for being a man you're villainized for being what God set you on this Earth to be we're told that we're evil we're told that we're toxically masculine but quite frankly I don't think that we are I think we want to protect we want to provide and we want to fulfill our duty as a man I believe that as men we take great pride in the things that we can do for our sisters for our mother for our wife the issue is the modern world makes it very very difficult with all the traps that it lays out for us so in this video I'm going to tell you the five worst habits that keep men weak now the first one is extremely controversial and that is prescription drugs you're a little kid you have so much energy you have so much potential inside of you you could become so much be so much and you're not meant to sit in a classroom for six hours being static not moving that's not natural that's not right and we build all these unnatural structures and when a kid does not want to follow that system we label it as ADHD and then we numb them with Adderall you're feeling slightly depressed don't worry don't don't face the issue head on don't tackle it it's okay just you know take some ssris and be enslaved for the rest of your life because Prozac will fix all of your issues just take the pill don't question it how dare you question the science and by the way this is coming from someone who has had an extremely extremely difficult life this is coming from someone who went through an extremely difficult depressive episode in the summer of 2020 so much so to the point point that I even considered deleting myself and not thinking maybe I should do it once it gets scary is once you ask yourself how am I going to do it and you know what I did I consulted my most trusted advisors I consulted my most trusted masculine role models and I worked through it naturally I worked through it by completely cutting out alcohol completely cutting out stimulants like caffeine going through a process of an Elimination Diet and also doing a lot of meditation alone time trauma work just sitting with myself working through things but you know the modern world will tell you that that's stupid because you could have just taken a pill just like with sleep if you're having a difficult time sleeping don't bother to try to address the underlying health issues just just take a Xanax ladies and gentlemen they built the jail cell and you walked straight into it and unfortunately the worst and saddest thing to see about this whole situation is most of the time it's not even these kids or these teenagers fault most of the time it's the fault of the parents because they do not educate themselves on what these teenagers these kids are going through and then they pretty much enslave their children for the rest of their life because they teach them from a young age if you have a problem don't worry about it prescription drugs will fix all of it ladies and gentlemen these big Pharma companies are not your friend and you must understand that and look I may not be a doctor but this is just my viewpoint I genuinely believe from the bottom of my heart that you must do everything in your power maybe not to get fully off your prescription meds but start weaning off of it as much as humanly possible I want you strong I want you awake I want you living and not being a half dead zombie slugging their way through life now the next habit that keeps men weak is prawn Instagram and only fans and of course prawn is the most aggressive and the worst version and the worst manifestation of this problem but then again you look at Instagram and it's pretty much halfway there at this point now let's of course some people do use Instagram for business but that's a very small minority you know it's a very small minority that actually creates on social media and uses Instagram for business purposes outside of that you need to understand that Instagram is the biggest dating app on Earth it is an endless cesspit of sexual images but then again at least it's nowhere near as bad as only fans at least it's nowhere near as bad as giving up your hard-earned money simping and lining the pockets of girls that will never even acknowledge Your Existence and here's the issue with and it sounds very crass beating your meat it signals to your body and your mind that you have accomplished something when quite frankly you have not you're not where you want to be you didn't go to the gym that day you didn't go out and Conquer your career you didn't do any of the things that traditionally you would have to do in order to get the reward of a sexual partner so please gentlemen I understand that it's very difficult with the modern world that we live in but stop giving away one of your most powerful for Life forces to just some random screen now the next Habit to keep men weak is current events and news and I'm telling you it is done deliberately they plant things and by the way it's usually around the same time that they are passing some Bill or some law that is Draconian that is tyrannical that is pushing the world in a worse Direction and just around that time they'll have some new celebrity drama or some new event something to keep you distracted anything for you to argue about us versus them and this sounds very very harsh but the worst part is they want you to believe that your opinion matters when quite frankly it doesn't because listen to me your wife still works when she doesn't want to your mother is in an old person's home rather than living in a massive mansion with you and the rest of your family and instead you want to spend all your life in energy talking about Russia versus Ukraine when you live in the west it has nothing to do with you shame on you listen to me very clearly this is going to be extremely harsh but you need to hear it the only way you can make a change in this world is through influence or money and if you have neither then shut the  __  up and save yourself first and once you save yourself then save your family and once you save your family save your friends and once you've done that save your community and if you have checked off all of those boxes then and only then you can hear about the current events in the news and actually make an impact but until you've done all of that stop arguing about useless stuff you will have no change no effect on if you want to stay poor keep watching the news news is propaganda and news is simply there to keep you arguing about the same old because quite frankly why do you care about Qatar and their laws your mother still works she's not retired she should be enjoying her last few decades on this Earth and instead you want to sit there and write stupid tweets about Qatar and all of these geopolitical issues shut the up shame on you King wake up you have real work to do and this applies to YouTube by the way if your YouTube subscription box or your recommended channels are all of these reaction channels and these hit piece channels that are perpetuating  END"}
{"prompt":"3 Books That Made Me A Millionaire At 21!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" ladies and gentlemen in today's video i'm going to reveal three books that have changed my life now reading as a whole has been such a massive contributing factor to why i've managed to get to the point where i'm at you know a multi-multi-millionaire at the age of 21 multiple successful businesses and i'm not going to toot my own horn any further but point is reading was massive for me you know i started reading a book a week from the age of 14 and carried that on so from 2014 2015 2016 and then midway around 2017 i kind of started slacking but yeah for three and a half years religiously i read a book a week so in today's video i'm going to share three books that have changed my life now this these are three books of dozens and dozens and dozens but i want to give you guys some ones that i know potentially you may not have heard or um just you know further than your standard think and grow rich how to win friends and influence people and then if you guys like this i'd be happy to make a five further books that changed my life for you know five you know or you know just say five books that changed my life you know and i'll kind of be a bolt onto this one and i'll go for some of the ones that you probably don't know because there are books um that i definitely wanted to put in here but that also maybe for some people are a little too esoteric you know things like the caballon with no further ado let's get started with the first book so one thing to bear in mind is some of these books i literally bought the physical copy just to have it for this video today because i read most of my stuff with a kindle first book is atomic habits james clear now i read this book end of 2019 and i had a few people recommend it to me and i was like guys i've read 15 to 20  __  habit books like i don't need another habit book had a form positive habit book in my life i was wrong you know out of all of the books pertaining to habit and discipline in my opinion this is the one that is uh really just the most punchy and at the end it's not about who thinks of a concept first it's for me who can explain the best and um that award in my opinion goes to james clear so really what this book will do for you is it will give you a good road map on how to first of all identify the habits that are going to bring the highest returns in your life and then once you've done that an actual game plan on how to integrate them because here's the thing i'll be honest a lot of books out there on habit and discipline and this and that they throw out these these throughout these studies right and it's just um it doesn't really do much uh for engaging you or really giving you some tangible advice on like okay how do you make this thing stick and i think the one thing that james clear did uh is that better than anyone else that i've seen is he's he shows you how to make something stick not just oh here's this weird framework and and here's why this study is more conclusive that it takes 21 days rather than 66 days for a habit to stick or like i think this book just kind of gets straight to the chase and it really helps you understand why you do what you do and i said it really just helps you make habits stick rather than it just being this um rather than you reading a you know almost dissertation on habits um without much on okay here's the or the brass tacks of how you implement this stuff so yeah that is book number one book number two is way of the superior man by david data and do not let the title off-put you and um even some of the females in my audience you know i have given this book to every yeah every single one of my ex-girlfriends uh and this is actually a fresh copy right here i have probably given this book away maybe 25 different times and here's the thing the stuff in this book may not entirely apply to you know a lot of males out there um you know it may have you know may have some affinity to your personality uh but for me this thing is like like if you want to understand me and more importantly if you know your girlfriend or mine and you want to understand me and sometimes it can be very hard to understand someone who's entrepreneurial and also you know not that you know everyone falls into the star sign and you know i didn't believe in star science for the longest time but um i have the i'm the epitome of a capricorn don't be rude are you kidding me right um so if you want to understand me this book is amazing right now i read this book for the first time when i was 14 and it you know what it did for me was is it kind of it kind of gave me permission to to live the way that like it kind of gave me permission to be me right because because the law stuff in here in terms of uh your purpose and kind of your path as a man in this world um and by the way is that a man can have the definition of manhood is so um there's so many different ways that you can go about it right but i guess the definition of masculine energy we should say right and also the dance between the masculine and the feminine um you know in some relationships uh you know in terms of masculine and feminine polarity you know the female is more masculine right in her essence and and the male is more feminine in his essence and there's nothing wrong with that right but me as someone who is obviously a man uh and then also someone who's very in terms of in terms of the spectrum very you know on the uh side of very masculine in his in his essence right because i said you know feminine and masculine energy is not the same it's it's nowhere near the same and they're both beautiful and they both dance with each other and usually that's where the best relationships come from is you know a very you know you know it doesn't really matter the gender of the person really is that there's a masculine and a feminine and the two kind of dance together so um yeah i read this book when i was 14 i was like oh wow wow so like i'm not weird right and even at the age of 14 like i was embodying a lot of stuff in here um so yeah this book is incredible it's one of those books you need to read again and again and again and um especially for you know the biggest issue that young men have right now in my opinion is mastering their sexual energy most guys don't know how to master their sexual energy you know most guys don't know how to transmute their sexual energy you know and i think if you look and a lot of authors have written about this why people usually get more career success in their late 30s you know even early 30s or especially in their 40s and 50s is because they have less sexual energy or that sexual energy isn't really you know channeled in the form of um i don't know how i say this but um i guess in a physical way um usually their energy and their focus you know as i said really goes away from um uh fornicating i once went 28 years without having sex i don't i don't know you get my drift and really that's when especially men have a chance to really focus on their careers um because as i said most men out there just don't know what to do with their sexual energy and that's you know that's very plain to see when porn is such a massive industry when you know guys unfortunately they think it's

Do This Instead\n\n###\n\n","completion":" follow your passion and you will never need to work another day in your life what an absolute load of this is generally one of the biggest lies told by self-help gurus out there and in this video I'm going to tell you the three reasons why following your passion will keep you poor now I want to clarify something really quickly LeBron James followed his passion Drake followed his passion Virgil ablo followed his passion look if you're an athlete an artist a designer of course Follow Your Passion but in all fairness these people don't even fully follow their passion they still have to dumb things down or conform to get the results that they want to put it simply they have to be practical about their craft in order to get the reach and results and sort of money that they want and that brings us to the first reason why following your passion will keep you poor and that is that successful people put practicality first it's funny whenever I Charter a jet for a flight I always ask the stewardess what the owner of the jet does for a living and let me tell you something they never say oh he started a fashion brand or he started a coffee shop they tell me they have boring businesses and things like waste management or that they started software company that helps mortgage brokers so let's really break this down the owner of the 30 million dollar jet the one that you put on your vision board the one that I have to Charter for fifty thousand dollars a flight because I can't afford to buy it myself he made his money in collecting people's garbage do you think that when he was eight years old he said you know what I want to be when I grow up I want to be a garbage waste removal entrepreneur a mover and Shaker a Titan in the waste management industry of course not so as I said the first reason of following your passion will keep you poor is because wealth is built through practicality not passion look I'm telling you right now the only way to really make money is by providing a service or a product that the market really needs or wants and let me tell you something the market does not give a sh do you want to start the 9 000th sustainable gym wear brand when you have 337 followers on Instagram you need to solve a problem and that's the only thing that should consume your mind when Building Wealth is how do I become a professional Problem Solver so when you solve a Market's problems either through products or Services you get paid so for this reason you need to detach from the feeling or the need that you need to only solve you know colorful problems and you know problems that are airy fairy and uh ladies and gentlemen when I was eight years old do you really think everyone went around the room and when you know I want to be an astronaut when I grow up I want to be a footballer and I said yeah so uh when I grow up I want to have an advertising agency and then from there I want to start an e-learning platform and then I want to start a software company for agency owners do you think I really said that at the age of eight years old no and by the way that also doesn't mean that I don't wake up and I'm excited to work my work is more meaningful to me than anything else on Earth but I'm not particularly passionate about it like I'll be honest I didn't start a software company for agency owners because I'm like I'm just gonna I'm Really Gonna Change the World no I saw a problem I saw a gap in the market and I knew quite frankly I could make multiple tens even multiples of hundreds of millions of dollars especially just because the way that software companies are valued as well as you know the way we set it up it's a very easily sellable business so yes you need to focus on being practical but you also need to focus on solve building problems in accordance to your skill set so look at first you might start an agency that helps people with organizing their Google Sheets or their Discord moderation and you do that for long enough you work on your skill set and then in 10 years you create a software that directly competes against Discord I mean as I said that's the path that I took with an agency you know when I first started as a creative agency doing photo video for clients posting on their Instagram and their Facebook and growing their social platforms back in 2016. I didn't imagine that that would then lead me to having an advertising agency and then from there really taking my wealth to the next level with a software company but as I said you need to solve problems in accordance to your skill set I didn't have the skill set in my first you know few years of Entrepreneurship to really start and grow a successful software company so ladies and Gentlemen please remember do not walk before you can crawl now I know at this point a lot of you guys are wondering okay well what sort of practical business can I start well earlier on this year I released my most popular video to date I basically evaluated the most common eight business models out there and then using formula math in an equation I came down to which one one's the best for which people in which scenario so many of you guys have sent me emails and messages saying that you've used one of the models that I evaluated in that video so I know you guys found a lot of value from it and I'll leave a link down below anyways the second reason why following your passion will keep you poor is because of emotions look emotions are a beautiful thing you should nurture emotions with your romantic partner you should experience emotions as you walk through life but in business emotions make you weak you need to look at things with logic you need to avoid having Rose tinted glasses when you are making business decisions so when you start a passion business emotions will be your biggest Achilles heel if you've ever spoken to someone who started a sort of passion business you'll notice that a lot of time they live in their own world they don't actually use logic they don't look at you know the market how the Market's responding to their product and this and that a lot of times they just throw their hands up and say ah people just don't get it they are too close to their baby which is their business which means they cannot adapt quick enough in my business I don't care I'll adapt I'll chop and change I'll look at things objectively and make decisions from there and this is a very common with successful people they are not married to the root they are just dead set on the Final Destination they want to get to now let me make something clear I still have very clear principles that I will follow I have a code of ethics that Will Never Be Shaken but as long as I don't break my you know code of ethics or code of honor which is what I refer to it as then I am willing to Pivot based on how the market is responding in life if you want to accomplish anything great you need to understand that emotions will be your biggest enemy there is a time and place for emotions but your career is not one of those places and that is why following your passion will trip you up eventually now the last reason and it's probably the most depressing out of all them is that once you start making money from your passion you actually don't really enjoy  END"}
{"prompt":"Easiest Way To Start Dropshipping From Scratch (Exactly What I Did)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" trying to start a dropshipping store can be overwhelming with so many different steps and strategies it's hard to even know where to start so in this video i'm going to share my exact strategy for starting a new drop shipping store from scratch and in the last couple months i've built a new store with this strategy and that store has already done close to 900 000 in sales so if i had to start over today this is exactly what i would do if you're new here my name is jordan and i'm currently documenting the entire process of growing my online business with as much transparency as possible so that i can lead by example and help you start your own online business this year so if you're interested in starting your own online store and you want to follow my journey make sure to subscribe for new videos every single friday all right let's get started firstly i want to show you some live results that i'm getting with this exact strategy so it's around halfway through the day and i've already generated around 3 800 in sales on this store the profit margin is pretty good as well i've done almost fifteen hundred dollars in profit which is almost a forty percent profit margin and if we take a look at yesterday's stats you can see i sold around sixty seven hundred dollars and made around eighteen hundred dollars in profit i just wanted to prove to you that this is working right now so you know it's worth your time to watch this whole video so there are four main things that go into building a successful drop shipping store the first one is your product the second one is your store the third is your marketing and how you get customers and the fourth is running your business and shipping out your orders now i'm gonna break down each of these one by one as simple as possible so let's get started with products so without a winning product it's pretty much impossible to have success with drop shipping thankfully there are a ton of products out there that you can sell every single week new winning products pop up so the opportunities are always fresh there's really only three things that i look for when determining if a product is a winning product the first thing is if the product has been recently trending on facebook and instagram what i mean by trending is that there is a ad that is getting a ton of views shares comments and likes and people are going crazy for the product this is a great sign that you can make money off of this product because people are already interested in it as long as you do something a little bit better than the person that's already selling it you can swoop right in compete with them and make money selling that same product this is exactly what i've done for every single one of my winning products and it's worked time and time again the next thing i look for is mass appeal my favorite type of products are the ones that can be sold to the masses i don't love the extremely narrowed down products that only apply to a small set of people yes they will buy the product but if we ever want to scale and build something big we need something that we can sell to almost everybody it's okay if it's a little narrow like it's only for women or it's only for men but the broader the better the last thing i look for is good profit margins what i consider to be good profit margins is being able to sell the product for three times the cost it takes to ship it out to the customer so if the product costs you around 10 to send it to your customer you want to be able to sell it for at least 30 and that's pretty much all i look for in a winning product let me show you a live example of exactly what i'm talking about okay so this product is an absolute banger basically it is a garden privacy fence that you set up in your backyard as you can see this product was launched on march 8th of this year and they've already got over 70 000 likes on this post if you check out the comments people are going crazy for this they love it they really enjoy the product but the people that are selling it aren't doing a good job and if we look at their video it's not really that good and then if we go to their website it's the same thing it's really not that good this product has great profit margins as well you can see that it cost around four dollars on the low end to ship to a customer and they're selling it for anywhere from 1999 all the way up to almost a hundred dollars per sale so if you came in and made a slightly better video a slightly better website you could clean up off of this product and make a ton of money so like i said that product is an absolute banger and a perfect example of a winning product now how do you find these products the tried and true method that i've been using for years is simply just looking on your facebook and instagram feed every single day you're going to get targeted with ads for drop shipping products eventually and every time you get targeted with one of these ads you need to show facebook that you're interested so you want to go to the ad you want to like you want to comment you want to go to the website you want to click add to cart and show facebook that you're trying to buy stuff like this so they will start recommending you more products and your feed is just going to become the best product research tool that you have that's my favorite method but i also created a tool that automates this process so if you want to check that out click the link down below alright so step number one is finding a product that fits this criteria so once you've got that product now you've got to build a store now there are a couple different types of stores that you could build you could build a general store which is a store that has a bunch of random products all around it you could build a one product store which is a store that only focuses on selling one main product or you can build a hybrid store which is what i recommend building a hybrid store combines the benefit of a one product store and a general store with a general store you have freedom to test a bunch of products and with a one product store you're limited but you're gonna have a higher conversion rate and people are gonna trust you much more than a general store with a hybrid store you're creating the same branded feel that a one product store would have but with the freedom to test a bunch of products i think it's better if i just show you an example so this is a sample store that i created that would actually be perfect for the product i just showed you the store is called flora flow as you can see it's pretty much focused entirely on home and garden based products it has a nice branded design it has a good logo it's easy to browse and shop around and overall it feels like a trustworthy site i recently made a video on exactly how i built this store so after you watch this one feel free to check that out the one tip i will give in this video is to model your store off of what's already working this is not some brand new design i came up with i just put my own little twist on what was already working you don't have to reinvent the wheel you just have to take what's working and add a little bit of your own sauce to it so i would advise taking your product building a store like this and filling it up with  END"}

in any shops   not in the stock exchange listen you're probably  gonna be happier doing that yeah yeah because i'm   wearing it every day yeah and you look good too  oh thank you see you later how does this crash   like look compared to what you've seen in the  past the way the people acting everything how   different does it seem that's a good question i  think in the past two crises covet and financial   uh crisis uh there was a lot the government  could do to really help with a rapid recovery   it's a different circumstance this time  over time the markets have always gone up   and just have confidence that things will recover  as the afternoon was approaching people were   getting less interested in talking to me and after  being rejected over a hundred times i had truly   reached my breaking point that might have been the  coldest rejection i got so far and even though it   was painful it was actually great talking to  all these people but i was looking for a real   wall street legend and for that there was only  one place i could go you know well you know we   got all dressed up and everything to try to come  into the stock exchange is it possible to go in   there for a video real quick um unfortunately  this hasn't been open to the floor since   9 11 no worries thank you man i really wanted to  go inside so i decided to make a few phone calls   to see what i could do unfortunately i wasn't  having any luck and then i called my boy sam yo what up bro we here in the city  right now we're on wall street   trying to get into the stock  exchange you're there right it looks like you're in the  city right now can you come here all right bro we'll see you in a couple minutes  thank you our last hope that's good good yes sir   so look i have to make a call see what  i can do it usually needs clearance   so i do have one person that usually lets  me into this place i've been there before   uh super cool experience let me make a call  no promises but let me see what i can do okay   all right bro try your best all right you  gotta thank you give me a second all right let's see if the boy sam can come through for  us this is really our last hope so let's see okay cool i'm with them now and then um i'll  head over there in a second okay all right cool   okay got some cool news for you what's up  so a few months ago i met with this guy   and i want to make sure you guys get hooked  up inside the stock market machine where you   saved the day man thank you hey let's go  over there maybe should i take you there   yeah all right cool i have a meeting in like  20 minutes so i'll take you there real quick   and then you guys do whatever you want  but i gotta run after that okay let's go   how are you investing during these times  what do you think about the crash overall   so obviously the market's not where it was before  so we shouldn't be looking at the prices i think   we will be falling for the next few months but i  will be looking at the great companies like tesla   amazon nvidia all the companies that in five years  from now will still be rocketing to all-time highs   and slowly averaging down however not overdoing  myself averaging slowly to extent where i don't   feel overextended inside the market this is it  man this is where it all happened so he's gonna   be in about five minutes he just confirmed it with  me um he's gonna take you to that entrance right   over there they're gonna clear through security  once you're in you can go straight inside take   all the content you need thanks again bro got  it brother all right peace out gotta run see ya i'm not gonna lie at this point i thought we  were good i mean we had secured an interview   with a big dog on wall street but unfortunately  i legally can't say if we went in there or not   even if we literally did get invited to  go inside which i'm not saying we did   a week after i got home i was told i am not  allowed to use any of the footage at first   i was gonna scrap this whole video i'm  just like sad i'm like super bummed like   yeah we'll figure something out but we came such  a long way i couldn't go out like that so instead   of throwing this whole interview away i had an  idea so first off how long have you been coming   to the stock machine i came here in 1985. got you  and you've seen a lot since then a lot of crashes   a lot of recessions how does this current dip in  the market relate to those do you see a similarity   or it's way different i've seen the crash of 87  the bubble of 2000 the financial crisis of 07.   you know the crazy years under professor orange  over there and then i've seen uh kobe crack   i think this has components to it that i can  describe that i've never seen before no one's   ever really had a health crisis this way before  the economies of the world were shut down to zero   the airline restaurant  END"}
{"prompt":"I Asked Bitcoin Billionaires For Crypto Advice\n\n###\n\n","completion":" today we're here at the largest bitcoin conference in the entire world inside of here are some of the most successful investors athletes and celebrities of all time today i'm going to be asking them one question what's the best way to make money with crypto the only problem was we had no way to get to them we got to figure out how to sneak backstage and get to the real people i don't know how we're going to do it we're going to join this community then my friend and i scattered out the entire venue looking for any type of way to get backstage a few minutes later we found this we just found this definitely not supposed to be up here but it's going to take us backstage all right joe we snuck backstage at the bitcoin conference we're here in the press room and i think we actually might get some good interviews today so i'm nervous my heart's beating but man i'm excited let's get it i pretty much walked through the back door and made myself at home enjoyed some free coffee and pretty quickly recognize someone that's kevin o'leary he sold his business for 3.7 billion dollars and he's on that one tv show you might have seen i asked him to do the interview and with no hesitation he said sure i'm gonna go right now we're here with kevin o'leary big fan of this guy i've learned a lot from you my question to you is for a beginner what would you say is the best way to make money with crypto you know to start small um crypto requires a little education and i think everybody doesn't matter who you are should basically get a centralized and decentralized wallet so you understand what the difference is and then put in 200 bucks and you'll lose it that's what's going to happen but you'll you'll figure out who hacked you why they hacked you uh what you did wrong about security everybody loses money in the beginning and then you start to understand how important it is to understand what what these how these wallets work but start with the basics i'd suggest work with five coins and you definitely want some ethereum you're gonna need it yeah definitely um and you want some bitcoin the granddaddy of it all but also check out solana look at polygon you know look look at some other ideas and just start to work with them move them between your centralized and decentralized wallet understand how that works there's so many great resources like you online that you can learn from and if you go to youtube it's just countless lessons yeah that's what i did i did that three years ago and i started to really get down the rabbit hole i feel i'm learning every day continually but i've got a ton of money invested yeah and i'm you know i mark to market it every day and the volatility is you know nosebleed but that's the nature of where we're at in the cycle yeah well thank you kevin i really appreciate it man have a great day thanks okay bye everybody that is the face of accomplishment i was feeling great after the press room so we decided to go explore the rest of the conference and i saw the challenge of a lifetime if i could stay on the bull for two minutes i would win a free bitcoin which is like 40 000 and i was feeling like i got that all day i walked up there ready to claim my throne as the king of the bitcoin bull but unfortunately i only lasted about 24 seconds and these guys laughed at me so to get my revenge i needed another great interview asap we explored the conference for about an hour couldn't find anybody but then i ran into an old friend of mine brian john he's a highly successful investor and has one of the largest crypto channels on youtube here's what he had to say brian my question to you for beginners what is the best way to get started and make some money with crypto if you're a beginner when it comes to crypto don't be afraid to make mistakes i know a lot of people get intimidated by investing and they see stable coins bitcoins all coins she but you know millionaires there's just a lot going on but what i'm gonna say is don't be afraid to slip up the best investors make mistakes but all you have to do is make sure you do this one thing right here you want to learn from your mistakes if you make 100 mistakes if you don't learn from them you're not going to get anywhere make your mistake make note of it learn from it move on and be a better investor well said bro thank you it was great catching up with brian and he shared some amazing advice but i was on a mission to meet one man today this man is michael saylor he's the owner of microstrategy which holds more bitcoin than any other public company in the world as of today his company is estimated to have almost 125 000 bitcoin which is worth around 5.2 billion dollars but i couldn't find this man anyway so right now we are not really doing that well i haven't really talked to anybody in the last like two hours and we're running out of time here so i searched the entire place did a podcast and even met up with some subscribers as we were ready to give up though i noticed something when we were walking through the hallway we just saw michael sailor go in that room over there and i think we're gonna get him on the video no joke i literally waited outside this man's room for over an hour but after a while the waiting paid off because he came outside and i had to shoot my shot and i wanted to ask you one quick question 30 seconds for this video if you don't mind thank you so much okay are you jordan yes sir okay nice to meet you by the way i'm gonna make fun of yours so uh all right guys you can do it inside if you want that would be great maybe let's do it i mean i only got five minutes maybe one minute we'll be less than one minute i knew it would probably be more than one minute but you got to do what you got to do all right we're here with michael saylor one of my biggest inspirations in this crypto world and i have one question for you so i saw today that you're more bullish than ever on bitcoin what do you see for the future of cryptocurrency and for beginners how can they get started in this world i think you're gonna see um crypto technology built into lots of more mobile apps and you're gonna see an explosion in digital wallets that are holding bitcoin and also stable coins and increasingly as lightning rolls out you're going to see websites and mobile apps build the protocol into all their offerings so that people can move money around at the speed of light cross-border everywhere right making it more accessible for everybody yeah i think there's an explosion and and accessibility to money and i think also the people are getting frustrated there are billions of people who can't get a bank account and there are billions of people that want to move money on saturday and there are billions people that want to move money between africa and south america and asia and the us and you know if i go to my pay app and i click send you know i get rejected a third of the time myself even if i'm trying to send it to someone here in the united states so so i think that most of the world is thinking it ought to be fast and easy and ubiquitous and crypto technology lets me do it and 20th century technology doesn't and lastly for the beginners out there who are just getting into this world smaller budget maybe what could you say for them i think the first thing to do is educate yourself if you go to hope.com there's lots of free education uh my website called sailor.org  END"}

share how much I make in the video yeah yeah tell us maybe and then dude I love you I love this guy on to the next person what did it take for you to start making your first dollars on YouTube I just put in a few words like more than I had I was really broke I moved to LA from Florida I got two credit cards open I maxed them out on the way to LA in a U-Haul and while I was in Texas I ran out of money opened a third credit card on the phone and maxed that one out by the time I got to L.A entire year I'm living out in La making videos with Eric now in debt in debt at this point what has been your best month in earnings from YouTube oh man nothing too crazy I think like like 40 000. why and from where you started so now it hasn't been too long so congrats seriously it's absolutely crazy you guys all right you're crushing it how long did it take you to make your first dollar on YouTube so I started making YouTube videos in 2008 like a music channel 2008. wow I'm doing music covers I made 150 bucks I think within like a couple years from that and then I didn't make anything until 2020. what is the most you've actually earned in a month from your YouTube channel um I think earlier this year we did 245 000 and with how many subscribers uh I have 800 000 now so around 700 000. oh congrats you bro it's one of the biggest numbers of the day and you don't even have a million Subs so it shows that you can make good money on YouTube without having a crazy big Channel hey look so my question for you is what was the first dollar you made from YouTube and when was it oh it was in 2012 but I made like 40 bucks awesome I'm super happy you've been on YouTube for 10 years or more now yes what's the best month that you've had with your Channel uh the best month I think I did a meal once wow yeah yeah that was that was very nice oh that's our man I think my little brother watches every single one of his videos nice to meet you I'm Jordan I learned about the interview for like 30 seconds do you remember when you made your first dollar from YouTube yeah I do and it was only about a Dollar too is the thing that was about like two two and a half years ago so it hasn't even been that long I was probably posting videos for like a year or two years before I made a single dollar off of YouTube but everything I did was more so just for the impact and not making money so that was motivating me to just keep going regardless of what was coming in what's the most you've ever spent on one single video oh my gosh uh probably 250k yeah 250 to inspire the kids is amazing man yeah what's the biggest month you've ever had in earnings from YouTube I'll just say our biggest month in earnings is still ahead of us but it allows us to support you know about 200 000 square feet of Burbank Studio space which is not you've got about 125 employees we've got multiple brands that we're launching you know to all the parents that have said you can't build a real career off YouTube I think there's a lot of people in this room that are proving that wrong the day was going amazing I met up with some friends I made some new ones and even took an Ellen arm wrestling on camera but I still had some people I wanted to talk to so I made some phone calls and secured an interview with one of my favorite YouTubers in the world we just secured something crazy with Mr Trahan Mr six foot three I am doing I'm so good how are you doing Jordan I'm doing great man so look how long did it take you to make your first dollar or should I say first penny from YouTube uh I remember this vividly like as soon as I got monetized and I saw an actual Penny yeah like on my Creator Studio I started freaking out but I think the memory I actually have is when I hit 15 because I refreshed one day and I had a video going kind of viral yeah and I was like wow that's 15 bucks that's like two hours in Texas a minimum wage work I was like this is gonna be insane I mean you're known for your video that didn't cost that much money but I'm curious what's the most that you've actually spent on a video okay so a lot of people don't know this I'd talk about it when I went to the world's loneliest house

{"prompt":"Meet The Youngest Amazon Millionaire\n\n###\n\n","completion":" this is kenzo he's become a multi-millionaire at 19 selling products on amazon you're making 200 a month this listing i'm pretty sure gross is about 550 thousand dollars a month private porsche gt3 rs a porsche cayman s sl 65 i have a ferrari f12 berlinetta so i flew across the country to his office to see exactly how he got to this level all right guys so we made it to kz international yes man tell us a little bit about where we're at right now what's going on right now we're at our headquarters in huntington beach we got three units out of this building and basically this is where it's our one-stop shop right we do our sourcing we do our selling we store our products we prep our products we forward it to amazon we manage our amazon storefronts here the whole nine yards so essentially the business model that we follow when it comes into regards of selling on amazon is wholesale fba right so if you look at some of the products that we actually have here you'll see a bunch of different name brand products that you'll see in your basic big box stores like target walmart costco all these brands already spend the millions and millions of dollars per annum on the marketing the advertisements and whatnot and all we need to do is source the product for a cheaper price and end up selling it for a higher retail price so that what this allows us to do is not run any ads on any of our products they're all naturally in demand so literally it's a plug and play business as long as you could source something for a cheaper price and sell it for a higher price that's where your margin is made and no complications you're not looking for the next big thing you're looking for the stuff that already people are shopping for already are buying and just figuring out how to source it for lower and sell for exactly yeah so basically i i tried private label i tried building my own brand a few years back and for me it totally flopped not saying that if i tried it now it wouldn't perform but basically this business model just makes sense it's one of the oldest businesses out there i low sell high retail consumer goods i kind of want to look and go inside and see how this all operates maybe you can explain a little bit about how this all works yeah let's do it let's do it basically everything on this side of the section of the warehouse is basically ready to go out so it's all already labeled with amazon labels so basically when amazon freight pulls up we just take it off the shelves or take it on the aisle and load it up straight to the truck so on average we average about 75 to 100 pilots sending out two amazon fulfillment centers per week yeah um so there's somebody watching this right they're seeing kenzo got the warehouse you got all this setup there's no way you started with a warehouse where were you holding this stuff before bro uh so at first when i first started i just had my supplier send my products directly into an amazon fulfillment center because with fba amazon pick packs ships your products stores them whole nine yards so i was able to leverage his facility at first but the thing is when you have someone else and all these different variables moving around it's hard at quality control so then i started picking up products myself so i used to drive a pickup truck down here to la because that's where my vendor was i'd load up the pallets into the flatbed and i drive back up north and i was throwing it like on the side yard of my house and my mom my mom was always so mad at me yeah so you had like stacks and stacks of boxes inside of your house but it would only be like two pallets at a time so it wasn't anything too too crazy i actually have a few videos to be prepping it like yeah we'll throw some of those up on the screen some of my college classmates back then but uh yeah no it hasn't always been like this and then after a little while i got my first warehouse down here in la when i moved down here uh it was really small like 2 000 square foot um and yeah we just been growing ever since but is this your only warehouse that you have right now no so basically so we have three units out here in huntington beach we have a warehouse in miami a warehouse in houston and then new jersey is going to be open in november jersey is probably going to be one of the biggest ones that one's up so i'm super excited all right so we're going to take a look at some of the products now but what's the first product you started selling like how did you even get into all this you know so the first product i actually sold when i got into wholesale fba was sharpie markers so i spent 7 500 which was literally everything i had to my name from drop shipping on ebay and i bought two pilots of sharpie markers i drove down to la picked them up brought them back up to norcal and i flipped those i did like 25 paying revenue the fees were a little high so i probably only profited like four thousand dollars on it but 4k off of 7 500 investment and i sold out within like a month because it was like back to school time about three years ago i mean so that was sort of when it clicked for you like this is what i'm gonna do yeah that's when when everything started making sense like that's my first like oh i made an investment i made a return everything went smoothly i was like okay i'm ready to i'm ready to go full force with this got you so so now i mean let's look at some of the biggest products you got going on i mean we see a lot of monitors as you were saying a lot of electronics i mean we could start here i mean we i mean it's it's nothing too too crazy but the the little items like this like some literally lip balm yeah these are the things if you have let's say this listing is making twenty thousand dollars a month okay you have ten of these different products like this you're making 200 a month so basically anything from daily products like that people are always going to have chocolates who are always going to need stuff like that to i mean look at this that's the most random stuff ever we have some the vegan chew soup you know i got that for jordan i need one of these on the way out so the main thing we really do focus on electronics these are like handheld vacuums uh from black and decker how much would something like this bring you so this listing i'm pretty sure gross is about 550 000 a month now it doesn't mean we're actually producing the whole 550 000 that's just the listing on amazon so if you actually have the inventory to back it and you maintain buy box you could go ahead and do that but in reality i probably have like half a month's worth of stock so in reality only i'm only going to do maybe like 200 250k revenue from right but that's just from this one product you've got all these other products as well you have a bunch of different products in here so that's the thing it's about diversifying your portfolio making sure you're well-rounded but it all starts with that one first product it all starts with that one product right for the people watching they might look at you and see this and think this is not possible for them is this a business that anybody could get involved with yeah honestly that's what i love about this it's a business that you're able to really plug

it's fully like based on stocks or crypto just crypto we don't do any stocks wow so with the crypto market right now like what are your thoughts on it i think most people that get into the market only see it as a money grab mostly but there is a technical innovation happening where essentially most monetary value will be transmitted over these networks if you look at 2013 then 2017 and then now people who actually make it stick through the bear market this is just a short term temporary dip i don't see like a massive beer market happening it'll be relatively quiet for a while there'll be different sectors within krypto that'll pop off really hard but i'm pretty confident in the industry that so you and your clients are buying the dip of course yeah and you know for somebody that wants to do the ecom side of things like what would you say about that uh be very specific with your metrics test as much as you can yeah but don't rely on one cent END"}

actually moved to dubai nine months ago yeah so dubai is my base but i have a home in cape town uh and then obviously spend 75 days 90 days a year in london yeah what are you working on these days like what is a day-to-day work like for you basically the business i've had for the longest time is an advertising agency you know pretty simple stuff i've been running that since i was uh since i was 16 years old it was the reason i dropped out of high school from that three years later started a e-learning company specifically for agency owners with training with tools proprietary software et

check all the other ones nice that's that's pounds around like 10 000 yesterday so that's what did you do yesterday we went to the jazz club we hung out with arlen we just picked it up i didn't know not much to be honest or i'd say probably everything on all yesterday for the e-learning platform maybe like 15 000 at the agency which is a lot more lean uh yesterday we did not crazy 4 800 pounds um so yeah 4 800 pounds and still a five figure day across both businesses you know and that's not counting investments youtube yeah software come i mean software company i have a business partner i can't show the revenue on that all i will say is at the moment between all the companies that's around in dollars like 20 25 000 a day but i know you didn't start like that so you know i want to go now and talk a little bit more about the come up and really how you got started in this game because people need to know your story the boy iman said he's going to watch shopping today so let's see what he buys but it wasn't a regular shopping experience we went to a private room in the back of the rolex store that i'm not even supposed to show and it was the perfect place to talk about his comeback fill out the world's smallest violin yeah so i mean look i had a very funny upbringing where like my dad was alcoholic abusive so i never met him thank god my mom was brave enough to finally leave him before the time that i was around i was born in russia spent first four years there uh on my life and in that period my mom started dating my stepdad um you know my stepdad lived in london they tried living together and sort of they were together for like a year and a half so you kind of went from like a lower income situation of living in london having a nice place like your lifestyle switched up pretty yeah i mean i went from you know russia nine black and white channels to you know london 999 color channels yeah there's a magical story i moved to london i went to private school like my stepdad was wealthy uh and then it just went basically wrong iman's stepdad completely cut them off they went from wealth to welfare overnight government benefits right welfare in america but then i also had the uh context of like i was around you know rich kids at school so you knew it could be possible yeah for me it wasn't a big deal it was like i will 100 not be rich i'll be extremely wealthy yeah and i'm exactly where i knew i'd be i'm just 10 years ahead of schedule what did you do to start getting some money coming in i had a couple businesses between 14 16 you know learning skills myself and then you know selling those on yeah and then eventually i i landed on you know having a marketing agency when i was 16. sort of like 18 months into having that particular business you know that's when things took off that's when we started hitting you know 80k 100k months profit that was sort of like that you know takeoff year call now i'm going to keep it hold on i got to ask you like if you were starting over from scratch today 16 year old iman in 2022 how would you do it i mean look nothing 90 percent of it is the basics you know for me half of the game is just stop smoking pause stop drinking stop hanging out with the same friends that used to hang out with like business really is just a reflection of your personal life you can't have like a chaotic mind and have a you know a flourishing business so you got to fix everything that's in here first i was meditating i was exercising like i was like so so i've always been so picky with the friends i have people can't focus these days you know most people can't sit down at their desk and just focus for one hour and if that's too daunting for you then like cool you're never going to build anything yeah definitely agency is the best business model because it's service based and service base is the real key right like i think it's in this world it's so easy to make even five thousand dollars a month right now as a personal trainer yeah seven thousand dollars as a piano coach if you really know how to do it right all of it isn't so much about what you're doing it's about who you're selling to and the way you position the offer and if you understand those things and you just get a little bit of coaching and a little bit guidance on that stuff yeah it doesn't matter what service based industry you get into i would fully agree with that bro i mean even though i talk about ecom and drop shipping the service based businesses are the lowest barrier of entry for most people and they typically have the best margins too so the margins are incredible completely agreed yeah out here having some tea time cheers my brother british experience i could have given you yes sir very authentic london experience going from that first seven figures that first million to the eight figure level what did that take um you have two options either you grow your company and then you sell it and you have to structure your company correctly in order for that to be the case and that's basically the play with my software company or have a cash flow business and then all the way up until eight figures uh invest in medium to high risk uh investment portfolio spend 20 percent of everything you make yes the rest the 80 just invest sure you can invest in s p 500 i mean that's cute i'm  END"}
{"prompt":"Exposing The Truth About Shopify Dropshipping..\n\n###\n\n","completion":" i'm gonna be honest with you drop shipping is not as great as people make it out to be now don't get me wrong hit is a great way to start making money online and it has changed my life in so many ways but the business model is just not sustainable in the long term but by approaching this business in a slightly different way in the last few years i've generated multiple seven figures and as you can see this year i'm on track to do over two million dollars in sales without drop shipping so in this video i'm gonna be exposing the raw truth about drop shipping and why i moved on my exact approach that's generating me over a hundred thousand dollars a month consistently and we're even going to be talking to one of my friends who has built an empire on shopify with multiple brands worth over 250 million dollars to get his opinion on this so let's break down the three biggest problems with traditional drop shipping this first problem is the main reason why drop shipping stores don't succeed in the long term most traditional drop shipping stores provide a terrible customer experience we do not care when you're drop shipping directly from aliexpress you have next to no quality control over your products you have zero control over the shipping lines your supplier is using which causes your customers to have to wait an extremely long time for a product that might not even be that good it's not all bad though there's still a decent amount of good suppliers on aliexpress though it's the lack of control that's the issue and almost always leads to a poor customer experience i want to take a look at one of the biggest aliexpress drop shipping stores of all time this store actually shut down a couple months ago because of this exact reason so if we take a look at the reviews of this store seconds you can see that they have a ton of reviews they have over a thousand reviews and this single-handedly killed their business people are complaining about the exact things that i just mentioned they're complaining about slow delivery times low quality products six weeks to arrive these are the exact issues that you're gonna run into when drop shipping from aliexpress if this store made this small change that we're gonna talk about later in this video they would still be thriving and making sales to this day but as you can see the poor customer experience pretty much just killed the opportunity let's talk about the second biggest problem it is extremely easy for somebody to come and steal your winning product as long as they come in and apply the same tweak that i'm using they're gonna be able to kick you out of the marketplace and outscale you on your own product i've seen this happen time and time again and i've done this to drop shipping stores using my method competition is okay and it's actually really healthy but you have to build a business that makes it difficult for people to come in and compete with you think of it as if you were building a castle and trying to keep people out the best structures always have a gate a bridge and a moat making it extremely complicated for somebody to break in you need to approach building your business in the same way and we'll talk about how to do that very shortly and the last problem which gets super annoying when you're scaling is that everybody wants to shut you down paypal and shopify payments do not like it when you dropship at a high level because since people have to wait a really long time for their product a lot of times they will do a chargeback which really hurts their reputation with the banks which makes shopify and paypal look at you as an unsatisfactory client which usually will end up with them holding a portion of your money or even shutting you down entirely so for these three reasons i'm out but there actually is a way to use drop shipping to build a long-term business it all comes down to using it for the right reasons drop shipping is extremely good for one thing finding your first winning product since you don't have to order inventory it's pretty simple to try out a bunch of products until you find one that's selling consistently and once you find that product you should transition as soon as possible to this this is exactly what the top 100 companies on shopify are doing let me explain instead of focusing on making as much money as possible with drop shipping my goal is to build a long term brand with real value i simply use drop shipping as a means to an end once i had a product that was selling consistently and had potential to grow i decided to build a brand around that product immediately by the way if you need help with that testing process i made a detailed video on how to get started so make sure to check that out but for making this simple change i immediately saw a higher conversion rate much cheaper ad costs people were spending more money on my store and the word started to spread which brought in more repeat customers this simple change took my business to the next level if we look at the graph from day one of starting this business you can see exactly what i'm talking about so in the first month of testing products i made around seven thousand dollars in sales in the following month i made around sixteen thousand dollars and this is when i found that winning product and i transitioned it into a brand at the end of this month and you can see the following month i almost 5xed my revenue just for making that simple change and by the end of the year i had surpassed over a hundred thousand dollars a month in sales and have done that every month ever since so now i'm going to share with you three simple steps to transition your drop shipping store into a brand the first thing i did was completely redesign my store to focus entirely on this product now there's two ways to do this the first way would be to fill your store up with a bunch of products that are similar and go hand in hand with your winning product so this store actually started by scaling this product and since then they expanded by adding a ton of other products and selling those to their list as you can see this brand is bringing in over 500 000 monthly visitors and they're absolutely crushing it the other way is to build out a store entirely for that product itself and build out a suite of products that you can use alongside it so as you can see with one of the biggest shopify stores snow teeth whitening they have the teeth whitening kit whitening wands serum toothpaste and floss it's all really solving the same problem and they go hand in hand together and this store is making millions of dollars a month and they even made it on ellen the other day which is really cool the second step is to work with an agent in china to brand your product order inventory and provide faster shipping for your customers now i've made a whole dedicated video on this topic so if you want to check that i'm going to put it in the card up above once you have a winning product this process is extremely simple these companies are excited to work with you and they're going to do what they can to get you the best price and the best experience for your customers though be careful because there are some untrustworthy agents out there though i can recommend you a good one in the description down below  END"}
{"prompt":"I Tried Dropshipping For One Week! (From Scratch)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" over the last three years i've made millions in sales from dropshipping products on shopify but what would happen if i had to start all over again with just 250 and try to build a profitable store from scratch in just a couple of days well it's time to find out the rules of this challenge are simple i have four days to turn 250 into a profitable shopify store i have to start this from scratch i can't use any of the products or stores that i've used in the past if the store fails and is not profitable i'm going to be giving away 500 to somebody watching this video but if the store is profitable i'm gonna give the store away to one of my subscribers to help you kickstart your ecommerce journey in 2022. but first i need a product so let's go find one Music i think i found the perfect product the product is this custom photo necklace and honestly i think this product is gonna go crazy here's why we're on the holiday season right now and most people are mainly shopping for gifts for their friends and family and this product is a perfect gift and the supplier looks to be really good they have a lot of positive feedback the product quality itself looks really nice lastly the product has already been validated you can see this store has launched the product with the most simple basic advertisement and run up a ton of likes comments and shares which usually translates to sales and the most important thing that i look for with any product that i'm considering to sell is room for improvement now this simple ad worked for them but i know for a fact we can do something better this ad copy is not the greatest the photo is literally the default photo from aliexpress and their website itself works but it's not the best i've ever seen so we have a great product with a trustworthy supplier that's already been validated and has room for improvement it's time to put the work in after about 30 minutes of trying to come up with a name i think i've got a good one the name that we're gonna roll with is eternalized shout out to ubereats for getting me through this late night sesh but i think this name perfectly represents the brand you're taking a family member or a memory and eternalizing it so the game plan is to build a store that's all around custom memorabilia based products to eternalize your loved ones let's see what i come up with but first i gotta eat this food so right now it is about one in the morning and your boy is feeling it so tomorrow the goal is to go through and optimize everything set up my product page and launch my first ads i would love to do all this tonight but i'm tired and i'm ready to clock out it's time i've spent all day working on this store perfecting each and every little thing and i finally feel like it's ready to go so let's take a look i finished up the homepage last night so it didn't really need that much work i pretty much spent the majority of my time today working on this product page and making sure the whole custom photo functionality thing was working as you can see i took the time to find the best quality images and even photoshop our logo into some of them this just increases the perceived value and makes your website look much more trustworthy i kept the photos really simple just mainly trying to show the level of detail that these necklaces actually have for the title i kept it as basic as possible and then i used an app to set up these custom variants so people can upload their own photos and put a name for the necklace the product is self-explanatory so we didn't need some super long description i just wanted to keep it straight and to the point so i went for the angle of keep your loved ones close to your heart i put a picture here showing the before and after and then i talked about what we offer the benefits of ordering from us and every order comes with a gift box but i decided to frame it as a free gift box just to increase the value in the eyes of the customer i put some basic order instructions and then i added some reviews from aliexpress directly onto the website and obviously i had to spend like an hour today setting up all these pages so we have a contact us page an faq page track your order page everything that you need to legally run your business it's all good to go for every app that i used on this store i tried to make sure they all had a free trial so the only thing i've spent money on so far is the domain and it cost me 25 so now i only have a 225 budget to work with for the ads but i think we can do something with that so now i'm gonna go through and set up some facebook ads and i'll show you the finished product when it's all done the ads are officially live so let's take a look so i went with a very simple structure of just running one campaign with a hundred dollar daily budget inside of this campaign i have five different ad sets targeting a couple different angles and i'm only targeting the us right now because that's where the majority of christmas shopping happens for the ad creative i put three different variations the only thing that's different between these three ads is the actual photos so you can see in the first one we have a middle aged kid and the second one we have grandma right here and in the third one we have the original photo that worked well for the competitor so the goal of this campaign is to see which audience and which creative people like the most hopefully get some sales and then we can cut off the ones that aren't performing and put the rest of our budget into the top performing audience and create it and if none of this ends up working i'm gonna have to make a huge pivot but for now let's let's spend some money and see the results i folded a folder that folded i folded i folded unfolded i'm down bad it's been a couple hours since the ad started spending and i've pretty much been checking it non-stop and the results are not that good i've had about 51 visitors come to the website with no add to carts and no sales whatsoever cost per click on facebook was way too high as well so i think i need to go back to the drawing board but for now i just decided to come outside enjoy some of the miami vibes and get back to it tonight it's like no matter how long i've been doing this or how many projects i've started starting something new is always a super big challenge and extremely stressful so if you're starting a new business and you're going through that just know that it's totally normal and part of the process we got this it's another late night right now it's about 1am on the second day let me show you where i'm at yesterday in total i spent 37 on facebook ads i decided to trim the budget down from 100 to 50 because none of these ad sets were really performing that well as you can see the cpms are relatively high and the cost per link clicks were pretty insane i killed the two worst performing ad sets and now have these three left honestly i don't feel that optimistic about this campaign anymore because i realized i made a few crucial mistakes the first mistake was only targeting the us this made sense when i said it earlier but every brand is spending as much money as they can on this market so it's super expensive to advertise here i think the second mistake i made is putting too many different ads inside of each ad set this is something that i always do but i'm not used to being on such a tight budget so what's happening is that it's  END"}
{"prompt":"I Joined Andrew Tate's $5,000 Cult\n\n###\n\n","completion":" imagine if I told you that for just five thousand dollars you could join a secret society as powerful as the Illuminati well apparently that's what Andrew Tate's programs the war room is all about so the war room is is kind of like the Illuminati but cooler started the war room to attract a conglomerate of superheroes it's kind of like Avengers we have over 2 000 members over 600 millionaires but you can get kicked at any moment without a refund and today I'm going to be spending my life savings to go behind the scenes and uncover the secret world that Andrew has created to see if it lives up to the height let's do it here right now on Covert Tate's website they got this crazy video bro shooting guns popping bottles doing all different type of stuff as you can see this is the greatest Global Network which exists on planet Earth notice how they blur everybody's face inside of the War Room like I'm genuinely curious who is inside of here by the end of the day once we get inside I want to try to meet up with somebody in my city and actually interview them because I'm curious what type of people are inside of this thing yeah let's buy it all right so it looks like you can't actually buy it directly I have to actually speak to them to buy it so I want to buy the war room I feel like they do this to make it feel all super exclusive you must be interviewed to get inside all right I just got a message back from Morpheus himself you know uh Mr red pill sir I am as serious as ever and then he says crypto is the only available payment option it's kind of annoying but I guess I'll pay them with some ethereum I I'm really sending money to a trillionaire right now that's crazy hopefully it's worth it man I'm hoping it's worth it for real and almost instantly things took a turn for the worst we're off to a tremendous start already after I sent the money to them through coinbase I immediately got a call from the support team saying that my wallet is now locked for the next two months because the wallet I just sent money to is a blacklisted wallet on the blockchain that probably would have been good to know before I sent the money so now the majority of my crypto is frozen and I got to figure out another way to get them the money you know I don't dislike Andrew I kind of like the guy and I didn't want to dislike the war room either but so far this has not been a good experience then I spent another five thousand dollars to send them money through a different platform and I was finally able to access the war room kind of after 24 hours I finally heard back from them with some interesting news even though I already paid now they're telling me to get inside I have to sign a non-disclosure agreement I'm not gonna lie this makes me a little scared to keep doing this video but let's check it out that's crazy I don't think I'm allowed to share this document with you guys so I'm definitely not gonna do that but basically they're saying if I reveal anything that's inside of the war room I'm liable for millions of dollars in Damages no joke it's kind of scary and it makes you wonder what they're possibly trying to hide inside of there I mean I'm not saying that there's anything bad but that is such a crazy amount to threaten people with but I already paid so there's no turning back now let's sign this document I signed the contract and almost immediately was granted access to the war room I joined excited to see what's inside and hopefully expand my network with some high level people so I spent a couple days in there going through as much as I can to see exactly what it was all about and after spending two days in there my suit collection has literally doubled and I don't even have any regular clothes anymore no but on a more serious note my experience inside the war room so far has been extremely underwhelming and of course to back up my points I want to show you guys exactly what's inside of the war room but to avoid a multi-million dollar lawsuit and protect myself from going bankrupt I had to get creative instead of actually showing you guys the war room I figured we can go inside together and take a tour Music welcome dumb virgin to the War Room upon entering you are welcomed by the first priest who grants you access to the rooms and some required reading by Tate and his team the rooms are basically just a bunch of different group chats inside there are a variety of rooms about various subjects such as making money you don't have money just make more money growing your social media meeting up IRL and of course women and that is why it's better to have six girlfriends than one it's an elite circle of alpha males pushing each other to be better and growing alongside each other and on paper this sounds amazing but after spending a couple days in this community ultimately I was disappointed and the main reason for this was the actual quality of the conversations in these chat rooms I was expecting to see some truly high level conversation from an elite group of men God this man is brilliant it didn't feel like I was talking with Elites it felt more like the Tate fan club and since it's all spread out across over 20 different rooms it lacks structure and there's no clear path to follow as a member which sort of left me confused from the website and the videos on the home page I expected something different I don't know maybe it's just me maybe I'm crazy so I reached out to a couple of the War Room members here in Miami and I found one that's willing to do an interview with me to share how he feels about his experience in the war room and I'm about to be late so we gotta go foreign so how long have you been in the War Room been in the war room now for about four to five months why did you join what made you want to get inside of there I was uh just scrolling Tick Tock a lot and on my for you page I just seen the classic tape videos always popping up and I started to like what this guy was saying so I fell into it I liked some videos and just with the algorithm more and more videos started to appear on my for you page I found out you had a private Network and I looked into the war room and I ended up joining do you feel like the program lived up to the expectations that you had for it this is just like part where I just want to like think about these answers um here no problem maybe run it again yeah I would say it has lived up to the expectations so I was expecting to get access to uh I'm trying to think how to win at high level people because just the average common Joe isn't going to pay five thousand dollars to join a group chat so what percentage of people do you feel like inside of the War Room are actually these high value high level people that is advertised I would say about 25 percent isn't it kind of ironic though that you you pay to join this Elite Circle and the majority of people that are inside of it are still beginners themselves and a lot of them are still just getting started on their journey I would say so yeah I could see where you're coming from but what I recommend to you is just to probably be more involved within it and you could probably find one person which will make joining well worth it I don't know I I would say it was worth the five thousand dollars I paid so the last question for the people that are watching this video would you actually recommend for them to get inside of the war room if five thousand dollars is all  END"}
{"prompt":"How This Makes Him $1,000,000/Week\n\n###\n\n","completion":" did you know you can make millions of dollars buying and selling watches even without any money this is mike the rm plug he turned nothing into a multi-million dollar jewelry empire supplying high-end watches to the world's top entrepreneurs athletes and celebs and today he's going to show me exactly how he did it but first he had a surprise for me all right i got something to look at man a little bit of something a little bit of something what we got here bro how much money and watch is it in there we got to open this ah definitely over it okay so what we got here bro break some of this down all right cool so i need to add this to it because this this is a holy grail right here this piece it's magnificent that's what you're known for right that's the rrm yeah yeah yeah for sure known for the ram because you know like this is the holy grail like nobody people can't touch this it takes a different collarbone you know dealer to be able to touch our ramps it's not like a piece that everybody can just you know sell like that so yeah i definitely want to know more about how you got to that level but first i'm curious if we could just go through and talk about the value of these watches you can make it quick okay cool no problem so 2021 uh ap rose gold and this right now sell for about 155 000 um this one sells right now for 115 000 this one sells for three hundred and eighty thousand dollars and then the big boy right there big boy rm it's only limited to fifty pieces made an award and this one is six hundred thousand dollars thirty five we have thirteen we have about 17 five right here so in total this box what we got about 1.3 million crazy what's the reason that somebody can come to you and buy this watch and they can't go to the richard mills store and get one themselves that's a good question because that's a question that a lot of people ask you like in general so um before you go to pandemic you couldn't walk into a reach a meal store and buy richard mille because richard mille is a company that make limited pieces per year they only make less than 5 000 pieces a year wow that's a huge difference i think the fact that i branded myself so well some people actually think that i work for richard mille but i'm not affiliated officially with the brand people know me as the go-to guy for richard mille let me ask you this with this case right here how long do you think it'll take you to move all this this is our deposit on this this i can sell today if i want to you know like one week just moves pretty fast so it's not uncommon for you to go through a million dollars of watches in a week oh yeah that's that's normal some people might be looking at this like i cannot get to that level this is unattainable so i want to talk a little bit more about that coming for sure absolutely man we're here at the top of miami in this beautiful apartment you didn't start here though bro like where did you come from and how did you end up here grew up in uh west africa and ivory coast to be exact my first biggest challenge was learning english so i had to learn first of all english i went to college went to new york worked in the actual business world or whatever i was a loan officer or whatever for a while and i always had these big dreams of myself like i saw myself like up there and doing big things i just didn't know exactly how it was going to happen i just believed that one day with all my hard work and my determination something was going to happen when i first got into business of course it wasn't like this it wasn't like you know crazy like the way it is right now it was more something that i was interested in i got in i loved it the difference is you actually have an actual heart asset that you can hold in your hand that you can have on your wrist or put in your safe and it actually goes up in value i don't feel like i sell watches i feel like i sell the lifestyle i sell everything else and it watches sell itself i'm not selling something that people don't want people want watches they love watches so i'm not gonna be out yo yo you know what's going on man i have this watch for you man you know every day focus on finding the best pieces right living your life and building good relationships exactly that's exactly what i'm doing then mike offered to give me a ride to show me behind the scenes of his entire jewelry operation what was your first watch deal though when you first got into the game like how did you begin with this my very first watch deal was um it was a rolex it wasn't very expensive i bought the watch actually it was funny i financed that watch online because i had good credit and so i bought the watch on credit i had to put a certain amount of money down and it was like 6 500 or something like that was this a big investment for you it was i couldn't afford a watch obviously so i had to finance it i think i put like i paid a thousand of it for 1300 or something like that and how did you flip that how did you get it sold i racked it for like a month and then i started looking at the market on it and it was worth like seven thousand i waited another month and a half i went to other people that lowballed me and i ended up actually selling that watch on a ferrari he enemy 7 200 and at the time that was the most money you ever had that yeah yeah it wasn't like i was trying to do this for a living you know what i'm saying it was just wanted to try it right yeah yeah so now i could take the whole money cash and then pay this watch little by little i was only paying 300 and use that money to get your next watch and that's what you did right yeah that's amazing bro if you could go back to that day when you were there starting in this game just picked up your first watch on credit what would you tell that mike what would you tell him i wish you that finance two three more watches we have to factor here with george he pretty much runs all the diamonds side of it we're gonna go in here he's gonna talk to us about like what's going on in the back end so i want to check it out y'all ready let's do it all right over here is where we start the process from a to z just to give you an example like this is one of our works right here we start everything from the basis everything your house everything you come for is in-house it's like right here he's setting a piece right now setting the diamond and let's take a look this is where the final stage is going and then it comes to the other side of the factory so start to finish how long does it take to make a piece like that a piece like this would take anywhere between two to three weeks max when you're taking anything from him you just know that he's in on all the production from start to finish he's in on everything from the color selection diamond selection from a to z he's involved diamonds are up 40 from last month so i don't mind in a month so that mean everyone that's bought a custom piece from us from back then to today is up especially considering the quality that you guys put out of the day there you go so if you were to break it down or those diamonds are timeless my god after we left mike threw on some roddy rich and told me one of the most inspirational stories i've ever  END"}
{"prompt":"How To Design A Shopify Store In 10 Minutes (Step-By-Step)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" having a bad website will kill your chances of success on shopify even if you have the best products and ads it's so much harder to see results with a low quality store so in this video i'll be sharing the exact store template that i'm using right now to generate over a hundred thousand dollars a month and i'll be showing you step by step exactly how to easily build one for yourself if you're new here my name is jordan and i'm currently documenting the entire process of growing my ecommerce brand with as much transparency as possible so if you're interested in starting your own online business make sure to subscribe for new videos every single friday also just want to say thank you guys so much for 50 000 subscribers so to give back to you guys i'm gonna do something that i usually don't do i'm gonna give away a free one-on-one coaching call to one of you to enter the giveaway just drop a comment down below follow me on instagram and dm me when you're done i'll be announcing the winner for this next friday anyways let's get started with the video first things first here are some live results that i'm getting with this exact template so as you can see halfway through the day i've already done over 2500 in sales and if we look at yesterday's stats you can see that this store is averaging around five thousand dollars a day everybody is always asking about profit so let's take a look yesterday i did around fifteen hundred dollars in profit and today so far halfway through the day i'm at around in profit which is close to 30 daily margin i'm not showing this to brag but just to prove that this layout is working today i figured the best way to explain this would be to make a sample store that follows this exact template so that's what i did let's have a look at that sample store so this is a store that i created in the home and garden niche the type of stores that i like to build to test products look just like this basically we're building a nice clean branded store with good logo good images multiple collections inside of that niche high quality products and images and overall a trustworthy and legitimate feel i get dms every single day of people asking me why am i struggling to see results and then i look at their store and it looks like this if you take the time to make a nice clean branded website seeing success with ecommerce is going to be so much easier this kind of store is perfect for testing products because it is branded it has a trustworthy feel but it's also broad enough that you can test a variety of products without being too constrained i like to call this kind of store a hybrid store it basically bridges the gap between a general and niche store building a store like this is really not that difficult so i'm gonna break down how to do it right now the first thing that you're gonna need to come up with is a clean name and logo to come up with names i highly recommend you guys check out this tool called lean domain search basically you can take any word or phrase that you like and plug it into here and they're gonna show you websites that are ready to go that have this word inside of it so in my case i used the word flora because it fit perfectly for the home and garden space and i scrolled and scrolled until i found the name flora flow which i really like all of the names on this website are available to purchase for the com domain right away so i would take some time and try to come up with at least five phrases that would fit with your branding so now that you've come up with a name you need to create a logo now i know graphic design might be intimidating to a lot of you but nowadays there are a ton of tools that make it incredibly simple one of my favorite tools to do this is actually called canva canva has a bunch of these logo templates already built into the app and it's actually what i use to build the flora flow logo you can literally scroll through their library and find a clean logo for your brand in seconds and know this video is not sponsored by them i just really like their product so as you can see the template that i use for the floraflow logo is right here i literally typed in flower i looked at the options i found this one and i just simply typed in the logo name and then i made it a little bigger centered it in the middle and i deleted the bottom and i made a logo for the brand in 10 seconds now look it's going to take you longer than 10 seconds and you shouldn't rush the process but i would highly advise you guys use that tool to build your logo i'm also a big fan of photoshop for my brand that i'm running right now i designed my logo in photoshop but it's a lot more advanced and not very beginner friendly once you've got a name and a logo the next step is to build out a nice home page for your store now when you're running ads to this store typically you're going to send people to the product pages yeah you might have a cool product you might have a cool product page but if your customer starts browsing around your website and they get a weird vibe they're not going to spend money with you and even if they do the chances of them remembering your brand and buying again are so slim so this is the exact layout that i use for all of my home pages let's break it down there are a ton of themes to use on shopify and it can kind of be overwhelming this store is actually built on the impulse theme which is by far one of my favorite paid themes and if you're looking for a good free theme i recommend that you guys check out debutify i've used both of them and personally i like impulse a little better but if you're on a low budget debutify is an amazing option first things first we need a nice and clean header try to come up with something creative that introduces the people to your brand in a very inviting way now i could have easily wrote the best products for your home and garden but i think it's much better to put something that has a little bit more flair and life to it so in this example i put stylus essentials for the modern home designed to elevate your lifestyle if you're struggling with copywriting just go look at some of the biggest brands out there in terms of this image and all the images on the site shopify actually provides a bunch of really sick free images and a lot of people don't know about this so if you go down to image and you click on change and you go to free images you can search up almost anything so in my case i searched up flower and you'll see that shopify has a bunch of these really nice high quality images that they're constantly updating almost every single week and they're really fire the next thing i do is typically put one of our collections on display in this case it's the best sellers because those are my favorite products on the store so i wanted to put those front and center and when they click on it you're gonna see that these are our top selling products and a nice clean organized page we also give them an offer with up to fifty 50 off on the select products and it's just something that gives them some incentive to click and start shopping the next thing that i really like to do is show some type of mission statement for the brand i think  END"}
{"prompt":"How I Built 5 Income Streams That Make $86,730 Per Month\n\n###\n\n","completion":" as someone who makes educational content it is extremely important that i practice what i preach so in this video i'm going to be breaking down my five income sources that generate me over 80 000 a month and i'll be sharing exactly how i built them so you can learn to do it for yourself if you're new here my name is jordan and i'm currently documenting the entire journey of building my online business with as much transparency as possible so if you're interested in starting your own online business make sure to subscribe down below for new videos every single friday by the way if you're curious about the background change i'm in tulum mexico for the week but you already know we still gotta keep the uploads consistent so without further ado let's get started Music so since the age of 13 i've been on a mission to become a full-time entrepreneur so all throughout middle and high school i tried and failed with so many business ideas i tried to do it all from starting a clothing brand reselling sneakers making youtube videos everything under the sun that i could to make a dollar after graduating high school i had nothing that was working and i wasn't working a job so i had to go to college during my first year of college i followed the same path trying so many different business ideas and it wasn't until the summer after my first year that i had my big break and now at 23 years old i have multiple streams of income that allow me to live my life on my own terms so let's break them down so my first stream of income and my primary focus is my shopify brand this is pretty much what my entire youtube channel is about so if you want to learn more about shopify make sure to check out some of my other videos after watching this one so today is april 21st we're a little more than halfway through the month right now it's around 1 pm and you can see that my shopify store has done around 3 300 in sales and over 113 000 this month in revenue now sales and revenue literally mean nothing the most important part is profit and that's what i consider to be income so let's break that down as you can see in the last 30 days my shopify store has brought in around 38 000 in profit which is around a 23 profit margin now typically with a shopify store you're going to see margins from 10 to 25 so in my opinion this is not bad but of course there's still room for improvement this store actually started out as a drop shipping store but over the last year i've spent a ton of time and money to really turn this into a full brand i ship my products from the united states we have a custom logo we've customized our product and it even comes in a nice fancy custom package i also have a ton of custom photo and video content that nobody else has so my goal is to continue investing and building this brand to the point where one day i can sell it for over seven figures i truly believe that e-commerce is one of the best opportunities in this time and it has completely changed my life but it's not easy and it will take time for you to see results okay so my second stream of income is my youtube adsense so youtube actually pays me every single time an ad pops up on one of my videos and thankfully you guys have been supporting me so much which i'm extremely grateful for and my channel has been growing pretty quickly so as you can see in the last 30 days of my youtube channel i brought in around 13 700 in revenue which is pretty much 100 profit on average the channel makes anywhere from 300 to 700 a day which is really good and in a way it's sort of like passive income that being said i put a lot of time and effort into making these videos for you guys i have not missed a single upload all year so it is not easy i started my first youtube channel when i was 12 years old making funny little videos with my friends so in a way this was all meant to be if you look right here you can see the growth of this channel in november i only made two hundred dollars in january i made a thousand dollars and now in march we're past that five figure a month level i hope one day to get to graham stefan level revenue maybe 100k a month from youtube but let's take it one day at a time i'm grateful where i'm at right now my next stream of income and honestly one of my biggest is my software company so around three years ago i developed a product research software called viral vault so essentially it is a tool that delivers you two products every single day that are ready to sell on your shopify store basically i wanted to create the all-in-one toolkit for a beginner looking to start their online store we provide you with everything that you need to sell the product so we give you the description the price the video ad copy and everything else that you would need and it's been a really rocky journey there have been many highs and lows but this year we're off to a great start so as you can see with this software i generated around fifty six thousand dollars in cash and as it currently stands we're doing around fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars a day in revenue which i am extremely grateful for i would say hands down this is the hardest project i've ever embarked on i spent over a year without making a single dollar from this company and invested over a hundred thousand dollars of my own money to build this thing but now it's doing pretty well we have a very active community and a ton of people are getting results with our app each month this app cost me around ten thousand dollars to maintain so our profits are around forty to fifty thousand dollars a month so from just those three income sources i'm making over eighty thousand dollars a month in profit now i have two more streams of income that are a little more inconsistent but i'd like to grow them even further the first one is brand deals and affiliate marketing since my channel has been growing there have been a ton of companies reaching out to promote their apps and product now i'm not the type to just promote anything and everything i only like promoting stuff i use myself so it's pretty rare that i take a brand deal these days though in the last month i have promoted two companies i promoted shopify and alibaba so as you can see in the last month shopify has paid me 290 and 435 dollars for promoting their partner program and legally i can't disclose how much money alibaba paid me but i did a video for them a couple weeks ago and they cut me a decent check for that video and my last stream of income that i've honestly been slacking on is investing every single month i invest around 10 to 20 of my income into index funds now i know there's so many people that are out there doing these major dogecoin and gamestop swing trades but for me i just haven't been able to get into it so i've just been slowly dumping a small percentage of my money into these long-term investments and i hope that it'll pay off in the long run with this strategy my investment accounts make me anywhere from one to five thousand dollars a month in fully passive income i'm sure if i put more effort into day trading and crypto trading i could probably be making 50 to 100k a month just off that alone but as you can see i've got a pretty full plate there's a lot of stuff i work on each day and like i said i've kind of been  END"}

like getting into the sneaker game so getting into the sneaker game was actually pretty obviously a long process before I got anywhere right I started pretty small the only reason I got into just selling things online was actually my parents they kind of told me that I needed to either get a job or do something with my summer and they basically forced me to sell all the stuff around the house you know I realized that it wasn't really interesting for me to sell my parents old stuff I wanted to sell things that I actually enjoyed and at that time it was sneakers the way I mostly in the beginning started scaling my business was really through like social media like Instagram I would say the biggest turning point in my business would have been coveted there was a ton of sales that I was able to take advantage of from websites and also a ton of you know end consumers were shopping exclusively online so that boosted a lot of the prices and the sales for all all these sneakers now two years later you guys are doing pretty insane volume right how many shoes would you say you're selling a year do you know that number so in a year I want to say last year upwards of maybe 40 000 units last year maybe something like that um Essence just last year how do you actually acquire the shoes a lot of people are going to see a room like this like how are they getting the connections how are they picking up all these shoes at a price how do you do that part of the business so you obviously have to Source the more exclusive stuff and more quantity from other Sellers as well I can put it on my Instagram story I need this and people will you know respond all the time with the product for sale I would say even sourcing it from sneaker conventions so Sneaker Convention is a big thing um we want to do that more so now that we have a store because we're able to Source very specific things so we're actually going to a sneaker event soon in San Francisco Sneaker Con Bay Area so yeah we'll tag along with you guys yeah let's do it I think we should actually give away a pair to one of the viewers so they could get started in their reselling Journey what do you think yeah that's a great idea let's do it which one would be the best one for us to give away this one for sure what are those panda dogs this is the classic shoe everyone needs a pair of these but I think this would be great to help anyone get started how much you think they can sell them for probably around like 200 250 something like that easy well look if you guys want to join that giveaway make sure to subscribe to the channel follow hype Miami on Instagram follow my Instagram and drop a comment down below but for now let's head to sneaker we made it to Sneaker Con so what's the goal today what are we looking for and how much are we going to be spending well hopefully my goal is to spend about 20 30 000 between today and tomorrow looking for the best sellers right now for the store and wholesale well look let's walk around and maybe talk about some of the things that people should be looking for if they're trying to get into reselling still so we're in the trading pit right now this is where I started about five six years ago the best way to make money you know flipping sneakers real quick how much money you think you need to get started in reselling today honestly with shoes being a low ticket item I would say 500 is a great start you can buy one maybe even a few Pairs and get yourself going so the way these events kind of work is back in the trading pit it's more used not as much variety so the prices you can be able to get some steals in there tables is when the prices become a little bit higher but you can still negotiate with them if you're taking a decent amount of products and of course you got the people walking around yeah yeah yeah so a lot of times with these events you don't really know the market value of everything off top of your head so you got to check apps like stock kicks and goats check the market value what are you looking at there all right I just noticed for example The Paisley dogs so if I'm looking at them on stockx you know on average they're going for around 175 to 200 you know so if I can purchase them in the 160 to 170 margin you're good for me you want to go for it let's try it out how you doing boss how much you're asking on the paisleys 200 okay yeah I'd probably be a little lower let's take them all probably like 160 165. 180. always got to compare she has hundreds of shoes it's hard to know the market especially because it changes too all right I mean I'd be able to do best like 170 on the paisleys and that'd probably be at like 175 on the valerians Music oh yeah let's do it 175 oh first the other day bro what the hell are those shoes up here I've never seen those before those are crazy what are those going for now 2000 yeah there's most shoes like that are tougher beginners I would say because it's really hard to get a margin on those so I recommend starting with stuff that moves quicker I'd rather spend 2 000 on 10 pairs of shoes than 2001 pair of shoes so how many pairs did you buy and how much in total is that going to cost you so we just picked the 10 pairs at 175 each so it's about 17.50 yeah we bought 10. Music all right let's get it let's do it so how long do you think it'll take you to move these all of these would probably sell within a month or two how much do you think you'll be able to sell each pair for in your shop so in our shop you have a lot better margins obviously we'll probably put them anywhere from 250 to 300. this table was empty only 15 minutes ago Music I got it oh so you spent thousands of dollars today so far right most people come into these conferences though they don't have that type of money to spend so if you were coming here with a couple hundred dollars what's something that you would buy oh actually this guy just came here and sold us a size 10 350. easy so how much did those cost these were 300. got you so I would say it's a pretty good deal and you want to see if we can sell it here yeah let's try to flip it all right  END"}
{"prompt":"I Tried Making Money With NFTs\n\n###\n\n","completion":" right now thousands of people are making millions of dollars buying and selling nfts now you might be thinking what the  __  is the nft and i've been wondering the same exact thing so i decided to spend the next seven days learning as much as i can and trying to make a profit with nfts but first we got to understand what this is all about nfts seem complicated but the concept is simple basically you're buying verified ownership of a digital item like art or music just like when you buy a car you get a title or when you buy a house you get a deed you're buying a contract that proves that you own that item it's not much different from traditional art collecting except it's all digital and recently there has been a ton of hype around them with people like jay-z logan paul and even visa banks spending millions of dollars to buy this digital art which has caused hundreds of thousands of regular everyday people to jump into the marketplace and prices have gone way up because of this for example let's look at the number one rated nft project they're called crypto punks and as you can see they're selling for up to 7.5 million dollars the cheapest punk you can buy right now is 370 000 us dollars now i don't plan on buying any crypto punks but this marketplace is too big to not give this a try so let's see what i can do all right i just bought my second nft the first one i bought was to try everything out and understand the system and i was actually able to flip that first one for around a ten percent gain but because of all the fees i actually didn't end up making any money so this one is the one i feel like i'll make my first profit on so this right here is the nft i bought this is a project that launched around two days ago and it's been going extremely viral on twitter and i think it has a lot of potential to grow if you look at the top nfts in the last 24 hours you can see it's right there at number 11 and this thing just launched i literally have no idea what i'm doing but i think this is a good idea so i'm gonna shop around i'll probably buy another one tonight and i'll update you guys tomorrow it's literally 3 a.m i'm still up studying this but i just bought another nft i just purchased this al cabone which is a new project that just came out and this picture has still yet to render so i have no idea what the actual nft will be and when it launches there is a potential for this value to go way up or it can go way down even if i lose all my money i am not too stressed about it if you're going to do something like this make sure you only invest money that you're totally comfortable with losing this is the way to do it is i'm having fun it's the next morning i'm actually about to head to the gym and i checked my gmail and i'm super hyped both of the nfts i bought last night actually ended up selling while i was asleep which made me a total of 953 dollars in profit now of course there's a lot of fees and stuff on the back end but i would say i made at least 500 profit off these two sales and i literally bought these last night at the last minute put them up and they sell while i was asleep so i'm gonna try to take these profits now and roll them into something else and also there's a new project that's launching today and it's going to be minted which means i can be one of the very first people to buy the project so i think i'm going to do that for this one and that will be a big w or it won't so far so good though i'm about to go work out i came home and made a crazy play let me show you what i did i went through and minted this new project which is these right here so i bought it early and once it releases these are gonna become different characters and if they're rare i'll be able to make good money off them even if they're not rare because i bought it for such a cheap price i will be able to flip these for a profit this is a bigger project probably one of the more expensive nfts i bought you see with 0.68 but i think it's pretty cool and it'll probably sell in the next couple of days and then this is another one that i minted and as you can see it has yet to release yet so once these six nfts release i think my portfolio should go up significantly but at the same time i have no idea what i'm talking about so let's see what happens and i'll update you guys very soon i just took three massive l's in one day i'm talking about my momentum is gone let me show y'all what happened so these two were actually the ones that i was the most excited for this is a brand new project that i bought early before the actual art has even been revealed just because it was super hyped and i knew that people were interested so i spent around five thousand dollars on two of them today in the discord i got the news that the reveal is gonna be postponed for another week and once that news went live the price of this thing went down to the bottom i was expecting these to be revealed today and double my money but what actually happened was that i lost all the profit i've made so far in this challenge and these things are the eggs that you saw before that finally hatched and they look so stupid like look at this little hippo i'm not into this art i'm not into this project at all and the value of them on the marketplace is less than what i paid for them and i actually think this guy is cool and he will eventually sell but 99 of my portfolio is garbage and i don't know what to do because nobody wants to buy any of this stuff so at this point i'm thinking about putting more money in and buying a real solid project instead of these little tiny projects that are gonna hopefully blow up buying into something that's already established obviously in the nfc world that would be a crypto punk but i can't afford a crypto punk so i've been looking into a few other options i'll let you know what i decided to do it's been a full day since the last update and i have some news to share this nft game started to stress me out so i took a small break yesterday the only thing i really did was i listed all those ugly hippos for sale at the lowest price possible i sold each of them for a loss i guess i could have held them for a bit longer to make some profit but i was getting tired of looking at them the other two that i bought before the release day have just shot down in value so i'm just waiting until those get revealed which is gonna be after i post this video so i'm basically taking an l on those last night i found this project that i really liked the art was super cool and the price was going up and up so i bought  END"}
