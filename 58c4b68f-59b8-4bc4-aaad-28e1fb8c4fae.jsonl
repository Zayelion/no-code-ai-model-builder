I never realised that digital marketing could also be a profession I could pursue back in 2008. I connected with users on social media platforms to promote events and products to them as an influencer.\n\nMy passion for marketing started in school, and I learned in detail about the subject during my MBA days. However, the theory I learned during those days was helpful for me, and applying that knowledge in a practical world through internships and live projects made me fall in love with the digital space. I loved the influence digital medium offered and how powerful it is for businesses and brands to reach out to their audience.\n\nI love the social media space and with my personal brand, I want to help people build their personal brand on social media. The power of personal branding is tremendous as it allows us to take control of the narrative and offers multiple opportunities to grow and build credibility in our niche. \n\nThrough my amazing community of over 40K people across all channels, I want to inspire people to start sharing the journey with the world. With the amazing speaking opportunities I get, I encourage the community to start with their digital journey. \n\nMy vision is to inspire people to consciously build their personal brand and leverage its opportunities to better their lifestyle. \n\nMy current work projects include helping teams and businesses with:\n* Generating leads\n* Brand visibility\n* Optimising ads for paid campaigns\n* Building organic brand presence\n* Build a personal brand for leaders\n\nWorking in teams and generating ideas with experts have helped me gain industry insights and learn a few tricks, which helped me develop my marketing skill.\n\nI am always on the lookout for experiencing new platforms and services as I love to be the early adopter and gain the advantage at an early stage.\n\nI am also the host of \"Let's talk LinkedIn\" on Twitter space.

You know you're good at what you do. But no matter how hard you try, you aren't signing clients consistently and/or hitting those 5-figure/months even though you're constantly posting content on LinkedIn or Facebook (or anywhere else you spend your marketing time)\n\nNewsflash... You have a MESSAGING problem or you're having little to no CONVERSATIONS with your dream clients.\n\nBut, if you're still reading and all you struggle with is not having enough time for client fulfillment, family, and life and you want to scale your time and cash flow... then read on. \n\nI have a solution for both, but I‚Äôll only focus on conversations as that fixes the first problem. \n\nBACKSTORY: In 2018, I met a business coach who told me she knew what my superpower is. I asked her what it is. Instead, she asked me to generate leads for her. She hit $21k in revenue that month from the leads I sent her way. She then told me that my superpower is building human connections.\n\nI believed her because in all the 8 years I spent in sales, clients loved me. As a result, I met my targets effortlessly and my colleagues asked me to tell them how I did it. Thinking of it now, I realize that every time they asked, I‚Äôd tell them to care more about the prospect than the sale. \n\nAfter I met this coach, I learned that human connections are one of the best ways of knowing what people want and seeing if what you provide can help them or not. \n\nTHE SOLUTION: Done right, conversations can help you build relationships. Relationships can help you get sales. Sales can help you test your offer for proof of concept, understand the problems your dream clients are facing on a deeper level, and ace your messaging.\n\nThey may take a few minutes, an hour, a day, a week, or a year before you see results. They depend on you and how well you know whom you serve and the transformation you provide.\n\nWHAT TO DO: If you‚Äôre currently averaging $4k-$8k per month in your business and not creating those 5-figure months yet, DM me today.\n\nI‚Äôll ask you a few questions to be sure you have the basics in place to be successful (and recoup your investment) ‚Äî and if yes, I‚Äôll invite you in.

Here's a few things you should know:\n\nFor the last 10 yrs I've made my living as a sales professional (and now trainer) and while I never imagined myself in this career, I've found the art of sales to be a fascinating craft and one that has led me to become a better version of myself. On my journey to sales mastery I've become a better listener, more empathetic, a more creative thinker, more emotionally resilient, and gotten even clearer on my values. \n\nI believe sales is a craft that can be mastered in the same ways that others are mastered. Rather than being a matter of \"you've either 'got it' or you don't\", I have found that success in sales is a matter of mastering a number of specific skills through deliberate practice. In fact, I believe this so strongly that I co-founded The Practice Lab as a place where sellers can gather to hone their craft in the same way masters of other disciplines hone theirs. \n\nIn recent years I've come to recognize just how many privileges I have in life, and feel strongly my responsibility to use those privileges in the service of those who do not have them. This has led me to get involved in supporting a number of social justice causes with my time, words, and actions. \n\nBoth in personal and professional contexts I believe in honest, authentic, and even vulnerable relationships. This affects how I work with colleagues, how I show up in my online content, the transparency and candor I bring into sales interactions, and everything in between. \n\nI have a wife and three kids and work a lot so I really don't have a ton of hobbies outside of hanging out with them. However, I live in the beautiful state of Colorado and make it a point to get out and go hiking at least once a month. That's where I go to take care of my mental health when life starts to wear me down. \n\nThink we could be friends? Shoot me a connection request and let's see where it leads us! END"}

I check for: sense, language (spelling, punctuation, grammar), style consistency (capitalisation, headings, date format), accuracy, missing words, URLs and more! \n\nüíª Proof-editing is ideal if you want more than a traditional proofread but not a deep or developmental edit.

{"prompt":"Write a unique LinkedIn bio that is minimum 1200 characters and maximum 2600 characters long. Use native-level English.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hi, I'm Angelique Hersman. I translate your texts from English into Dutch. \n\nOver the past eight years, I have translated all kinds of texts, from corporate business information to PiLs for clinical trials and everything in between. For instance, one of my recent translation assignments was a presentation on how to use a specific psychological test. I translated the presentation in such a way that people were not distracted by all kinds of expensive terms. This made it easier for the reader to consume all the insights offered.\n\nLooking back, it was pretty clear which way this was going. As an example, I really enjoyed translating veterinary topics. And I translated remarkably much on Human Resources and employee satisfaction. Logically, these two areas suit me well; I trained and volunteered as a veterinary assistant and livestock farmer, and I am currently studying organisational psychology.\n\nWhat really stood out? The dozens, almost hundreds of Safety Data Sheets I have translated over the past few years. To do that well, I put in many hours of research. The same has been the case with clinical trial documentation and patient-side information.\n\nSome strict protocols and instructions must be followed meticulously for these documents. It is also a must that you are and stay abreast of current European legislation in that area. It turns out that this is where my strength lies. I am a whiz at (literature) research, finding my answers in every nook and cranny of the global internet and not being fobbed off with superficial gibberish. And without a source reference, it doesn't even count.\n\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nI translate your English texts into Dutch. While doing that, I ensure that this translated text sounds catchy and natural, so the reader feels addressed. Where necessary, I adapt it to our national preferences. For example, we Dutch are really unhappy with the typical English writing style. \"Geen woorden maar daden\" (actions speak louder than words), we are quick to say in undiluted Rotterdam style.\n\nAlthough I have a broad general interest, there are areas in which my qualities come into their own. For instance, they require specific skills, such as tightly regulated documents or experience. \n\nMy translation skills come to their fullest in projects in:\n\n‚úî Veterinary and animal health\n‚úî Healthcare, medical care and documentation for clinical trials (PILs, ICFs and SmPCs)\n‚úî Human resources and HS&E, and the previously discussed Safety Data Sheets.

Luckily enough, LinkedIn lets me go into further detail. üëá\n\nHOW CAN THIS SPANISH, WEIRD, LONG-HAIRED MAN HELP YOU\n\nIn many ways.

It's on my Featured section down below. But I'll summarise it for you here:\n\nüëâ Transcreation is what a bilingual copywriter does when a translated text loses its mojo.\n\nI'm a copywriter. I'm bilingual. I've done plenty of translation work in the past. And I've seen some baaaaaaad Spanish versions of website copy, ads and videogames.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The translations were fine. They were accurate, well-written and sounded natural. That's what a translator does. \n\nBut they didn't take the target audience into consideration. They didn't elicit the same emotion. They didn't convince customers to take action. And that's what a copywriter is supposed to do.\n\nIf you merge those two, you get a transcreator. You could see them as copywriters who can write comfortably in two languages. Or translators who are willing to rip your originals apart and build something from scratch.\n\nOr as someone who can help you be a star abroad.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting more Spanish love and customers, e-mails make me happy.\n\nüôÉ hola@vicgimenez.com END"}

Two simple steps done right will make things fall into place almost immediately.\n\nLinkedIn works like a very simple sales funnel. \n\nYou attract people to your business by writing posts and commenting on other people‚Äôs posts.\n\nYour material catches the eye of potential customers, so they pop over to your Profile to learn more about you. \n\nAnd if they like what they see there‚Ä¶ they send you a DM and begin a sales conversation.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs it. Just two steps: \n\n- post material to get attention to your Profile\n\n- convert those visitors to leads\n\nIf you‚Äôre not reliably signing new business on LinkedIn, it‚Äôs usually the Profile that‚Äôs letting things down. That can cost you some serious income - but it‚Äôs a resolvable problem. \n\nThing is, your Profile is not just a nice-to-have. Because for someone viewing your LinkedIn Profile this is a moment of decision. \n\nOnce they've read it, one of two things is going to happen: \n\n- they'll either decide to make contact with you - and you just got yourself a new sales lead\n\n- or they'll click away and look at cute kittens on Facebook instead. No sales lead. \n\nYour LinkedIn Profile strongly influences which of these two paths they take. And that makes all the difference to your own bottom line. \n\nThe very best Profiles are business differentiators. They leave the reader in no doubt that you‚Äôre capable, credible - and can resolve difficulties, solve problems and provide measurable advantages to their lives or business. \n\nSocial Revampp creates powerfully persuasive Profiles that do exactly this. \n\nIf you‚Äôre an ambitious business owner who wants to build your fortune on LinkedIn, then we'll create for you:\n\n1. A striking, attention-catching LinkedIn banner image that sets a strong, reassuring first impression of you\n\n2. Your personal video: a short introduction, a brief value statement and a clear call-to-action that emphasises the value you offer your customers - and creates unique engagement between you and them\n\n3. Sales copy: headlines, your video script and - crucially - your About section all written by our direct response copywriters and designed to subtly - but powerfully - persuade your visitor to take that next step.\n\nThere‚Äôs 800 million users on LinkedIn and amongst them are enough ideal clients to keep you busy for the rest of your life. \n\nBelieve me, your Profile can make it happen.\n\nDrop me a DM, tell me how your LinkedIn experience is going and let‚Äôs talk.

If it were, everyone would be doing it.

Writing in a way that grabs attention, holds it, and makes my readers look at things in a new light is what I do best.\n\nFor 15 years in my earlier career (I know, I don‚Äôt look old enough), I worked as an account executive in B2B. I learned a lot in that time about what it meant to really listen to my clients. I researched their business, I zoned in on their pain points, and then put together a solution that met their problems head-on. \n\nI know some people are born to sell, but even though I was good at it, it drained me from my very core. My real joy has always laid in content creation. Combining the dying art form of listening with ample research and my love of writing, meant that I knew I was well placed to create some really special stuff for some really special people.\n\nI guess AppsFlyer saw this in me, and now almost 2 years into working at this stellar company, I write everything from delicious blogs, goodies-packed guides and data-rich reports, to sparkling web copy, irresistible email sequences and punchy social media campaigns. \n\nI also spend time copy editing the work of others. I‚Äôm paid to do it, but I‚Äôm also a perfectionist, so I‚Äôd probably do it anyway. \n\nI‚Äôm not one of those people who blows smoke up the ass of their employer to put themselves firmly at the front line when they‚Äôre handing out pay rises, but when I know I‚Äôm onto a good thing ‚Äì I say it. \n\nI love working at AppsFlyer, because I get to do what I love and I get to do it around truly awesome, kind and talented people. With a genuine focus on customer happiness and employee wellbeing, I‚Äôm well looked after, as well as given everything I need to do the best possible job for our customers.\n\nAway from work, my family is my rock and my safe space in any storm, but if I start writing about them, I‚Äôll never stop. \n\nSo, let‚Äôs get back to work.

My strong suits are:\n\nContent & SEO strategy - Setting up winning aspirations, defining where to play and how to win choices, and establishing the management systems and capabilities required to win with content & SEO.\n\nProcesses and frameworks - Producing results through content and SEO can sometimes feel like running a marathon where there's barbed wire or a concrete block on the road every 200 meters. Good processes and frameworks clear these blocks and increase the quality and speed of execution.\n\nOwning and reporting on results - Hitting numbers rocks, reporting on hitting numbers even more. And when I don't hit the numbers, I'm not afraid to own it and dig until the reason and fix are found.\n\nEvangelizing and education - I like talking about content and SEO as much as I like the trade itself. Give me a stage and an hour of your time and I'll explain exactly why it is that content and SEO are a winning combination.\n\nLeading a team - When you run a marketing function, you're only as strong as your team. Whether they are direct reports, colleagues, or external experts, my team is number one. Making sure they feel safe, valued, heard, and get the chance to develop and grow themselves is the main priority.\n\nPushing for change - Even though content marketing is close to turning 20, there are still many people that don't see its benefits. I've worked in several situations with coworkers oblivious or reluctant to embrace content and SEO for their worth. With a combination of conviction, enthusiasm, and results I've won over many hearts, souls, and generated money for the business.\n\nPersonal development - A day not learned, is a day not lived. I immerse myself in books, courses, and expert communities to stay current and push myself to be better every day. END"}

It not only paid for my entire education but helped me become financially independent as a teenager.\r\n\r\nHowever, I exited that project and continued with my college and freelance development. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 20, I met my first co-founder Oscar Hernandez (He has been my co-founder ever since in everything that we do), known as Power Up Hosting; I ran the company for over 7-years before exiting. \r\n\r\nAt 24, I started India's first PBN Hosting platform, which I later exited in 2017. \r\n\r\nMy life changed when I launched my third startup, which failed severely and changed my whole life. \r\n\r\nIt taught me some of the most valuable life lessons, including management, team hiring, and more. \r\n\r\nThe failure of my third startup gave me the idea of PitchGround (My most successful startup to date, currently valued at $20m as of 2022). PitchGround is a SaaS Marketplace that bridges the gap between early-stage SaaS companies and early adopters, small-medium-sized businesses. \r\n\r\nWith over 92% of the SaaS companies failing in the first three years of their business, our mission was to resolve this unresolved market worth over $200 billion. \r\n\r\nDuring this journey, I met my second co-founder Lukas Liesis, building the company's core foundation. \r\n\r\nLaunched PitchGround on the 25th of September 2018, PitchGround has done over $5m in sales as a bootstrapped company, something our entire team is proud of. \r\n\r\nPitchGround has helped hundreds of companies and has seen over 80% of companies succeeding who are launching with us, out of which 15% of the companies can successfully raise capital post launching their SaaS on our platform. \r\n\r\nAt PitchGround, we firmly believe in our 3P philosophy for any founder who wants to achieve a product-market fit - Product, People & Pricing (Same format). \r\n\r\nIn 2021, I started Angel Investment, and so far, I have invested in 24 startups; I mentor some of them to give back to the community. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, I rebuilt my previous failure, known as https://firstsales.io, which is doing $500k ARR in just 5 months.\r\n\r\nIf you are a small business, do check out PitchGround and save up to 95% on your software bills - website link\n\nGot any questions or want to connect with me?

That attention was the new currency and would play a major part in my success as an entrepreneur.\n\nSo, I started building my brand on LinkedIn in early 2019.\n\nAnd the results were pretty phenomenal.\n\nIn just 6 months I grew from zero followers to over 20,000.\n\nAnd on August 1st of 2019, I walked away from my executive role at a fast-growing startup.\n\nSince that day, I've spent my time building a number of one-person internet businesses.\n\nMy mission is to be the \"Diversified Solopreneur.\"\n\nMy portfolio:\n\n‚Üí I'm an investor at GTM Fund, investing in exciting, early-stage B2B SaaS companies.\n‚Üí I advise early-stage SMB SaaS companies in the healthcare technology vertical.\n‚Üí I mentor entrepreneurs in LATAM via the 500 Startups mentorship program.\n‚Üí I've built one 7-figure, & two 6-figure digital products for creators.\n\nMy results:\n\n‚Üí 335k+ people following my journey on LinkedIn\n‚Üí 260k+ people following my journey on Twitter\n‚Üí 475M+ impressions in the last 4 years\n‚Üí $3.2M+ in self-employed income\n‚Üí Zero advertisements\n‚Üí 94% margins\n\nIf you want to learn more about how I did this, you can take one of my self-guided courses.
